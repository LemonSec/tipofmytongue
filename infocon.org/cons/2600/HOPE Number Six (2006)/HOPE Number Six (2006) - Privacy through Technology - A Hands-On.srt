1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,360
32 to install use the tools and

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:09,860
this is what we're gonna show you in in
the next hour on the second project is

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,269
not as cute so I'm

4
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:16,500
I'm sorry for the quality we're trying
to show two parts of a of a conversation

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,500
at one so that's are using to projector
so we'll see how it turns out

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,260
okay I'm well soul will start I my name
is Paul voters

7
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,729
next to me is all that house back hi I
am

8
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,110
what's what's our background briefly i
some

9
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,440
against her for both for people consider
hikers or

10
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,119
for maybe not him we're involved

11
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,890
we've done a lot with privacy you've
come up with wireless and

12
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,909
and trying to make people safer than
they were all that is involved with

13
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:41,850
Wireless Amsterdam and making mesh
networking in Amsterdam so if you're in

14
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,300
Amsterdam your laptop

15
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,580
it's a good chance that your online
because well dirt's involvement

16
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,729
no

17
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:53,470
I am

18
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,729
for a for a living what I'm doing is

19
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,929
I'm developer for open Swan which is the
eyepiece echoed on Linux

20
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,550
I'm so probably some people if you're
running VPN some Linux thats

21
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:13,550
you're probably running arco and this is
just a hobby

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,460
so I am the

23
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,069
misconception that people have is that
that using encryption is really

24
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,870
difficult and if you look at all these
talks a

25
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,110
i've seen here and in the years before

26
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,330
its feel is very difficult to to get in
corruption

27
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,200
running into really set-ups a lot of
people just given up like well forget it

28
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,790
I'm not going to use it it's just way
too difficult we're gonna show today to

29
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,700
it's not difficult it's very easy and
we're gonna show you how to encrypt your

30
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,130
you are more severe traffic in like no

31
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:48,209
within the hour and that's including all
the things will go wrong doing a

32
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:48,920
presentation

33
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,070
so it's really easy I

34
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:55,130
some some sort of the presentations will
be available on the server

35
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,340
if if any questions later on just catch
either me a holler dial

36
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,900
out in the hallway I'm if your question
becomes too technical

37
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,940
for the stockton we will cut off and
tell you that will happily explain it in

38
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,040
the hallway later as well

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,140
the purpose is also little bit to
convince you that you can actually

40
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,660
make sure that your parents your going
ons little sister also have

41
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,790
security and privacy on the Internet

42
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,070
and that you can do that for them

43
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,180
easy so

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,239
Senate in the next few minutes I will
explain 23 the three concepts you need

45
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:33,980
to know

46
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,829
a little bit of for for encryption to
understand why you need to see so many

47
00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:40,600
windows

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,000
with with fingerprints and weird numbers
I'm I'm going to try and make it really

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,170
keep it really simple

50
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:49,290
but you need to know these these three
basic concepts

51
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,070
and that's all you need to know all all
the rest is the underlying math that

52
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,049
nobody needs to know

53
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,180
so

54
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,720
one point that that's always very
important I'm the network for

55
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,840
definitions very unsafe you should never
trust it that's that's

56
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,510
that's good I am also a lot a lot of
sufferers provide three don't have to

57
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,500
source go to thank you can't really see
if it's worth if it works or not

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,430
I'm the problem is it's been proven the
other way by

59
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,490
from the first vertical wise in Germany
professor in Berlin he is proven that if

60
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,419
you do not have to source code that

61
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:28,599
you can hide information leaking into
any trip talk cooked a graphic channel

62
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,080
so

63
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,260
if you don't have the source code you
can never prove that nobody's

64
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,860
eavesdropping on you and that machine is
not back toward

65
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,360
you can you can never you can ever be
sir so

66
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,950
our focus is on open source and free
tools because those are the ones where

67
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,320
you could actually verified

68
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,140
that's probably working so it's very
important to have a choice between any

69
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,820
any binary only commercial tool or

70
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:57,370
an open source tool go for the open
source tool so this briefly what ru

71
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,680
what we'll be covering first we'll show
you instant message because thats

72
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,289
tends to be the most private
conversations going to most most

73
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:06,430
sensitive data

74
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,919
and its it's the most easy to to
security says we'll talk with internet

75
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,530
browsing

76
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:15,610
to make sure that you know you don't end
up on the screen like the other people

77
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,800
and begin if the stock

78
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,620
we'll talk about email how to secure
that it's a little bit harder

79
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,000
look more work but still doable Voice
over IP will

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,650
my briefly show or not

81
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,939
but

82
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:32,009
you Windows software is currently broken

83
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,050
according to into the website it's
expired

84
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,629
pretty funny the Phils and into itself a
row

85
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm and and will not talk about disk
encryption or VPN zorro wife encryption

86
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,270
if you wanna talk about any of the stand
again

87
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:52,109
catches and always in principle

88
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,500
all all the encryption used in this
offer is is what people call military

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,419
grade which means like it's unbreakable
even by the military

90
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:04,039
even though that's true there's a lot of
other factors that

91
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,050
determine when and how you're secure
enough usally

92
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,180
it comes down to if your machine is own
because you've been browsing to any porn

93
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,740
sites

94
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,629
your machine's not going to be really
securing you can of military-grade

95
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:15,599
encryption

96
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:19,560
but if your old machine is back you know
back door to his key loggers installed

97
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,229
and everything

98
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:23,919
than bill know what you're saying anyway
so

99
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,889
what word where trade is guaranteeing is
that your communications will be encrypt

100
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,550
it and it's up to you to make sure that
your machine is still

101
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,120
trustworthy so does the

102
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,169
the basic threat number one

103
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:44,029
it's the internet all the bad guys again
will we use Allison officer to people

104
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,240
who are trying to communicate as a sort
of standard

105
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,620
I'm you'll see the bad guys in the
Internet and

106
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,229
what people don't always realize is that
in this case and we've

107
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:56,539
done this by encircling boppin read as
well is that

108
00:06:56,539 --> 00:07:01,099
Bob can turn out to be a bad guy to
France's I could be talking to all that

109
00:07:01,099 --> 00:07:03,960
over into message for two years and I
trust him

110
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,099
and during his presentation be run into
a big fight

111
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:10,650
and we hate each other afterwards so
suddenly

112
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:14,259
everything I've told all dirt and if
it's encrypt it

113
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,860
he can sort of proof that I've set this
to all these people you know our

114
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,599
als casa by sort of trust them before
suddenly now becomes not available to

115
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,069
everybody

116
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,009
so if you know it's not always possible
to protect

117
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,800
I'm against a malicious Aliso bop will
see with the instant messenger

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,129
we actually can protect against that and
we do so you can cost up with everybody

119
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,250
very secure and even if you run into
fights later you can deny everything

120
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,560
the second and this is probably the most
important

121
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,630
threat that to you you faces the so
called man in the middle attack

122
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,409
it stems from here Allison Papa talking
I'm so alice is saying hi Bob

123
00:07:55,409 --> 00:08:00,129
and bought here's or not here is he sees
through text

124
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,319
I pop so you got to go out there must be
Alice

125
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,649
that's good I'm however to could be an
evil person

126
00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:11,219
in between the two have damn that's just
relaying the messages so

127
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,080
alice is actually not talking to Paul
palaces talking to Mallory and Papas not

128
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,389
talking to Alice but office talking to
Mallory

129
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:20,500
I'm these arrows

130
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,750
in between signify encrypt it
connections so even though

131
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,990
nobody in the room can you know
eavesdrop between Dallas and Mallory

132
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,019
alice is still talking to the wrong
person so

133
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:37,019
it's very important that once you have
an encrypted connection going

134
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,440
and we know it secure and nobody can he
stop on it we still need to make sure

135
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,229
that we're actually talking to the
person we think we're talking to

136
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,240
the solution for this

137
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,350
as you forget the name it's cool to film
a key exchange

138
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,550
I if you look at the picture what you'll
see is that

139
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,969
when alice is talking to Mallory over an
encrypted connection this a few

140
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,209
properties of that encrypts that
connection

141
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:04,730
it's the signified here with it with a
bunch of letters starting with T nine J

142
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,899
I'm Madhuri is talking to Paul fun

143
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:12,649
and that's another encrypted connection
and that's also has some properties and

144
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,750
again there some numbers to signify that
so

145
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,420
now can see that there's a difference
between one connection between Alice and

146
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:20,740
Bob

147
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,170
and to connections where mailers in
between now the only thing you need to

148
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,300
do is to make sure

149
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,829
that use or somehow convey these
properties have the same cryptic

150
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:29,810
connection

151
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,040
between Alice and Bob so

152
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,240
and that's called a trusted third party
so without using equipped to channel

153
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,329
you I'm to pick up the phone

154
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,920
and you gotta keep up this is the
properties of my connection is that the

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,740
same insurance

156
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,089
and in this case awful go like no no and
mines

157
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,370
really different from what you're saying
order must be wrong and no okay so that

158
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,510
somebody is

159
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,000
listening in on us and if it's for if
it's correct if it's the same letters

160
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,900
stand

161
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,230
they know that there's nobody in the
middle

162
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,220
as anybody the San everybody understand
this concept

163
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:10,350
so so some some people for instance I'm
if they're using Instant Messenger and

164
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,529
if they set up an encrypted connection

165
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,010
think alike all I'm really poll because
I'm wearing glasses and I'm really

166
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,160
skinny so you know it's me

167
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,699
but again matter we can just hear dat
replay that and say oh I am poem skinny

168
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:26,680
and I wear glasses so it's not good
enough to say disinformation

169
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,420
on the encrypted channel you have to do
it somehow some some

170
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,420
and some different way so that's where
the phone call comes in

171
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,360
so i'd artists

172
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,439
in a way a text message is not solving
this

173
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,969
so you should really talk to each other
and hear your each other for shizzle me

174
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,329
sure my questioning who's who and then

175
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:56,660
talk about the properties of
disconnection the yes i'd

176
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:00,290
the implication a preview site was that
you recognize the voice of this other

177
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,199
person if you've never spoken to
disperse in before

178
00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:06,390
who's to say that Mallory is not picking
up the phone and answering your

179
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,980
questions

180
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,390
and then as one-third danger even know
everything could be secure

181
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,630
and nobody's eavesdropping on you or no
policeman and a middling you

182
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,579
somebody could still be capturing
everything you say through encryption

183
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:25,819
and it just have to encrypt the data
there's nothing they can do with it

184
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,939
but at some point you know day comin
matter in

185
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:32,089
palace or pops house and they still the
computer already

186
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,110
the you know copy to secret keys or

187
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,480
or you know third the machine gets
compromised

188
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,750
I'm and then suddenly with the with the
with the information from

189
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:49,120
Alice machine the candy crypt everything
that if he stopped before

190
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,170
defense against at which you might know
from some suffer

191
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,179
I'm is for told the private key that's
actually the valuable thing

192
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,990
that you need to steal from this machine
I'm can be protected by PIN or password

193
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,579
or passphrase

194
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,329
this actually works for you know to
prevent a lil sister from

195
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:10,439
from getting it but you know if the NSA
is you know has this file

196
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:14,110
it will just take them a couple hours to
just got it so

197
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,500
if you if you lose like your p2p private
key don't count on the password

198
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,589
to to make it safe

199
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,160
I'm the second second way where love
protections building is that they use

200
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,819
session keys

201
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,809
I am so that everything you
eavesdroppers and crippled with the

202
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,219
with a temporary key that you throw in
an hour so even though

203
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,250
taken they can sniff a year's worth of
traffic that's encrypt it

204
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,689
not even Allison Bob can t crypto
traffic anymore because they use

205
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:44,929
temporary keys today agreed on with
their real keys

206
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:49,949
soda you know the sniffing that that
traffic is completely useless

207
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:55,179
at school perfect forward secrecy

208
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:58,829
so those the theory so now we're going
back to the

209
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:03,290
back to live demo ing so if anybody has
any questions

210
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:10,290
this would be a good point and you
should work to make fun

211
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,990
questions for still do you have to do
the phone call

212
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,040
for every chance session you because you
have different Lake signatures

213
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,230
show or just once in principle you

214
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,850
you only need to do this once because
then you you verified it is nobody in

215
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,000
between and and with

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,399
you can trust that point on so-called
you think that you can then create new

217
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,750
keys that you trust because you know
nobody's

218
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,290
nobody sees topping on them okay and the
second is the thing

219
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:40,849
you just said in the previous slide if
the if you first

220
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,050
is delicious alright and then use that
established

221
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,470
temporary should leave keys the capture
all the traffic

222
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,079
and the capture like your initial
empirically that

223
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:55,959
figured with the temporary was non you
can figure out what the temp Ricky was

224
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,230
that's completely random

225
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,790
you said of course still as soon as your
computer's compromise his youth

226
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,920
if Alice our computers compromises you
dimitri tell Bob

227
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,959
throw away all the keys you have for me
to compromised

228
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,040
so you have to start from scratch but
your traffic cannot be analyzed

229
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,469
afterwards

230
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,690
for the purposes of your presentation
are you making no distinction between

231
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,870
pgp

232
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:25,240
and GPG no enough

233
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,389
we actually using GPG

234
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:32,160
if your gonna start an instant message
conversation with the phone call

235
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,240
wanna continue the phone call

236
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,740
because later on you might not be in
phone range or its

237
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,060
you need to do a one-time autobahn
verification there's no way around it is

238
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,050
if you skip this you have no way of
knowing that you're not talking to

239
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:47,930
Madhuri ever

240
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,670
to understand is there a better way than
the phone calls or some other third

241
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,370
churchill you go through in have a
suggestion for that

242
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,690
something using the computer only the
phone call is the fastest and most

243
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,160
reliable

244
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,629
that there are other things with let's
not go too much into it but you've got

245
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:05,170
like PCP weapons thrusters

246
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,660
other things where you can sort of you
know make a make a leap of faith and and

247
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,889
and continue from there

248
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:13,819
you can have a business card with
something written on it are many ways of

249
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:15,940
doing this

250
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,680
button normally the easiest way is to
just to a phone call

251
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,060
we try to keep it simple think

252
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,209
so the life part of course occur it

253
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,410
every hacker's conference the network is
well

254
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,709
difficult just like here so

255
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:38,209
we have some screenshots not a fitting
might be life

256
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:43,079
might be say my life or not live at all
bear with us

257
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,389
we'll show the stuff

258
00:15:46,389 --> 00:15:51,560
sort of the the first thing will show
you since it makes you think rich in

259
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,269
but we're using is something called otro
off-the-record

260
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:59,589
which apart from having the properties
that I

261
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:02,759
that I talked about before that is is
encrypting everything and it's making

262
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,170
everything secure

263
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,069
it also ensures that you can always
denied that you've set something

264
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:11,870
I won't go into the details about it for
if you wanna know that cats me later in

265
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,459
the hallway

266
00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:17,310
of the records been implemented in a lot
of suffering now

267
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,800
it's available on our sex via ATM

268
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,779
there's a proxy server that you can use
a i-ten both of which will

269
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:28,529
demonstrating for Windows there's game
for Windows

270
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,620
there's Miranda FEA plugin and there's

271
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,139
trillion there's a trillion plugin just
just together feeling for who's using

272
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:36,639
which

273
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,009
messenger I'm who's who's using ATM

274
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:43,920
a handful who's using iChat

275
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,220
it's less than a team interesting

276
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,329
was using like game for Windows game on
Linux

277
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,810
quite some I'll we will not show
anything limits because

278
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,560
well we tend to this was like a talk for
for for to make it simple in general

279
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,129
people who run Linux really know

280
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,449
everything well but game for Windows
obviously looks the same as game for

281
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,620
Linux so you can just

282
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,669
pick it up from there so anybody using
Miranda

283
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,740
excellent trillion

284
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,789
so futile uses ok it was using Trillian
pro

285
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,158
no actually bothered

286
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:28,159
have security only one who can use the
plugin

287
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,360
for for web browsing

288
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,380
I am we'll be using tor and perfect see

289
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,269
and his works for for every browser on
every

290
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:06,769
operating system for a male

291
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:11,299
who actually be using TPT it's available
on

292
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,950
on all these platforms will show how to
use

293
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,590
Apple's Mail app with

294
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,189
TP gmail and we'll show them the bird
with an egg male

295
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,559
on Windows and again I will work for

296
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,360
for the next as well so these are all
sluts and I will go and try to get the

297
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
demo running

298
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,610
so bear with us while we try to to use
this

299
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:41,610
network

300
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:49,070
so for Celtic the easiest one on OSX
which is ATM

301
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,220
a team comes with with the OT are

302
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,360
completely enabled in it already so it

303
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,060
really just happens everything happens
automatically so I'll try to get on the

304
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,810
wireless here

305
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,899
who

306
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,920
others up with you know our customers
and

307
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,920
cool

308
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,340
buddy from the organization maybe movie
booth the airport in the room

309
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:31,340
it's doing really difficult

310
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,120
okay so I'm on the wire taxpaying so you
can see now that these

311
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,510
above I'm I logged in I'm since

312
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,970
I have a special account called boffo TR
fordice

313
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,320
there's no but as you can see there's
only Alice

314
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,320
you can see is offline

315
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:44,510
its unity when this machine is actually
a Mac running when those

316
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,120
okay America Sollers now all it is
looking in Dallas

317
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,300
in this case arm bopping already locked
in summer just

318
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:07,300
wait and see if these contacts will see
each other so

319
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,870
so what oldest on his only install game
which is a standard

320
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,210
download from SourceForge and he's
downloaded and installed came to show TR

321
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,750
which is the plugin that gets old your
and I we can see that

322
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:27,300
alice looked on so she's appearing in my
buddy list so we have not done anything

323
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,580
like we've you you know talk normally
before without using any encryption and

324
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,030
now

325
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,540
we both have the tools installed we
haven't configured anything

326
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,980
and I will see what happens when older
start a conversation with me

327
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,980
yes

328
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:59,559
so we see older told me something and

329
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:06,559
this is all clear tax anybody sniffing
this would be able to see this

330
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:19,760
so interesting it's not picking up
automatically

331
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,640
so what other didn't do this am which
I'm not sure you can see on screen

332
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,010
but he need sex enable the plugins
apartment stalling the plugin you need

333
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,050
to just select like

334
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:46,050
on on the program which you'll do now

335
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,350
sana size again

336
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,020
it's a good thing because I would have
forgotten to explain to you that you

337
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:09,020
should able to plug in

338
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,920
okay so alice is back this connected

339
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,920
Alice will tell me something

340
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,690
and now we see that my laptop to start
to generate a key so quickly but

341
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:46,690
I'm in we've now

342
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,459
my sis not automatically generated a key
which is the long-term key that will be

343
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,020
using

344
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:01,590
that is not the session key but I'm
still waiting for

345
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:08,590
my screen to say that encryption started
which it did

346
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,160
okay so if it doesn't start
automatically which it shoot but

347
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,800
apparently

348
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,200
game is not sending the right trigger
serious a team it is as this lock symbol

349
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,190
here for I can

350
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:24,990
manually started so that's what I'll do
now I'll say initiate

351
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:31,990
encrypt the dhoti or chat

352
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:07,230
actually lost my wireless now I'm on the
wire

353
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:28,030
there we go

354
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,040
its at the moment generating a key for
my jamie's elation

355
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,200
this is now a little tear

356
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,040
has received an unknown fingerprint from
pope batiste fingerprint

357
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,379
we call each other we verify if this is
to fingerprint

358
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,760
okay so mean like at the end as well so

359
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,750
I think your fingerprints should be. 737

360
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,430
he f6 love line and built with israeli
security and all that it's an

361
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,460
dissident on p6 yeah it does

362
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:06,460
who cool so this is our phone call we
verified it

363
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,200
trying to keep it simple now

364
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,310
we could have started talking without
for every we could've said fair fight

365
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,820
later

366
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,040
and it would still be encrypt it but it
would not be guaranteed that I'm

367
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,540
actually

368
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,480
only talking to all the two could be
this man in the middle still doing it so

369
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
the way this works normally of course
not a few deming

370
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
be for a couple hundred people is that I
am

371
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,169
it will just automatically say initiated
otro talk

372
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,430
you'll just you will switch to encrypt
it and then you can always

373
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:42,300
verified later but the thing is am it
automatically detects when the other and

374
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,380
has an OT are

375
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,350
enabled instant message kind as well so
from this point on everything is encrypt

376
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:48,600
it

377
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,780
I meant since in this case we verified
it there's

378
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:54,899
this nobody who can can he stop on us
from this point on

379
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,980
and

380
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,080
yep it's because enough to spread over
demo so it will show some other clients

381
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,449
I'm

382
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,820
so I'll switch to iChat on the Mac

383
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,820
because some odors question sir it's on

384
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,260
okay just about this session was the key

385
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,310
that you guys verified over the
telephone exchange to electronically

386
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,870
I'm actually am Altair work slightly

387
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,070
different because it's only doing it to
become a key chains per message since

388
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,500
not using public/private keys and
signatures

389
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,030
I can arkansas if you want I can talk to
this later

390
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,210
will but the just the question of the
key that you verified over the telephone

391
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,350
that was exchanged

392
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,950
it was Hooters right between your
message clients

393
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,060
know it was a typical man kicks himself
a lower extremity you i've

394
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,210
I can show you a slight and I'm not
doing now that I can show you that

395
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,560
expensive you know mickey

396
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:54,440
OKC went through third-party in the you
know I'll explain it to you

397
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,740
okay okay but will just answer this
question for me then

398
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,270
um if flaked a you did this is a
corporation that was storing all the

399
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,760
instant message traffic

400
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,980
and later somebody took that analyzed it
they would not be able to get that key

401
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:14,980
right not without you're not
transmitting the key just said

402
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,710
a quick question does the fingerprint
change like say

403
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,220
the fingerprint that popped up the very
fanned phone how often will that change

404
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,940
I in principle for never change unless
you to leave your private key

405
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,460
however and sometimes understood is
actually happens quite a lot of people

406
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,760
use different clients different computer
still lookin from home or from work

407
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,210
so they will have multiple keys and
multiple fingerprints associated with

408
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:41,790
one

409
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,990
instant messaging account so is that
something you'd wanna have fun

410
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,200
like your business card along with your
PGP key year you could pretend you

411
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,280
really have to be careful of lose

412
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:57,740
not losing a key aide its internal
because people use instant messages from

413
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,390
a lot of machines they don't trust you
you tend not to do it to you

414
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:05,330
you don't put that my it's not like a
p2p cue that you'll use for five years

415
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,889
people tend to sort of quickly go
through these kind of

416
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,410
keys and just one last one

417
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,160
how is it a lot more secure than secure
I am its built-in

418
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,160
secure I am is not secure ok etc how
secure would it be if

419
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,080
both view in so doing it this way both
used

420
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,340
poor to connect between you and him so
that's where are you ok

421
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,560
you've just postponed a problem where I
need to verified it or connection

422
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,570
like at some point I will need to do
this verification somehow

423
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:40,810
because it makes it more difficult
because they're

424
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,840
they have roaming Park you know I mean
that have to either

425
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,470
be he between your local machine

426
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,110
and arm the first war know that you can
act to

427
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,990
which means you know that that's being
done like on your local machine so even

428
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,880
if it's in cryptid within your local
networks even if they weren't

429
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,140
but if I'm sitting at Starbucks not
really gonna help me

430
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,170
so it still Wireless nobody can still
see the first top

431
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:10,190
you should never to never trust a
network always check out advances no

432
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,340
does nothing around this miss know where
others

433
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,440
you must do not have an check on their
your key

434
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,790
and and also this doesn't are the
problem I love

435
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:23,560
in yeah this is great for if you know
this is

436
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,850
aim have you know if your actually
talking to somebody in trying to encrypt

437
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,260
arm your connection this is great and
it's nice and secure but aim also has

438
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,429
this nasty problem with Buddy images

439
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:36,800
where it does a direct connection and so
it you know

440
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,590
it gives the whoever you're you're
talking to your IP address so somebody

441
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,650
I am too cold they have your IP

442
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,740
so sir but if you don't use direct aim
then yet another issue

443
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:53,340
I it doesn't really matter who sees the
traffic right because it's all in

444
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,860
cricket

445
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,740
so it shouldn't really matter this
actually from an entirely different

446
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,429
things

447
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:03,800
really in the persian brother anyway but
you

448
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,070
okay so I'll switch to I set and and
demonstrate that

449
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:12,310
iight at I'm is from Apple's provider
software we can't really who can our own

450
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:15,490
our own things easily so instead of what
we've

451
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,700
we've done there's a program called
Altair proxy

452
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:24,750
which basically the puts all the
functionality in its proxy program

453
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:28,290
so does the the output of the proxy

454
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:35,290
and I'll start iChat now should close
him

455
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:50,420
I would say this a bit more difficult
for your parents at home but if you

456
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,460
should do for them

457
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,680
you can teach them to use this you know
easily

458
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,490
its easy to use them email I guess so

459
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:03,750
to still try it it's a bit more
difficult than with game

460
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:08,670
still Althea proxies getting more and
more better you know we need some more

461
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,130
time to build a koi

462
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:13,810
invaded everybody really understands it
right of two books but it's really

463
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,190
difficult because everybody is a
different understanding what a good

464
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,940
quise

465
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,530
so we need him common ground there first
before we can

466
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:24,670
be built east ok

467
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,950
okay so I've started out at I'm this is
just the standard iChat

468
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:33,070
nothing is installed no no encryption
the Altair proxies been started

469
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,139
and now do anything to do with it. say
we should be using a proxy so go to

470
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:37,900
preferences

471
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,740
and of have a look where

472
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,300
02 server settings

473
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,920
and our for about that you have to be
offline before you can change anything

474
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,520
so

475
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:57,270
I will go offline now i can say clinic
connect using proxy

476
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,960
local host and port 8080 using HTTP I'm

477
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,590
it also supports socks5 an HTTPS the
proxy

478
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,420
forces me I chose very buggy so it
doesn't actually work with it so you

479
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,980
have to use HTTP proxy

480
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:16,980
so once we've done that I can go back
online and I will go online

481
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:24,370
the the hotel proxy that's running on my
machine

482
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:37,120
excellent could not connect to the name
server: I'll try this again

483
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,690
try to reconnect with our personal use
the proxy cell

484
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,250
okay America Sonam online again with aim

485
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,150
and

486
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,700
I can see Alice so that's talked to
Alice

487
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:16,700
will see two things happening

488
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,058
to see her to in the Otero screen the
the the proxy

489
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:29,819
start it but not seeing private
collection yet

490
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:36,819
say something back

491
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,460
okay missing out at Hotel proxies
generating the key so this is a new key

492
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,690
has no relationship to the the other

493
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,730
even or using the same account so we
have to go through this again

494
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,180
held I don't remember ball

495
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:03,060
that's true well but if it is zero
though you're Europe

496
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,880
okay so the fingerprints of a three for
69 CTA

497
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,090
above finance with the D no

498
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:18,610
ok and it's yours

499
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,040
mine starts with the same it seems

500
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:29,040
you know it's the same

501
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,290
so you saying we've been manhandled I
would be cool

502
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:48,290
this a common States so obviously we
should not trust this

503
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,480
I

504
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:17,970
I'm bop part that's me is received and
fingerprint from outta so you're the

505
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:18,630
turkey

506
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:25,630
can you reach your key alert

507
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:44,309
okay so if you if you right click on the
Otero button in game you can get this

508
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:46,940
many if you do there for fingerprint you
actually see your key

509
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,010
and the other person's key sonar fast
collared

510
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,130
I all that I think he is 3-for-6 9ct

511
00:36:53,130 --> 00:37:00,130
the dance with DD yes it is cool

512
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:08,160
the session ID you see here is also you
can also verified by the session at the

513
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,830
end and

514
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:12,279
because the saudis property serv tinker
to channel a talk with earlier

515
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,290
if you fair fight is that automatically
means that you've also fair fight to

516
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:15,640
keep

517
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:21,490
because there's no person in the middle
so now we

518
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:25,380
now we face now we've accomplish the
same thing with with iChat without

519
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,220
actually having

520
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,760
known a different caption capabilities
and iChat it's all done by the altar

521
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,470
proxy here

522
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:36,050
so again from here on for a complete
equity

523
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:42,590
so any questions on

524
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,850
instant message encryption you can

525
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,190
you can force the encryption settings
after you've done this once

526
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:52,369
you will notice that the first message
was sent was plain text

527
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:56,490
because that trigger COTR plugin to
recognize that it can do cryptography

528
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:00,820
I'm once you've done this you can you
can change your body setting to be

529
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:06,090
always always encrypt so that you never
send out a single plane tax

530
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,320
packets can be all that can demonstrate
that on on

531
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,580
game if Israel ago does a DP

532
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,270
to default settings and then you contain
two developments require

533
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,840
private messaging so now I could never
talk to mana crypt at all

534
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:28,840
if I condemn it is by turning off to
proxy in an axial

535
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,700
go offline first

536
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:38,580
I'll

537
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:44,029
disable the proxy go back online

538
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,760
lines

539
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,760
well terminator proxies and some not
using it connecting connecting

540
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,480
how do I only have 15 minutes left which
race

541
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,110
sign up

542
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,180
again if I say something it will be in
plain text

543
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:17,450
but

544
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:20,690
all that cannot prevent that because I'm
just sending a message he can prevent me

545
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:22,150
from sending paying tax however

546
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,170
if he now type something he should not
be able to and he should be blocked from

547
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:32,140
typing it

548
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,920
its okay so so what happen here it's
it's good to see what happened here said

549
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,190
older did not know that I reconnected
and disabled my 0 TR

550
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:41,910
so is this something mean a cryptic
message because he doesn't know any

551
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:46,449
better than that you know we're still
talking cryptic so despite a call like

552
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:47,469
no

553
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:50,789
and he should

554
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:56,569
and his is private connection you can do
that with your tire buttons are you go

555
00:39:56,569 --> 00:40:03,119
right click and private conversation and
I what we see is that

556
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,249
immediately tries to initiate otro and
in this case I could help pulling saying

557
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:10,180
oh you should download

558
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:17,180
your hair solid will still receive plain
text messages but you can't send them

559
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,430
because he is configured as kind to only
send encrypted okay

560
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,459
all race through our next step because
we only have

561
00:40:26,459 --> 00:40:30,259
10 minutes even that's cheating my
laptop says I 15 minutes

562
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:35,430
months to 17 okay

563
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,618
so I will quickly show how to encrypt
your browser

564
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:45,619
you're passing traffic involves
installing poor

565
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,670
which is a package which have already
installed here I think most people note

566
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,449
or by now

567
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:58,180
I'm people do you store please don't use
it

568
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,448
for torrents don't Donald overt or

569
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:04,509
that's just plain stupid they will see
you are pete was anyway

570
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:08,579
what what you do is in Firefox you go to
extension to

571
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:11,699
get an extension and in this case

572
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:18,699
I have extension on file

573
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,819
torrent is basically a way of shielding
yourself

574
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,450
from the other but party basically to
website to know who you are

575
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:34,500
I think most people know that by now
a.m. it's very convenient way

576
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:38,440
it's a bit slow because the network is
you know overburdened by people trying

577
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,450
to actually download

578
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,710
I sold over it which is most stupid but

579
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,819
a.m. you can still use it if you wanna
register your

580
00:41:46,819 --> 00:41:49,970
account without anybody knowing about it
or

581
00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:53,410
you want them faces a website states
your government

582
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,140
maybe not appreciate I'm

583
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,450
about who briefly switch because you've
already installed the plugin

584
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,940
I i cannot get enough link actually
going cycle next week not go through

585
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,609
your window

586
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:08,250
so to switch to mark the screen to the
show the

587
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:15,250
plugin

588
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,510
does it work

589
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,320
you notice no welcome to Windows XP

590
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,750
under Mac OS okay so all it will start
Firefox

591
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,980
and he is done to get extensions and
he's gotten the

592
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,990
what was the name again if your gonna
shielded installation the situation is

593
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,160
really like you press the Next button
five times you go to

594
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,529
toroto tf2 torque you download it its
incredibly easy to install

595
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:53,040
just install its UV which a computer
everything set up

596
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,350
formal different OS's it's sold if

597
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:00,020
EC and then you find extension call to
our apartment which

598
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,650
have here but i can text the public like
it but I won't start up in Firefox

599
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:07,480
so all it has done that he's he's
already included

600
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,210
the talk about an extension and restart
his brows and annuals

601
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,119
notice at the top so at the bottom right
you'll see

602
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,800
it says or disengaged is

603
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,800
disabled

604
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,990
she def some so now you see it or
disabled

605
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,640
and am so if he goes to I P dot
excellent site com

606
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,759
the network is dead slow I cannot
connect to anything

607
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,910
I can only show you how to twerk so
basically

608
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,160
IFE he stole this little but in here

609
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,730
or default in your browser over here
stand it is disables

610
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,790
you go to a website like an IP checker
like

611
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:03,550
I what's my IP dot com you will see but
if you can

612
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:09,000
first have it is able to if your own a
diesel I know whatever cable IP address

613
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,850
moment you start enabling it you refresh
your page for what's my RP do

614
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:16,670
i bristle cone she did you have a
different IP two ish

615
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:22,220
using tortoise the way how to verify it
veterans basically out of the box

616
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,230
but cannot see it

617
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,450
show you it right now because the
network a sweetie too slow

618
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:34,430
for yep

619
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:39,859
sense for

620
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:46,860
weary cancer things like an email so
nothing we can show a life

621
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,700
which is to encrypt your vocals I'm this
is gizmo

622
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,440
I miss a free client available in OS X
and Windows

623
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:01,770
and the Nexus well I'm it's a SIP client

624
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,660
subsist on a protocol to focus I'm
there's a tool called

625
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:10,299
that phone I what this does is

626
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:14,840
its I'm capturing all the sit back its
and encrypting them

627
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:19,150
what happens if course I can't I have
the same problem I can't really connect

628
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:19,950
to anything

629
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,580
since i connect this window will show in
secure

630
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,240
if i dont start a vocal with anybody I

631
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,960
it will show in securing I can go to
click secure if the other and France et

632
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,820
phone as well

633
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,150
I'm these there will be two numbers
appearing here

634
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,590
in the in the boxes which are the the
diffie-hellman key numbers

635
00:45:39,590 --> 00:45:42,980
which is the fingerprint of the key so
we

636
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,120
since this is a VoIP call and we know
each other's voice actually don't have

637
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,730
to pick up another phone we just use the
same connection

638
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:52,980
and we say hi the numbers I'm hearing is
blah blah blah blah blah

639
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,320
and since I know all its voice I can
trust that

640
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,400
you know Mallory stop you know repeating
different numbers using all its voice

641
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,870
I'm and then 13 want to verify these
numbers for safe to go we can talk and

642
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,460
we know that nobody's listening in on
our

643
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,130
VoiceCon calls artist does not work with
Skype because Skype is doing

644
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:16,310
evil things to hide everything it can
from the network so it's not possible to

645
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,160
use for Skype

646
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,640
so that's for it I am

647
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,040
and and the last thing on our list was
encryption with

648
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,700
Thunderbird for email but I think we
will you have time for that

649
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,860
and that's all it can do this in two
seconds okay

650
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:38,860
and I love others in two seconds

651
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:46,450
so tune a British a wonderful tool
because they make all these extensions

652
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:50,730
and we have this great people the bill
to aging male extension do know people

653
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,230
about it

654
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,859
it is a is to possibility to tie pgp

655
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:58,759
into your tender burt it if you just
install them

656
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,069
you go to the website extension website
often avert you stole it

657
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,270
basically you get an extra menu this one

658
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:09,359
yes to think about it did you also need

659
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:14,190
GPG show you have to go to the GPG which
are and also download GPG

660
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,130
installed at saw all the books again
next next next next next

661
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:23,270
you're done a naked male

662
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:27,710
that's the extension and TPG now

663
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,510
sorry my action and my four ish it's
killing me so

664
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:38,510
for those %uh for Mac if you look at the
smaller project I'm just insulin TP

665
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:39,509
gmail

666
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:42,869
on mil-dot happen level officials of the
same things

667
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:49,869
talking too much

668
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:54,420
so basically the only thing you need to
do is after you installed

669
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:57,800
teubert the enigma extension and TPG

670
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,980
is to create a key soda cue

671
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,320
you know if something were you can
create your messages with or you can

672
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,430
have all the people and create a mystery
to chat to you

673
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:13,319
so you have key management weighed only
thing you should do is

674
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:20,320
say I want a new key

675
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,250
past race which is needed to reach to
protect Turkey should of people cannot

676
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:38,250
actually start using it even if I'm
turkey just takes a little while

677
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:44,990
but basically two main thing is the
moment you have GPG

678
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:49,060
and Yuki you can start in creating your
email started people in the other way

679
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,029
around because it

680
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,190
you can dock everything that you need
like to download keys from key servers

681
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:58,720
is all in bed already an extension so
all the stuff that you used to do on the

682
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,560
command promt

683
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:03,990
you're always it's not something that's
all tied into week we

684
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:10,990
its pretty awesome

685
00:49:25,019 --> 00:49:28,669
feel you know how to send in email
encryption exactly because the Wallace

686
00:49:28,669 --> 00:49:33,709
is on really not working for me but
first meet you have all kinds of

687
00:49:33,709 --> 00:49:34,289
Britain's

688
00:49:34,289 --> 00:49:40,519
I could show you a little bit we're
happy to show this later on if there are

689
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,959
spots where we can have network access
so it just

690
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:49,869
crafts from the hallway and will show
how easy it is just

691
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:53,359
just a little bit in here opened you BG
if you just say encrypt

692
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:57,299
in press OK you have to but you have to
key

693
00:49:57,299 --> 00:50:00,409
of bob already on your machine in your
keychain

694
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:05,179
key management utility organic meal you
can start sending encrypted emails

695
00:50:05,179 --> 00:50:09,569
and receiving them at the same time so
it's regional difficult that you need to

696
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:12,729
install and configure all kinds of
difficult things with cum on lines

697
00:50:12,729 --> 00:50:15,679
Israel alcoholic we click click click
click click

698
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,519
you're there BBC and I vote

699
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:28,519
if you have a question what happened
what happens when you get your mail a

700
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:31,119
different machines

701
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,189
UK key on this machine for example let's
say

702
00:50:34,189 --> 00:50:38,888
that's your office machine your home
machine your mail in general is

703
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:43,159
from all over the place well I guess
that you know your personal and create a

704
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:45,269
gmail something you don't wanna read at
work

705
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:48,809
because to machine at work is from you
you know the business at work

706
00:50:48,809 --> 00:50:51,869
you don't want them to own anything its

707
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:55,529
really private and personal to you so I
would recommend to

708
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:59,569
actually start the second email address
that you use only at home

709
00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:03,709
and another address maybe where people
so that people know okay want to send

710
00:51:03,709 --> 00:51:04,659
you something created

711
00:51:04,659 --> 00:51:08,149
in the senate to the second email
address if destruction to Asian

712
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:12,009
for me I carry my little around it is my
office that is my home

713
00:51:12,009 --> 00:51:15,309

714
00:51:15,309 --> 00:51:18,729
iraq from this little so from ETag

715
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:21,769

717
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:31,309

00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:34,789
if you tourists to if you trust all
three computers to you keep them all up

719
00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:36,149
to date with all the softer

720
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:39,799
other you to systolic is in all three of
them then you copy keys

721
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:43,799
yet you can export and import

722
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:47,769
export-import its it's just like you
know you know how to transfer your

723
00:51:47,769 --> 00:51:49,630
bookmarks from one computer the other
one

724
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,939
this is just like that it's really easy
on screen now you can see it is I

725
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:54,788

that

729
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:09,619
next time when you hear pgp for the
configuration

730
00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:13,770
you can configure everything as well we
really have to stop now

731
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:17,630
but will take these two questions and I
will stop a question about the

732
00:52:17,630 --> 00:52:21,910
browsing encryption abused or or
something want your ISP still have

733
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:25,920
records very thing Oryza encrypt it to
them to

734
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,160
you getting crypt it's a great you also
doing

735
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,319
you starting creeps into the first node
and then you goes with it or network

736
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,430
the ice please also Christians believe
you when you first

737
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:39,240
torn alt and after that they don't know
but yeah

738
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,290
use this perfect forward

739
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:46,680
security secrecy that named in the chat
we ought to delete

740
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,280
would you have to remove sorry you don't
understand perfect forward secrecy

741
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,560
it ages ago how to use it the chart that
you showed were how do you make sure

742
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,210
people can

743
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:59,680
like who with the check prices actually
it it generates in new key for every

744
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,890
message and it leaks part of two key so
that people can force messages in the

745
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:04,450
past

746
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:07,540
I'm so every message actually has a new
key

747
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,650
I'm so that it doesn't use a session key

748
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:14,100
like like like for instance I p sac or
SSH does

749
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,400
I can explain to you and all and

750
