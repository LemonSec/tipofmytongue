1
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:26,619
are ever gonna get started just a couple
a quick announcements

2
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:30,289
all of these panels are being recorded
and burned to DVD

3
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,040
you can buy them for ten dollars shortly
after

4
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,750
the %ah panel right back with a t-shirt
the twenty six hundred years been so on

5
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,970
I highly recommend you pick one up so we
break even

6
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:48,440
am on that note these conferences

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,149
are a very positive 5

8
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:55,290
om but they're always one or two people

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,750
that try to make it on positive

10
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,109
if you see in the body doing something
that they shouldn't be

11
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,440
please find our security or I

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,950
number two type person I because they're

13
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,880
are folks that seem to enjoy coming to
these events just so they can steal

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,949
laptops & ham radios and things like
that and that's definitely not what this

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,080
community is about

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,399
so to the other 99 percent you thank you
and the one percent you suck

17
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:29,399
and this is a citizen

18
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,720
engineer consumer electronics attacking
an open source software

19
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,240
with Philip terone who is number 106
very proud of his number

20
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,240
calm and Lady A to who is number eighty
right

21
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,329
yep system engineer we're gonna see how
to get A's are so you see people doing

22
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,079
bad things

23
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,520
you can shock them how the

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,250
five dollars yeah made

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,250
I so awful to a senior editor magazine
you guys see make time

26
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,200
resize image down vendor area later
hopefully we can read

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,769
youngest I guess in a way to kidding and

28
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:19,799
passing work with 2600 on free Kevin
stuff

29
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:23,769
acted site collection have a lot of
things

30
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,109
people bill their basements homes in and

31
00:02:27,109 --> 00:02:32,190
I'm levy I'm a currently R&D fell on IBM
which is a

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,410
new media gallery actually York now

33
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,448
and I basically feed Google by making
on-time

34
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,549
project something online you know that
on the open source

35
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,630
kit so people build them so anything
that I present you that you like you can

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,138
get full documentation

37
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:50,570
on lady did not match or you can buy
some kids if

38
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:54,500
dot com so I can also already in its

39
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,880
so citizen engineered benefits are

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,359
gets tossed around a little bit think
open source hardware might be

41
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,979
a new term for a lot of I mean everyone
saw

42
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:08,690
Open Source offers and the benefits and
how it's start

43
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,130
and people started building things on
top of things

44
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,130
sharing citizen is there's a little bit
different and what I like to do

45
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,120
carry around a slide present conferences
and

46
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,260
like lately representing like getting
hard I care on the sides kinda look back

47
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,810
history when everyone had build stuff

48
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,829
wasn't distribution there wasn't the
type things you can just like or

49
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:34,260
something

50
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,630
you had a TV or radio or car kinda had

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,880
so I clicked diesel covers this is up
from Popular Mechanics 1961

52
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,549
how to build the safe side work hard for
your kids that's really insane actually

53
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:46,979
it's a

54
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:50,199
yeah so that's %uh lead acid batteries

55
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:55,009
little teeny like that big problem

56
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:58,650
yeah %uh scientists on the brink hell
that's still true and

57
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,269
makes reference circuit board but not
this is

58
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,400
type things least other the plans were
shared these magazines

59
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,570
public act Science Monitor the most
popular magazines for a really long time

60
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,930
millions million copies everyone red
like things

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,720
change a lot now at people magazine
think that this is a good

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,690
stitches think other airline def talk
doing it and if you look really

63
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,900
generally I have like guys like like
everyone's happy holiday

64
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,580
this is this might be a good way to
fight

65
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,650
like future tears subject I

66
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,660
sick a size our site of complete plans

67
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,810
I just a job rewire house on

68
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,850
make we have a lot of projects like
where like I don't have school last

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,290
forever

70
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,280
we show people on a wire stuff like
everyone's are you worried about getting

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,700
sued

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,250
on know hopefully like one day maybe
something up

73
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,010
you can refer back to sale while
actually do things like

74
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,680
criminals be

75
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,050
the lie detector the good

76
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,210
this is my favorite line that I love
Sarah

77
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,739
the motor less clutter copper you can
build yourself and tell what your car

78
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,570
in

79
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,630
like that's a you know it to me the
other way that is that like

80
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,969
this is such a bad idea a

81
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,480
people actually used to build these like
this is we had

82
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,290
different type maginnis we're going to
the moon ever just space race going on

83
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,110
this is what we wanted to build a from
Seattle

84
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,970
we still have got a monorail said it's
kind of a letdown the things like how to

85
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,500
revive

86
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,580
picture what to do when your furnace
quite like this is what people

87
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,669
thought technology met what can you do
over millions of copies

88
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,790
this issue proud other

89
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,940
drug drugs are open for thirty-five
dollars the fun are you prolly her to

90
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,930
the case that the garage door opener
company stopping people from making

91
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,020
their own garage door openers is that
the code for copyright its

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,719
what 1963

93
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,750
life this is the the world's safest cars

94
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,480
just because nobody I think in israel
now

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:10,300
safe there and talk about another
Tripoli project later

96
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,250
here to free blueprints for traveling
traveling like their

97
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,580
losses ready to happen any nation

98
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,460
but up least things free parking ticket
for ten dollars

99
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,930
emits light projectors backer plan an
awesome

100
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,850
about stumbling in six basic steps a

101
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,540
you can build this Rhomobile I could
take it down this

102
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,630
crazy this invention ever mechanics shop

103
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:40,300
kinks the Scott thing stinks radio
thanks

104
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:47,300
a major one man sup maybe

105
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,580
and I this is that this is a good when
you can make a lil radio

106
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,599
see can listen to I radio y fly
airplanes

107
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,630
now you really can't and a geiger

108
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:04,090
on its the elementary you some other
books like like the point can act 700

109
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,960
things for boys do

110
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,850
there's like a really popular thing i'd
the this is a really good luck

111
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,220
there was a time where all the chemical
formulas for like coca-cola

112
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,140
anything that defying a curfew the have
just this documentation

113
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,880
actually make it yourself itself I like
copies of this book in our

114
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,400
bit torrent is a wonderful place to find
he's really a box right now

115
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,210
foxfire but users there's a lotta Center

116
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,810
to do copywriter not really a log cabin
building

117
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:38,190
a snake floor faith healing shine like a
lot of people just below the surface the

118
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,280
foxfire book series

119
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,700
had it or got arts and crafts things to
me

120
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,120
we have the dark times much exactly sure
thing

121
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,289
after world war two there is a lot of
mass production

122
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,490
us certainly electronics from other
countries but

123
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,550
in the eighties and nineties like
everyone stop buying stuff for a while

124
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,130
really hurt think everything that we
started the nation as the Packers

125
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,390
like benjamin Franklin was thinker

126
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,979
money so this arson

127
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,599
dark times and but things started to
change now specially

128
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,419
you look at criminal sessions here it
looks like things that are in the

129
00:08:19,419 --> 00:08:20,210
physical world

130
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,650
are starting to come the code

131
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,830
you can use this stuff Megan and by that
I mean if you look at like the AM radio

132
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,010
skydiving example you built this but the
the actual pieces inside if it were that

133
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,080
code that ran on

134
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,810
there's other examples out there and I
think one of the things that happen

135
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,240
30 television player

136
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,970
but the AM radio really need example
everyone don't want everyone happy

137
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,300
everyone did something with his big
cabinets around everyone shared

138
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,540
some way and we have something happening
right now there's little pieces of

139
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,060
evidence

140
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:56,030
that things are are changing and the mp3
players a good example

141
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,339
how many people have like an mp3 player
like absolutely so it's kinda like

142
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:03,540
in although you didn't build it is kind
of like a transistor radio

143
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,900
is just something up certainly see all
sorts of weird project this is %ah

144
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,990
the peasant every player this guy
actually worked with

145
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,450
has and decided to build his own mp3
player

146
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,910
and it's a as mp3 player license without
dying selling get it online

147
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,060
the document at the whole process he
tried to open source parts of the body

148
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,550
you could %uh this is the mp3 card this
is a nine dollar

149
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,930
players actually lesson like five
dollars now and you can

150
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,430
put it into other projects so it's
almost cheap others my i pod collection

151
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,900
I was doing some iPod firmware

152
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,829
Seth all while ago these are some weird
accessories and these are you know

153
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:39,790
people putting Linux on

154
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,490
iPods in each generation gets better the
type of things you can do

155
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,600
so that the actual hardware itself is
interesting buddy type things that

156
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,410
people are doing

157
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,770
on top of it are even more interesting
one example as I wanted to audio

158
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,510
recordings

159
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,400
and so I put iPod when exxon my ipod and
I was able to run around

160
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,439
high quality audio recording the
hardware was disabled

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,870
shipping by Publix on their and your

162
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,790
higher-quality recording and they can
also record of

163
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,540
up people started to play around the
graphics so this is

164
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,770
the born do not connect looking thing
and I use projects like this to get kind

165
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:14,829
of the younger kids

166
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:18,510
into electronics different pieces
technology as

167
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,750
the really don't know how did build
stuff that's not something that's

168
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,959
taught maybe there's a there's a few
examples

169
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,199
get better doing something with
electronics but

170
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,320
everyone wants to something custom they
want to customize it

171
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,949
my something it's more and so we
released but how to use

172
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,699
I A how to how to come I am

173
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,990
and on mississippi Stud every single
slide you see here has a how-to behind

174
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:47,190
and we're giving wealthy such as at the
end of the presentation I'll give you

175
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,949
that way to download all the stuff you
watching your firmware

176
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,370
these things on the such as letter thats
a

177
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,370
no other things that inventors TV Guide
is here

178
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,470
there's a presentation tomorrow about
subversive technologies and that there's

179
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,660
a ton of fun project that too I reported
this

180
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,680
I R sound that came from the TV Guide
and then I put my i-pod

181
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,949
and I have a sound I R converter that
lives possibly so that I'd walk from

182
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:10,870
Best Buy

183
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,320
or

184
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,280
or our site or maybe some I and

185
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,720
like CES is a good place to get it is I
TV's just loops and turns off all

186
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,230
a even the boxes so lot wanna status
there are others

187
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,890
there's eight million iPods like the
first year now there's a million iPods a

188
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,449
quarter

189
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,620
and like no one talks about these boxes
are even

190
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,020
like what are people doing this sign in
an iPod boxer about so with all that

191
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,150
distorted iPods

192
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:38,020
you can make your own little robot up

193
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,520
another fun thing that happened was I as
technologies retire

194
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,069
reuses theme and this this is a I the
Walkman iPod case

195
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,230
up funny story behind us Sony said this
guy

196
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,380
I think they sent a cease-and-desist
because they said you know your you're

197
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,030
really a

198
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,790
confusing everyone a we don't want
people to think we make crappy

199
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:03,209
players that are really big that no one
buys sony makes crappy players

200
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,930
buys up so the way around this is week
there's a how-to

201
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,090
so you can post out is just can't sell
these as price anymore

202
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,450
just a fun one you know the its good
project is up

203
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,080
old mice like everyone has liked or
falls my eyes

204
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,160
what do you do it is well this is a a
and I'd be a mouse

205
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,400
FM transmitter cell shuffle fuckin

206
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,520
other creative things that are happening

207
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:34,220
charging solutions this is what does
handprint flashlights you can charge

208
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,440
and that was round once okay let's get
to it

209
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,560
but let's show how to modify the
existing PC technology with the crowd

210
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,150
and then charge iPod but wait there's
more I'll will put on a bike

211
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:49,420
so now the guy petals are out recharges
as I fight again

212
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,840
every everything's documented and
there's a lot to me improvements on this

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,090
on this 1i had it takes forever though
like for it takes like 40 days

214
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,850
but if if if our world

215
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,860
political problems continue I'll have
liked the last week

216
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,190
up and

217
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,050
even things that are quite meant it to
be tinkered with

218
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,530
right away so the iTrip is FM
transmitter and

219
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:19,140
won the 1st battalion Irish the Rangers
better so we

220
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,189
how to how to crack it open just require
lawn $10 you get more range a fun things

221
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,870
you can do if you go to a gym where they

222
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,350
broadcast TV's

223
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,190
over FM so people can list their I went
to one there's like Fox News I decided

224
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,530
to display my own stuff

225
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,620
or you can go the other way

226
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,030
and this is a megaphone helmet at and

227
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:48,370
you can plug in your iPod just I walk
around

228
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,840
for a music player %uh

229
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,900
so what's going on here with all the
stuff why is actually happening

230
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,090
this is an unfortunate slide this is all
these are all these crazy web 2.0

231
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,920
companies there

232
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,510
XML and RSS and like all these like
everything ends with are

233
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,890
or it's like some weird name in we all
these companies agreed on next year

234
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,260
but the good news is a a lot of the
things that they're doing are helping

235
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,540
sharing information without

236
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,380
wiki got Flickr up workers actually one
of the most interesting places

237
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,760
to share how to use right now and it's
only because it's like

238
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,790
the way it's bill we have new devices
there

239
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,180
are super easy access to documentation
the way that

240
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,570
things get sent out there like right
away there's wanna recipe

241
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,180
is interesting and people know about it
we all probably saw the mentors and Diet

242
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:35,560
Coke

243
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,480
things like every so here's a fun house
you guys take diet coke

244
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,070
but I think I meant isn't it and
explodes day easy

245
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:47,080
are medicide to do a contest about coke
diet coke

246
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,390
decided it was freakin they're scared
meant just look the other way and the

247
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,640
like no sinister videos

248
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,250
so you know that instantly went up on
YouTube is only one around the web so

249
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,500
it's getting into there's things that
are happening I

250
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,710
and yes I have to ship so much stuff
like we have so many cell phones this

251
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,470
is this is an artist who takes photos
have cell phones people tossing

252
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,720
recycling everything but what can you do
with assault are really

253
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,210
thats crazy up and we're getting mad one
of the things that happens

254
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,800
us consumers customers everyone column
are starting to fight back

255
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,570
what's been going on there the web
recently you know a while phone calls so

256
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,670
trying to cancel their accounts

257
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,800
there's a site devoted to custer people
not happy with

258
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,840
whereby things we started this thing of
you can open something

259
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,400
you don't know it now

260
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,580
his alright started like sending this to
companies like I just sent this randomly

261
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,820
like so like they don't really respond
but

262
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,330
like hear something so special tools
like why do I need to buy special told

263
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,200
Open Mic thing like

264
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,310
okay like maybe once in a while it'll
make sense but don't don't just make a

265
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,810
special tool that have to buy

266
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,520
I want to open up something turks okay
but like don't ever do tamper-proof

267
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,710
up some things like if something can be
replaced make everyplace like

268
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,470
you know the power doubt our things are
going always go on laptops on

269
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,900
laptop power supplies would be great if
they all work the same how many times

270
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,950
have you keep by

271
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,440
by said different ones for different
laptops power from USB

272
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,780
why isn't everything anything is
rechargeable USB

273
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,189
standard connectors on the first snap
site itself open

274
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,960
screws are better than cialis up docks
and drivers like every company please

275
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,660
pick stuff on archived or

276
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,439
like if its drivers company all things
out we just can't find drivers

277
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,060
useless documentation their stores
surges free now

278
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,050
get it out there a met a person or not
of like schematics like

279
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,300
right now what we're doing make it any
type kidding

280
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,010
bill where clinton's the stuff same
thing

281
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,730
abolished and that finally see the
return ticket

282
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,670
things things that are happening right
now because access to all sorts of

283
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,530
different stuff because

284
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,949
there's online stores because
international shipping there's some

285
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:00,660
kids that we're starting to see that
mourner available before

286
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,359
so this one it's that paper itself sorry
a plastic cup reporter

287
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,310
so you can record your own voice until
possibly up just like record player

288
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,040
is an of us are you tubes

289
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,119
RFID there's tons of our there's an RFID
session earlier

290
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,120
many things about that sheep easy to get
so we start releasing

291
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,150
projects okay so are fighting you know
everyone else as other

292
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:26,830
what can we do well here's a simple
project how to make door opener so you

293
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,550
can just wait RFID bad

294
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,560
again but of course what did people the
right way they decide

295
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,270
pinar ID attack in their hands said just
like you'd expect

296
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,040
so here's a project that you put the
reader inside a keyboard

297
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,550
and as you go up to the keyboard you
know i unlock your password

298
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,180
so you don't even need to login anyways
and for believing

299
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,050
you of and you've got other

300
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,450
house yeah yesterday all servers and
you've got other problems

301
00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,320
up and then of course what do you do
once you have an RFID implant we make a

302
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,070
trampoline

303
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,500
that can only be activated with your
hand and when you jump on it she flames

304
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,730
so this is the an RFID enabled flames
shooting traveling

305
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,730
course like 10 seconds and this is
everything there's that would probably

306
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,680
be on what it is all magazines Asian
like

307
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,970
white I would you feel the thing I fun
stuff %uh

308
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,520
it you know what are the themes and
images fours like when she started

309
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,920
great stuff and and mod it like I have a
digital camera that's really all that's

310
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,580
really crappy

311
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,669
but I soldered in a new chip that makes
take photos

312
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,690
like a second charge teaching first I
like digital camera better digital

313
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,120
camera

314
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,820
because I made it something next each is
another example like these are really

315
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,129
this all russian hardware and they were
used for all sorts the scientific

316
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,600
all sorts like hardcore/style and now
they're just all over the place

317
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,160
and you can't buy them go on eBay he has
RSS feed

318
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,870
just like puttin 8255 eventually but
people making Fox

319
00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:00,000
wristwatches all sorts things %uh

320
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,590
what are the other things that happen is
a candy

321
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,090
and also its of a sudden kept seeing all
these projects

322
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,780
two people he's met like wow this is
nice cases you do something so people

323
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,210
take their own house and they decide to
make an outside

324
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,050
10 house the project this as a

325
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,379
camera thats mounted on top oven outside
10

326
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,100
and its crude and there's a big strong
magnets you can put your video cam on

327
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,950
top of your car

328
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,130
and drive around like passengers worry
about that

329
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:33,770
this is a really good one will only be
sweaty flip the switch and

330
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,280
good race LED's in general

331
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,500
used to be one a dollar at least

332
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,340
be like for boxing now

333
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,399
you there's a session gonna make them
and throw them on things free like

334
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,560
literally throwing them away so

335
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,530
so recommend so you know what can you do
to take part as well

336
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,680
the reason that I think that we have an
opportunity here

337
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,790
is that electrons a lot cheaper

338
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:08,899
intruders more service not heart hard
cider but on the other hand

339
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,890
you can get arm courtship which is like
100 megahertz computer

340
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,940
like this small for a hike box 60 cheap
another thing that's really nice is

341
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,580
because Open Source offers already

342
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,970
really established you can get open free
tools GCC is important to a lot of

343
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:26,300
microcontrollers and microprocessors so

344
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,159
pretty much anyone you to suffer back on
I have a softer background like I was

345
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,220
of a person you can start like
programming stuff and

346
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,100
you know like I public for example
people we program I Potter

347
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,970
also some more examples later things you
can do with free tools but

348
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,650
basically you know internet you don't
have to Thomas mister anymore you can

349
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,850
get circuit boards me

350
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:52,060
30 box there's open source circuit
layout tools and this just

351
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,179
tonics you know point only other tools
available

352
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,490
up to tonight unicef always been around
since accessible again

353
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,350
because there's week eases you too this
lichter you know this

354
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:07,020
so many ways for people to connect
Instructables also to

355
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,220
showing projects so I mean I think it's
great that

356
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,700
almost anyone just get into this even if
all you know right now is PHP reached

357
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,310
him out

358
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,480
it's really not hard their stools gets
out there

359
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,260
such a nice it's no longer like wire
wrapping

360
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,670
its you can like started

361
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,410
so like I did that night so what I do

362
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:33,840
is I make kids and educational

363
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,030
you know you you get a bag apart

364
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,310
and you know L usership service the type

365
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:47,450
a project like this this is the

366
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,510
so you can get

367
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:56,030
bags and a full electronic parts we saw
it together and then you can

368
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,820
this one's a USB charger the 1i should
for have the power cord on

369
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,950
and you literally plugin your pearl for
knocked just happened is she ok

370
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,980
now and then you can just download free
tools AVR GCC

371
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,640
and reprogram it merely these blankets
etc any

372
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,110
yet so and if you can see it but it does
make seen

373
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,100
and sell some people

374
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:27,230
some people look put on their bikes
Kenny my grasp well

375
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:34,210
this guy got to politically class

376
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,340
a San Francisco version no hun
Washington DC

377
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,810
and he said that you look at me to John
your bike you can see it's kinda cool to

378
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,070
I'm now

379
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,149
that's weird I you know

380
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:53,580
you can program the message just in the
the poly people in the audience is

381
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,760
actually office gets a 20 and like it
cost like five dollars

382
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,600
heart you can actually have it's the
skin ass online the codes online you can

383
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,980
you can get the parts for free in Milan
some people do if you look on Flickr

384
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,720
they look so cheap they don't even send
me to 1750 get a circuit board and they

385
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,970
sought to the parts together

386
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,790
I'm sick himself that's fine see and
made a bigger version for bike wheel

387
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:20,790
also to take the same thing that really
big I have it

388
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,629
there's a Mac you like it just odometer
backwards

389
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:36,869
so the next did you

390
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:41,889
supply yes we can wield

391
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:45,989
so I'm I'm burning man with pac man in a
ghost in like you

392
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,940
okay back is this some people

393
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,419
that

394
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:57,249
side not only did what's interesting is
because these tools are so inexpensive

395
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,779
notta lotta education like this project
actually

396
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,169
she skopje schematic do anything at all

397
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:08,679
I don't lie on USB charger for iPod and
people really like you too could begin a

398
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:09,330
project

399
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:12,928
and such but this is more efficient and
better engineered almost anything else

400
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:13,570
on the market

401
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,590
the case is handled if you want to give
the job to get me wrong

402
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,840
because I'm not constrained by old to
make

403
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,990
chief apostle margins are so low you
know I can I can

404
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,309
the do is get a job want to see here's
the part little more expensive but

405
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:31,129
you because no marketing ties that you
have to give overhead posso

406
00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:36,309
in so we have one two batteries

407
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,860
places iPod

408
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:45,100
come up after the talk or defender by
building you can look

409
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,159
will have a couple kids with a few one
get one Hassan said sit down there just

410
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,830
like building it a six-point

411
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:57,830
a so you really interesting because it's
a sort of like an extreme version

412
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:03,039
open source hardware if any money using
musician you've probably heard

413
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,559
ruling TB 303 if not its to really
famous

414
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,928
besides those manufactured 84 and
unfortunately

415
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,570
it was meant to be an accompaniment for
guitarists and like nobody uses

416
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,369
in the really noises but then summer I
think any

417
00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:22,850
Louise early nineties don't

418
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,869
who was that so much people start using
it to me acid techno

419
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:29,169
and it just exploded it was huge
everyone

420
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:32,610
needed TV 3 usually like couple hundred
bucks and

421
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,340
now you going TV taken to get three
thousand dollars but was really nice is

422
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,690
that

423
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,289
you can copyright hardware this is
really great because it means you can

424
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,908
reverse engineer hardline Islamist

425
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:46,499
patents in this case the word any
patents well there was one was actually

426
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,169
the public domain thanks you can

427
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:54,320
you know I we made the exact schematic
circuit diagram made

428
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,649
shit free open-source like I have a
couple hundred people

429
00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:00,710
on these and it's really neat because I
sequencers all

430
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,649
open source also and people actually
went modified

431
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,139
this is amazing you might you buy
synthesizer at it

432
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:11,340
you've got it doesn't it doesn't doesn't

433
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,769
another one wanna my customers really
want swing timing

434
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:18,619
which is when you have sort on the
sixteenth note sometimes for

435
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,330
after jazzy feel and this one

436
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:26,439
the original see if we didn't have it
misled he said on dad and I said sure

437
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,980
there's interrupt do try this this and
this issue happens in

438
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,919
he just needed and then share for more
than the people may uploaded

439
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,070
so there's a couple people out there who
have upgraded to the site is not

440
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,570
if you don't repeat your TV like every
time you like

441
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,610
it's broken I don't fix it you can you
can do that with patchy

442
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:48,409
you can do that Zilla you can do that
with you know any open source software

443
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:51,500
you can't do that was harder right now
so close so

444
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,399
like we really need you guys past doing
we get together

445
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:58,720
wanted it

446
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,279
so we've been trying to do the same
thing so yeah make controller

447
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:06,139
decide systematics and it's basically

448
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:09,690
anytime you want to control any type
devices here good example

449
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,799
like but say if you want to have fun
like your instant message client

450
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,149
change the color up hi

451
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:24,149
you want to have to change the color
lamp so

452
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:29,690
a in a lot of people than me now says
gently to the article like I would do it

453
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,320
a different way

454
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,460
and is awesome cuz I said yeah please do
you know like okay

455
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,809
you know your download the SmackDown
from updated anywhere you want and

456
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:41,149
we'll see how it goes I mean it's a its
first experiment and

457
00:27:41,149 --> 00:27:44,369
like a full-blown get that to be used
just about for anything

458
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:48,340
I and again this is all information
about this is available for

459
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,149
doctor this a camera talking about so

460
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:55,730
us a 1.3 megapixel cameras like the old
lunch box size

461
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,740
ones I we all have we've all bought like
five dollars it I'm

462
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,200
and took apart my you know a be really
need if I could do something else with

463
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:04,539
it

464
00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:07,929
and then get other people to start doing
other things with these there so many of

465
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:08,200
them

466
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,269
I i look the part there's a market share
a report on

467
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:14,929
like which kid cameras are out there the
first research

468
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,500
others like so on bridges I take this
little time which

469
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,580
5552 most common on out there

470
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:26,350
and circling around it so I found that I
can rewire the switch

471
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,350
to are likely take photos as soon as you
turn it on

472
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,850
uses all smart yet like this big like
flash you know

473
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,919
Mike there's no other use for this thing
I don't care if it breaks

474
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:40,210
sure what happens to it so much okay I
don't do I could put on a kite

475
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,330
so iight I took I

476
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,350
and a it went up and up and up and a

477
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,509
and and it crash in survived in this
thing just won't die

478
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:53,889
so I start like I could do other things
so I'm I was a

479
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:56,909
looking at Amazon's a9 search engine

480
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:00,099
and you can type in an address and what
they did is they drove around

481
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,859
just like really expensive car with this
GPS is camera

482
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,240
they put all those dots are voters a the
the to

483
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,210
but you know what it's like to be my own
person this so I took a GPS little

484
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,720
hand-held I took my camera

485
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,899
that are likely to differ is in the GPS
logs

486
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:20,210
as a pretty standard file and has a
timestamp and the camera

487
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:23,429
takes photos timestamp so all ages I

488
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,299
masters together and then I made my own
version have a nine in this is just me

489
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:27,690
drive

490
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,669
the Apple Store like sawyer

491
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,259
are other examples I earlier today there
was the

492
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:40,000
that's visible digital video camera and
we're finding people are

493
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,440
using these products are light

494
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,440
here

495
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:53,779
talk of

496
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:58,740
scale right away

497
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,220
here some other ones the best one is
like kids

498
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,630
Thursday happens people take the store
is in the pudding Flickr

499
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,419
learns about really

500
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,559
other things so

501
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,360
yeah rotary phones I it's kinda sad
story so I

502
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,769
bring this this my self a that they
bring with me everywhere

503
00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:32,769
play it's awesome in restaurants

504
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,770
think about rotary phones

505
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,908
sad yeah this is kinda sad story when I
bring this

506
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,960
places there's a little kid put his hand
in it like his old and he's like I don't

507
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,630
is what a game controllers as I'm like
oh man

508
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,890
bad news I so

509
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,419
yet history cellphone I what you do is
you got a

510
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:01,480
regular self-serve regular on rotary
phone which you can get theirs

511
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,990
drive sales are actually the best place
for them and

512
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:08,179
sparks on electronique so I'm gonna have
their link in the back

513
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:11,360
they sell all the components that you
need basically rewire

514
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,830
and the signals from the the dialer
store

515
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:21,830
and I'm gonna try to do right now give
away something call

516
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:25,399
approach giveaway that room but so what
I want you guys to your phone's out the

517
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:26,409
first person to get

518
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:29,789
to the phone where it's a 2006

519
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:33,090
355

520
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:39,149
1323 F signal

521
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:42,799
rain all

522
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,799

523
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,530
who

524
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:58,530
who is it take about half of the Atlanta

525
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:09,790
ha contest

526
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:16,790
ok

527
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,049
wanna hack rumor

528
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:31,970
also the hacker in a minute nunc 1 now
it's gonna happen is this is on DVD

529
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:38,970
and people watch it I'm gonna get phone

530
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,980
haha

531
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:52,450
also you have lots of fun

532
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,740
send a kickoff to the cell phone numbers
on

533
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,210
and you can anyone else nice

534
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:01,630
so here's a an inside view but

535
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:05,280
that not have the interesting thing
about this particular phone is

536
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,350
the it last forever like if it doesn't
rain but want to start

537
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,680
really drains battery like that in mind
have it turned out a movie theater

538
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,840
someplace ticket

539
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,890
to those are the components VCR's how
many

540
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:21,620
people have VCRs what the fuck are you
doing all these VCRs

541
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,250
there's no they did you can even get VHS
tape same or so we thought about this

542
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,800
for like we're gonna figure out
something to do

543
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,520
with a VCR and we figured out you can
make cat feeder

544
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,270
added um unfortunately looks like a cat
grinder

545
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,770
but

546
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:43,060
defense I feel like cats so for twenty
everyday detected

547
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,100
and this is what I look like again it
doesn't like a I

548
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,460
tech writer cell it just email me like
that schematic sir

549
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,630
it's easy to build then there's the
motors in like its it's getting cats

550
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,010
like I

551
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,420
iRobot makes these a robotic vacuums and

552
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,860
does anyone have one of these fkk if you
look there's a little tiny port on the

553
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,330
side

554
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:09,340
spry of like little Mack connector and

555
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,670
what are the things that up week talk to
I Robot

556
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,710
about a while ago was know would be
great if people to start getting in the

557
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:19,500
robotics without having to do all the
awful things about robotics

558
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,900
if you tried ur ever builder robot you

559
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,290
do a locomotion yeah I got it to move
now I'm tired

560
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,320
I don't feel like doing anything else
ever again you don't get to like ever

561
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,860
focused

562
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,530
on the actual robotics parts so are they
decide to

563
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,540
release Open Interface and you can make
your own

564
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,139
USB to serial director

565
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:47,139
the other way to do it and I think you
have the this is from a

566
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:53,500
a bubble gum container yeah and other
y'all

567
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,690
Apple serial connector and its subtlety

568
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,060
up with you part you can use your phone
or you can use any

569
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,070
bluetooth-enabled computer to control
its control

570
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:09,760
remember and is like it on a project
already we're starting to see

571
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:13,060
on it's our community built around it
there's a book coming out it's like

572
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,990
backs or something and how to get sorry
out there

573
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,700
its its it's being used p kids are using
these robots

574
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,110
as something to learn about electronics
and programming

575
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,140
it's super easy cuz it's Dom serial
interfaces like going to go so you can

576
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,020
like do logo

577
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,640
like the logo up couple shots ovett

578
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,850
someone made a a MIDI interface so you
can use it as a mini instrument its

579
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:38,350
kinda fun

580
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:41,970
II taking this to a lot

581
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,000
yeah so I take it some said farr's and
I'll bring to

582
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,100
and it'll be our yurman verse a

583
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,330
regular room versus other River their
necks the red ball

584
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,779
on his is in cleanup mode it's using its
normal after them to move

585
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,810
the balls around and it thinks is
vacuuming and then the human

586
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:01,920
tries to beat it and like the the robot
wants most the time

587
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,420
so human doesn't land but we also
started an underground river cock

588
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:06,930
fighting

589
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:10,169
time so

590
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,560
I that tiny and you can only stuff
available in like you know of the office

591
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,100
settings

592
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,950
and that's kinda funny get in like
there's money involved

593
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,580
that in and then up there is it one-time
I'll

594
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,770
cited them do real life Frogger

595
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,770
that's a very bad

596
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,579
so you've ever been Austin

597
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:34,079
it's pretty laid back I they didn't
really care too much

598
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,710
asking by just like thinking like cue
yeah

599
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,119
like a strap pretty bad when the cops
like when you're going oh cool in real

600
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,880
Frogger

601
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,670
now cell jobs so we made it

602
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:51,829
pass I

603
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:55,710
half have thinks he should be arrested

604
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,869
yeah so is that a an email so the cops
and said I can't believe that in real I

605
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:00,780
like Austin like

606
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,990
yes than ever been also its cool down
there like a so we made out like a

607
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,160
touristy certain some

608
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,700
cops and everything and we place better
some that betting Spurs

609
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,650
was the only times you can get it back
and forth across the street and everyone

610
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:14,500
said Wyoming

611
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,849
actually was like 10 and then eventually
a white SUV ran over

612
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:21,710
up but survived these there they're
pretty tough so

613
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,809
the TV be gone %uh

614
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:28,170
fun little device you know it's fun the
turn of TV's

615
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:32,559
and we thought it would be more fun if
we added more LED's

616
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,460
like 12 and added more power

617
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:41,059
so this how to turn off the TV up to
like ninety feet away

618
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:44,230
and the battery lasts like

619
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:49,630
really long time yeah and how to do is
on makin

620
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,510
is available on Instructables and a its
it's really fun and then there's another

621
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,130
one

622
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:58,940
outlets if you don't wanna like name
your thing around in like a crazy

623
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:02,480
are you can build inside had cell

624
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,099
yeah it's hard to see but you can over

625
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:13,660
yet so that's the hat

626
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,670
on the outside had underneath cell

627
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,420
its kinda fun to walk around your
favorite electronic store and turn off

628
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:21,859
things and

629
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:26,430
this is part of a bigger project a you
know if you've gone the computer shows

630
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,379
like CSI used to have like fun stuff

631
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,130
now they just have big LCD screens
that's all they're selling so I thought

632
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:32,930
to be kinda fun

633
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:36,730
I don't know if someone do it maybe I I
would laugh about it but like to put in

634
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,710
a helium balloon

635
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,349
and have this kind appointed down all
day just like with the brain is like 90

636
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:42,779
fwy

637
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:47,730
turn it off a

638
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,480
legos another knee company that their

639
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,650
latest round robots I the firmware you
can

640
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,049
do anything you want for they do that
now so this isn't

641
00:38:58,049 --> 00:39:01,759
next give us the doing weird things like
as any Western

642
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,680
USB Drive like a vending machine say it
like you can get the start

643
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:11,308
a and the the leggett communities did a
really good job sharing all

644
00:39:11,309 --> 00:39:15,049
the program you can play connect for
versa

645
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:18,349
like us valid line following robot

646
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:22,980
and things are starting to to advance
even more critical than about the future

647
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:27,069
and what's changing well there's
commoditization

648
00:39:27,069 --> 00:39:31,079
a the hardware there's the software
that's that's free Lego and

649
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,339
there's over projects that you build
everything virtually

650
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:38,000
and then you know which pics sore
starting to see that that might be

651
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,900
something that happens

652
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,740
your future with some electronics summer
the other project

653
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,940
people so again about

654
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:50,720
mark billing stuff you you can get
involved everything is meeting like

655
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,289
Chinese

656
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:55,880
sweatshops now like this one and it
kinda bad because it means that began at

657
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,279
6

658
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:59,359
it cannot like you open stuff it's a
complicated weird

659
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,509
but there's also some side effects one
other I side-effect again discussed that

660
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,279
now so much talk earlier is that stuff
is so cheap that

661
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:12,329
if you if you break if you can break it
doesn't matter it was ten dollars a ten

662
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,309
dollar camcorder

663
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:16,490
camcorder who cares if you can former
hockey

664
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:20,109
like you know if you mess up wicked
anyone least

665
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:23,490
lost firmware upgrades and messed up
understand this

666
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,569
tragic device good you know

667
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:29,880
Constitution hardware you can go in
there and

668
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,520
mess with stuff like mess with this
digital camera into

669
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,859
care of a really popular cause I think
it's great

670
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:42,089
is a lot your Havanese wrt54g

671
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:45,339
sis so for example again you know she

672
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:49,839
LA Times the turnout research chief you
can get encore for nothing

673
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,930
inside this chip is actually next
computer

674
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,328
and that is all the routing is actually
is tolley do this

675
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:59,960
and it isn't negative sources open
source information

676
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,750
because the way information people
started building communities where you

677
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,829
can like shares which

678
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:09,270
your router skinny again you don't need
to actually no

679
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:13,279
ellen Johnson Jane degree to get start
messing with hardware

680
00:41:13,279 --> 00:41:17,000
like rounder that's just a nice it's
it's a it's nice that firmwares

681
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,559
is it's possible from so cheap she with
open source tools

682
00:41:21,559 --> 00:41:25,220
you know iPod clinics again its you know
you can do stuff like this

683
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,359
you know in five years difficult and you
know nothing that's that's an

684
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,040
interesting

685
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,200
to see in the next five to 10 years just
as ten years ago

686
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,910
pentium computer 100 megahertz pentium
possible thousand dollars in a CD burner

687
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:40,879
once the

688
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,099
400 bucks and it was leaked out bro

689
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:48,200
and now to you can get a list enough to
get tickets so come on height so cheap

690
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,309
well you this machine like one on the
left is it PCB router

691
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:56,880
it's actually about the states not to
and one on the right is an email

692
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,410
and CV theoretically just as laser
printers

693
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,859
over 5,000 10,000 other but it could be
that you know one day

694
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,420
stab revolution that people talk about
these could be in your home you could

695
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,690
buy

696
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,349
Sears so you could download open source
information

697
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:16,140
how to build a USB charger Press print
and I'll print that the case

698
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:19,589
on the many male picked up the circuit
board and the order some parts

699
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:23,130
Amazon Amazon currently selling like
tonic

700
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,279
s trying to get to that market and they
do the stuff at home what can I say

701
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:30,849
do it yourself fabrication incredibly
cheap

702
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:35,119
on the fly you know you can compile
stuff at home

703
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,760
CD-rom burners never there are like five
thousand dollars they're cheaper

704
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,770
laser printers others like

705
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,279
too expensive for anyone have I use a
laser cutter laser-etched

706
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:48,599
RCA from you accident notch on the back
nine hour but

707
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,130
so used to be applied to 30,000 lbs 11
others like 10

708
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,180
10k a lot many for ten thousand dollars

709
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,009
its 18 by 12 word acrylic vinyl anything

710
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,359
you wanna get so meet you can do a lot
of really cool stuff

711
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:05,440
you have to say to see people I know
people are find them

712
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,829
basements expensive to live now

713
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:12,430
not and other examples are google has
Google Earth

714
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,230
and like it's not really clear with
Google's doing but I cannot be doing for

715
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,520
the keep like releasing some interesting
things

716
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,380
so our those that have ruled the world
yeah are they doing well

717
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,809
but there's some interesting tools that
they have like Google Earth

718
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:29,049
you can start to pick your own buildings
in there okay that's interesting they

719
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:32,579
product company cults catch up and you
can it's like a relief

720
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,650
need rapid prototyping environment and
it's free on PCs that people are

721
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:39,160
building what they're gonna put in their
homes and they take before and after

722
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:39,848
pictures

723
00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:43,609
and we're going if our oh well you can
actually build entire house

724
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,790
and once the the glue that the software
that will tie the

725
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,099
electronic drawings to what the physical
hardware is

726
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:54,250
you'll pull a lever and you can get the
stuff delivered to you up all of our

727
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,130
projects

728
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,099
and make we're gonna try to do is get
suffers and so if you want to learn how

729
00:43:58,099 --> 00:43:59,160
to build

730
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,230
we have like a potato cannon which is
really fussy dictators are in a bit

731
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:03,009
peace

732
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:06,059
PVC pipe and we're gonna show how to do
it

733
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:09,770
like step-by-step be a 3d so you can
like modified different pieces

734
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:13,109
and where it's going this is the milling
machine

735
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:16,529
not massive multiplayer online games
like World of Warcraft uneven

736
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,910
the user-created communities of Second
Life there's an open source tool called

737
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,299
dollars at all other yeah I'll and you
can get the

738
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:27,930
the geometric shapes outta using OpenGL

739
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:31,149
and you can get the shakes out like this
guy made a sheep so you like bill to see

740
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,309
in the virtual world that's it looks
like and then emailed it

741
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:37,319
at a farm support there's some early
indications

742
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:41,329
someone built an entire city and then
this is printed out on a 3d printer so

743
00:44:41,329 --> 00:44:43,380
we're getting close to being able to

744
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,849
get the parts to you that what causes

745
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:50,289
as much as it does now like cost more
sometimes the ship something from Amazon

746
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:53,920
the actual or wherever up and that

747
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,349
have leads to the the future

748
00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:00,970
up what else is out there needs to be
open source and like one example that I

749
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:02,170
like two years

750
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:05,220
is there's a really big problem with
their

751
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,940
mortality rate of infants in like the
rest of the world and equipment

752
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,990
there call baby wonders the equipment
out there is expensive it's hard to get

753
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,200
shipped out there so a doctor came up

754
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,710
with inexpensive way to do it using
regular light bulb so she actually

755
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:19,890
sketched out

756
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,618
this design use regular light bulbs with
damn and mortality rate cut happened so

757
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:27,200
these plans are getting shares are
getting distributive

758
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,460
using local materials there's there's
likes this really good reasons to do a

759
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,400
lot of this and like

760
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,349
the trick is like how do we get people
involved like my trip like do something

761
00:45:34,349 --> 00:45:35,720
with an iPod like everyone's like

762
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,730
doesn't well eventually this is
something that people might start to

763
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:41,339
think about other things I like

764
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:44,779
voting machines likewise it is open
source why the papers is

765
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:48,160
up water purification medical public
transportation like

766
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,089
you think I've open source hardware
projects out there that we just benefit

767
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:55,230
everyone there's a new project that

768
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:58,490
there to playing out in South Africa
that it's a merry-go-round

769
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:01,869
and his kids %uh it's been around
america rockets water pump

770
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:04,950
and it pops all the water upset
justifying it's fun they also sell

771
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:05,730
advertising

772
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,730
sites so there's there's yeah so there's
things like that so I'm some resources

773
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,029
for an open up for questions and also
after

774
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:15,619
up of course make up you know to send
any mail facility

775
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:19,869
if I all 26 dot com and I'll give
everyone a copy a digital copy the first

776
00:46:19,869 --> 00:46:24,029
issue make so popular sizes h2o section

777
00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:27,109
how to find out which is good course
2600

778
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:30,400
make website pack today I Instructables

779
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,599
this is one of the few places right now
that's kinda wrapping a lot of this

780
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,819
putting in one place you can put your
projects like any particular software

781
00:46:36,819 --> 00:46:37,549
project

782
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:40,869
just right on struggles dot com and
resume crips you can see the type of

783
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:42,589
projects that people are putting in
their

784
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:45,420
like right now are the projects are
kinda weird like there's teaser gloves

785
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,029
that speaking

786
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:49,089
here its Kenny on

787
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,700
Flickr a few certain if you look for tax
for how-to & DIY

788
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,630
we have a mic Flickr photo Paul and it's
kind of like a lite version

789
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,569
Instructables

790
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:59,790
people's put up they're built photos and
you can see like step-by-step

791
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,980
about things are building and %uh spark
fun electronics is where I said

792
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,079
a check to regular basis like all the
things you see here like

793
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:10,869
sparked fun cells have a lot of
electronics and %uh fidgets that's where

794
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,930
the RFID

795
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:15,489
readers are from and so the little RFID

796
00:47:15,489 --> 00:47:18,609
parts and they also have a deal with the
guy

797
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:23,700
Road RFID hacks projects and that's a
really good book to check out different

798
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,549
RFID

799
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:27,569
projects that this is a information

800
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:32,029
mine and I think we've got a few minutes
for questions and if there's no

801
00:47:32,029 --> 00:47:35,750
and afterwards yeah everyone does it the
big question

802
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:38,880
difficult him a questions get a copy at
least

803
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,390
you make yeah a question cell

804
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:48,400
yeah but they're right there

805
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,880
really it's like extra

806
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,640
left side alright so

807
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,670
questions got a few minutes get ideas

808
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,070
officers projects yeah neither are I'm

809
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,430
I'm actually in the process doing a
couple and somebody donate some space to

810
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:08,830
me

811
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:14,270
like to call the gym computers and stuff
got some kids I'm actually and I was

812
00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:15,310
getting discouraged by

813
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:19,610
militarization is there so much hardware
so this is great because

814
00:48:19,610 --> 00:48:23,110
extra information I didn't have about
how to hack things that are almost

815
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:27,880
surface mount loath me is that yes this
is getting sluts getting many tries to

816
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,760
technology allows for it

817
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,910
on the other hand I think even stock
fund has a kid for

818
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,330
temperature controlling a Black and
Decker reflow

819
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,810
Black & Decker if lovin the 7 they have
a little chip

820
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:43,390
temperature control and do reflux you
can get like a5

821
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,859
Delores Lovett in your kitchen to dougie
lead so don't you can use that to like

822
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,310
decider chips again johnnie something
similar I miss technologies out there

823
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:56,460
and again internet is fine so maximize
my question's going to be

824
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,200
what's the best way to find people in my
area because I'm I'm hooking up with

825
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,900
course the internets great and making
all that you deserve n you for like

826
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,680
finding

827
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:10,330
out is close to you yes i mean the
Research Triangle Park area

828
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,340
North Carolina and might be I know a lot
of people that are

829
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,680
hundreds of miles away from I don't know
a lot of people that are within 30 miles

830
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:22,169
yeah but I tended suggest is go to
flicker of course it disposable project

831
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,990
the budget ax as you can for your
location

832
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,200
good Instructables bigger location these
groups are self warming up to make forms

833
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,440
there's always a call for makers like
people say like a i mean I mean

834
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,150
Indiana whatever I I'm looking to do a
project with someone like it's like

835
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,830
it's like matchmaker but not really like
that don't you can search on the dress

836
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:44,540
yeah okay yeah Radiohead group to and
what up coming out or

837
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:48,100
there's like there's a fence in like a
lot of areas and we also have an event

838
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:48,770
listing

839
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:51,850
on make that we try to but out there in

840
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:54,960
everyone can send in everything submit
your event in there too or whatever even

841
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,760
if it's just a meeting

842
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,610
that's I

843
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:04,120
um you talk a lot about open source
hardware

844
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,339
how does that relate to hands and

845
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,810
how would you protect your open source
hardware from being patented by somebody

846
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:11,310
else

847
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:14,750
on you can't hand something that's been
released into the public domain that's

848
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:15,310
just

849
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:18,680
if you look at the way the patent system
works once you've really something

850
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,700
%um you they could and you have to fight
it court which is unfortunate but

851
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:26,040
same thing happened same thing happens
with open source software

852
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,180
illnesses have to be at convinced police
said

853
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,470
but you can't pass up it's an open
source I mean that's fine

854
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:36,750
yes that's the best trade-off publish it
because it

855
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:42,120
right for 50 bucks the Patent Office has
a Gazette that you can publish things in

856
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,200
check that would that would

857
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,330
you post any word from my you

858
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,610
high art but that you might have to
defend it in court is

859
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:58,560
when I love okay that's good are you
fully with the rep rep at project

860
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,920
yeah yeah school stuff and is that

861
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,060
already covered by patents existing
patents

862
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:09,910
don't know offhand you'll have to look
into I have no clue either

863
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:16,910
Askim she I'm a real curious

864
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,680
if you guys have made any attempt to
connect with free energy

865
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,380
device creators different dinners I'm
going to the

866
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,860
test at a convention which is coming up
in a

867
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,870
in a week or so and was wondering if
there's a

868
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,430
resource that I could use to try and
convincingly

869
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:37,650
remote I'll open source

870
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:42,220
their their hardware and their devices
for the website crashes the mighty

871
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:46,200
the visit and all the sudden the
technologies

872
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,700
years I think they should open source
because there's a lot of skeptics of

873
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,060
course about free energies

874
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:55,240
ever free up the so they should really
yeah I mean absolutely like this you

875
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,940
post up a destructive all early

876
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,760
you know howto & play her something but
as far as

877
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:04,540
a convincing them there's a ton of
benefits

878
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,250
I i think is like we get a lot of emails
we might do an issue

879
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,660
that kinda looks at somebody's free
energy ideas and concepts

880
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,100
and like you know how it works out as
are currently all that in everything in

881
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,560
between

882
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,810
so I'm emailing I mean like more we're
gonna be covering this on make

883
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:23,670
early next year so I would have them you
know you at the same address you gave

884
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,860
yes Washington that's fine but yeah they
definitely should open source their

885
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,380
ideas

886
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,310
thanks has gone

887
00:52:32,310 --> 00:52:35,860
you know that really a question just

888
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,610
comment I've been playing with a lot of
this stuff for

889
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,660
pic chips things like that all these
projects

890
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,950
a real good source for all these old
electronics /url the

891
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:51,850
ham radio fast totally ARRL .org they
have a list

892
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:54,900
times dates places all is

893
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,050
here knee-deep in all

894
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,050
video recorders and camcorders styles

895
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:05,120
day hand fast doesn't ham radio liked it
if done all the stuff already

896
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:09,330
we just expanding I mean a this is all
if you tell him it is all to you like

897
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,170
bill yet did

898
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:14,260
I mean on straight but was

899
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,360
tragic create a large community so yeah
refs

900
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,310
meet people there get parts right to
keep

901
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,850
model train guys to make them print they
have like there like the best furniture

902
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,970
for guys like thought

903
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:31,050
let's all thanks

904
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,040
I FeO D-day state a receives additions
like if I am

905
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,050
project currently working on back in
just a minute

906
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:41,450
because I'm actually building something

907
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:42,120
effects

908
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:47,400
and and ends at the salon stuff just
communities for people to do that

909
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,430
yesterday

910
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:51,530
positions I like new ham radio hackers

911
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:56,320
decade yeah i think is a new we pay

912
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,150
higher 10 trying to get information from
manufactures regarding hardware and how

913
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,130
to access it

914
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,650
one of the common excuses or reasons
they give especially in anything art

915
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:06,590
related

916
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,610
is that the implement regulatory
compliance and software

917
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:14,950
if they open that everybody would be
regulatory violation it would be a mess

918
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,410

grandma down the stairs
