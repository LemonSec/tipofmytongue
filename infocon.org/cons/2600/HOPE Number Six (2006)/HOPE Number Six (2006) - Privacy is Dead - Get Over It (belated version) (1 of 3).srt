elements to get here

43
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,760
I wonder why thank Stevens for allowing

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,250
arranging all this and making it
possible

45
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:58,250
of course a person really think is the
person who was stopped for a lotta held

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,920
in July

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,920
and came back to give the talk he wasn't
able to give in July steer event

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,770
as Eric pointed out this is a quite a
bit if

49
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,820
unfinished business three months late
but

50
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,390
the better late than never where we

this up

53
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,810
I got an email from him out of the blue
he said

54
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,120
I i understand that no idea who he was

55
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,690
didn't have any affiliation with 2600 i
knoooow

56
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,420
be sent email to me I think I was
actually in

57
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,680
in the far east at the time and the

58
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,130
I'll it said something along the lines
of

59
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,079
my name is or city Lebedev and I would
like you to come to

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,100

and give the speech and with email back
and forth and

62
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,090
first why didn't believe that somebody
with the name or city Lebedev

63
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,800
exist and basically he just kept saying
come to Stevens on the on the 16th

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,270
everything will be fine and

65
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,140
you know can you make it how big a room
do you need and I'm thinking like

66
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:23,590
yup sure Borat I'm gonna fall for this
you know i i expected to come here and

67
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,210

68
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,460
shiny gold thong with the wrestling bear
or something

69
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,169
but the that that's the board

70
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,310
come back after 12 up

71
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,500
the fact that that

72
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,640
this late in the game with crappy
weather

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,520
I don't know where that we have a a
standing-room-only crowd is entirely

74
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,229
dude or something so given by
refinancing

75
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:58,790
you your

76
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,510
let me very quickly tell you what we're
doing here today

77
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,990
a this is normally part pov

78
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:10,280
eat our full day course which use

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,390
half a day computer-aided investigation
and half a day for an investigation

80
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,650
the computer-aided investigation portion
which

81
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,840
we've modified into a privacy something
or up

82
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,070
for 2600 is

83
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,580
is essentially designed to teach
investigators law enforcement

84
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,219
people with a genuine need to know how
to track people down and find

85
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,919
things out about them how to do it
before they go out in the field

86
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,159
computer-aided investigation database

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,080
access is now a social poor love

88
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,490
any investigator or law enforcement
officers toolkit

89
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,990
not in the afternoon we move on to the
for an investigation portion of it

90
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,690
where we cover what to do if they have
to go out of the country

91
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,969
over the years working with 2600

92
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,840
we've put together a speech

93
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,800
and we've realized that privacy is in
fact the mirror image I've

94
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,880
database investigation you can talk
about access to people's personal

95
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,850
information

96
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,840
and you can't talk about who can access
it without discussing

97
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:26,840
what's out there and should be able to
access

98
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,188
as part of the summit or that I was
supposed to give ninety days ago

99
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:35,800
giving tonight we asked for a volunteer
with us for victim

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,909
somebody to callin or right in

101
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,998
and allow us to essentially invade his
privacy find out everything we could

102
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:44,499
about it

103
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:50,229
and we got a number of for a number
volunteers most of them were people who

104
00:06:50,229 --> 00:06:51,210
were either

105
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,650
too young or too nice to have any sort
of history

106
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:01,430
thank goodness a guy by the name of
record a convo to know work

107
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:06,719
is a is very active in the online
community is also a writer in most

108
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,339
recent rogue mafia

109
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,110
pretty remarkable guy and there's a ton
of stuff about american workers would

110
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,430
powerful guy so not

111
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,479
not all that is is a just simple where
does he live in where does he work stuff

112
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:20,050
is your

113
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:26,289
as you'll see because a French
cooperation we were able to put together

114
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,339
a program

115
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,669
which you'll see in a second that allows
us to talk about

116
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,709
what's out there in private hands
proprietary databases corporate

117
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:35,539
databases

118
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,998
credit bureaus non-governmental database

119
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:43,729
let me just dismiss governmental
databases today by saying

120
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,409
everything that you see us do here today
government is 50 times as much

121
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,469
and they have access to everything that
you didn't seem to

122
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:58,009
we're not going to talk about NCIC fin
sandwiches were all your financial

123
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:58,939
history

124
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,029
news text text to any of the

125
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,800
incarnations of the database is used by
what used to be Treasury what's now

126
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,099
Homeland Security that sort of thing
we're not going to talk about that we're

127
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:12,330
gonna talk about stuff

128
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,620
that skilled private investigator or

129
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,990
a governmental investigator with access
to private databases

130
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:25,270
can access what we're also not going to
do today

131
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,110
is what I'm not going to do today is
have a point of view

132
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,440
I'm gonna lay this out for you in as
neutral

133
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,349
a manner as possible now granted 7

134
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,039
FBI agents in ray jackets coming in the
first time I try to give the speech

135
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,539
shows

136
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,490
sorta skewed my opinion some more but

137
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,500
still I am NOT convince

138
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:57,010
that on one hand all the databases need
to be close or on the other hand

139
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:00,970
all the databases need to be open to the
world i mean there are legitimate

140
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,630
reasons for access

141
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,810
we'll be talking about that so as

142
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,240
as I say in all the talks I give I'm not
going to tell you what to think but I am

143
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,290
gonna try to tell you

144
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,589
what to think about database collection
has been

145
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,860
around forever since the days of the
Bible people have been counted

146
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,510
people have been pigeonhole people have
been to categorize

147
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,779
here's what's different in the past 10
years

148
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:32,899
first the ball computing power and speed
I have now

149
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,510
in my office more data

150
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,769
and more data storage space than the FBI
computers had 10 years ago

151
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,319
storage space you can go now

152
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:50,019
to the store and get a 750 gig drive for
what about 300 box

153
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,199
you can set up an array of computers
that will process whatever data

154
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:59,829
you gather so quickly that ten years ago
you would have had to use

155
00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:03,720
literally a crazy supercomputer to do
the equivalent amount computed

156
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,189
everything

157
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,730
everything is now individual former

158
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,790
everything you do when you fill out an
application when you buy an item

159
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,469
when you make a telephone call when you
go through

160
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,380
EZ Pass Lane or use a metalcore
everything is

161
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,160
already in digital format which means
taking it

162
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,889
putting in a database analyzing it
indexing

163
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:34,100
never has to be touched by human hands

164
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,069
you today not some third-party typing in
front of the terminal

165
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:44,309
you are contributing all the data about
you OC or

166
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:48,270
optical character recognition even the
old a

167
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:52,790
the stuff that's on paper forms twenty
years ago thirty years ago

168
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:57,480
is being OC or at the speed of light and
it's being sucked into databases

169
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,360
and walleye because data is worth money

170
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,760
you access a database you typically pay

171
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,970
a substantial flat rate taxes that
database can be thousands of dollars a

172
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,449
month

173
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:14,220
or you pay per search and the more hits
the user gets

174
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,750
the more money the database provider
gets

175
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,529
and the happier they are so they can
keep suckin info

176
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:26,929
so your pay for access to

177
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:31,720
people are also willingly we're gonna
talk about this in great detail tonight

178
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,689
people are also

179
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:37,849
willingly contributing enormous amounts
of personal data about themselves

180
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,029
was a personal I don't mean their
address and phone number

181
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:45,029
I mean ridiculously personal things you
go to MySpace pages

182
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,829
people talk about drug use sexual
activity here religion

183
00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:52,569
you know sexual orientation politics
things they

184
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:57,640
won't tell their own family anybody who
accesses their MySpace page

185
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,250
is going to be able to determine
immediately and by the way all of that

186
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,529
data there are box right now

187
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:07,779
my parts other people's blogs running
through myspace running through

188
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:08,740
Friendster

189
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,589
running through people and everything
else shotgun known that information

190
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,170
categorize it

191
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:19,329
if if you think that a MySpace page is

192
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:24,990
is not access the less somebody knows to
go to your MySpace page

193
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,850
that's wrong there is for example a free
service now called the road race

194
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,299
that routinely when you put in
somebody's name address and telephone

195
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:33,439
number

196
00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:38,459
searches MySpace and Friendster and all
of the and all of the online sites

197
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,299
the relationship so it's the post
insights for any of the information that

198
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:44,939
you put it

199
00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:49,769
finally the main thing that's changed is
cross-reference

200
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,160
fifteen years ago I was working on a
murder case in texas

201
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,459
and the sheriff's department that I was
working with so

202
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:01,370
we gotta catch em that the person

203
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,600
who committed the murder lived at this
location 34 years ago

204
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,709
and came back we checked all the old
city directories

205
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,490
we couldn't find anything because I had
in my office

206
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,850
every Texas driver's license and motor
vehicle

207
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,269
I was able to walk through our system do

208
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,779
I did back then it wasn't even index was
just a simple group orgy units search

209
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:27,540
for the address it came up we give it to
the show support for the great the guy

210
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,890
confessed he's no executed Texas kills
you

211
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,689
committed but basically he was

212
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:41,160
court by his driver's license at that
time the state taxes the DPS the people

213
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,260
who

214
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:45,689
maintain the driver's license data bases
could not do

215
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:49,549
a search by address private industry
could

216
00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:54,290
and and by the way as you'll see private
industry is leading

217
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:58,130
everything that we're talking about the
US government is still

218
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,350
three four five six years behind in
terms of cross-reference across indexing

219
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,439
developing a

220
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,589
you know artificial intelligence
programs until two years ago

221
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:13,819
there was still nonplussed index records

222
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,399
or some Osama bin Laden because some
databases

223
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,939
misspelled his name and they didn't have

224
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:25,579
a program written that would search for
name variations

225
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:32,579
me we talked about how an investigator
bill to biographical profile

226
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:37,579
in the example longer be using we
started with ripped a concise

227
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:40,730
telephone number and typically that's
very very often how

228
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,720
how a case starts you either have a name
and address or telephone number

229
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,120
or a license plate have warn appear

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,579
one tiny bit of data that you're gonna
try to expand from

231
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,640
well for the telephone what book

232
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,709
for telephone number you know you can
get a new dress

233
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,449
from that even beginning investigator
can get a date of birth and social

234
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:04,790
security number

235
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,079
now by the way what you're looking at
you on the Holy Grail

236
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,319
up database access these or viv

237
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,519
far I've key pieces of information

238
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,009
that almost every database indexes by
their birth Social Security number name

239
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,389
address and telephone

240
00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:25,819
from there you can get past the dresses
and family members including

241
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:29,689
what's the holy grail of everybody else
the mother's maiden name

242
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:33,310
place of employment businesses
corporations

243
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,879
you no so for everything that you look
in your area is only basic stuff

244
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,529
real property marriage divorce records
voter registration

245
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:44,699
criminal record civil court republic
following

246
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,420
all sorts of other public filings
including by the way weapons permits

247
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,629
driver's license motor vehicles
accidents credit reports phone bills

248
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:57,949
credit card bills 800 number calls
purchasing history

249
00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:02,199
charitable donations I've got no room
left on the page so

250
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:06,139
let's go out to other things not
typically

251
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,899
every investigator every investigative
law enforcement officer most

252
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:15,749
porters won't go out and gather the sort
of information on a person

253
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:18,899
before they contacted before they talked
to do you want to know

254
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,620
who you're talking to you want to have a
picture have the person that you're

255
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,920
talking to

256
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,249
so you know what to say what not to say
maybe some common

257
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:31,889
point of interest that you can bring up
and developer who or

258
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,079
every investigator axis is the sort of
information and

259
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,740
and much much more

260
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,990
strewn about myspace for second here's
information that's

261
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,910
typically on MySpace not gonna tell you
I started out as an investigator which

262
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,009
is twenty plus years ago

263
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,259
to get this sort of information on
someone I would charge a thousand

264
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,499
dollars

265
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:58,949
which was good money when I just ordered
this this would be considered

266
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:03,100
a phenomenal background investigation a
phenomenal background report

267
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,750
this is for myspace tonight just realize
what you're looking at

268
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,050
people put in their name the date of
birth at their age their city

269
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,928
photos of use the pay of fortune to get
a form somebody before

270
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,520
I went out looking for the mall looking
to talk to them I wanted to be sure

271
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,648
I was talking to the right person know
there are millions and millions and

272
00:17:23,649 --> 00:17:24,709
millions and

273
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:28,199
tens of millions of people's photos

274
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,929
on MySpace and on the other sites and
I've got to tell you they're being

275
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,720
sucked down by a third party

276
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,590
they're based where they went to school
where they worked

277
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,320
their music the the music they like
books they read with their friends are

278
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,730
all of this is typically on a myspace
talk page

279
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,450
is a perfect example I don't know how
clears this

280
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,980
no are let me let me just tough

281
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:58,669
we just are you that somebody rain
Dhamaal go

282
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:03,770
who put up just a warm who were hinting
school read about her life

283
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:07,129
talking about how she was molested by
her dad and his name

284
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:10,690
and by the way yes that would come up if
I was investigating

285
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:15,639
are how her first husband was abusive
how she got into a variety of types of

286
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:16,790
relationships

287
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:20,570
everything she won through and how she
came at the end and she's now in a

288
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,020
better place and so on and so forth

289
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,840
the pointy ears ten years ago

290
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,918
do to get this sort of information on
someone

291
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,510
you have to question their friends their
neighbors their family members or

470
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,200
thought it was going to be the next page
Monster dot com for example

471
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,840
hosts its from employers also hosts
residents

472
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,899

473
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:08,120
current archived resumes and these or

474
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,149

possibly want to know about the person

475

00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,360
their experiences by experience that
means everywhere there

477
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,860
they overworking what they did there and

those of you who are interested

481
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,750
they call it a principal technology risk

00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,120
Ethical Hacker and the

483
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,210
here's a job description notes of a
search

484
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,690
saba search is an example of how
previously

485
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,730
obscuring on available information is
now available to

486
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:56,179
anybody with more already Assouline or

487
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:59,809
you can drag themselves into the library
and use their computer

488
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:03,970
here is kevin Mitnick and that is in
fact use all the home address in

489
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,309
California

490
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:11,779
a report here we want to sue main foes

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,529
all of that and they certainly frankly
in the most remarkably intelligent work

494
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:27,690
they must serve a phenomenal AI engine
because

495
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,720
it shows we're going to school it shows
that he's involved

496
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,070
2600 and so on and so forth

497
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,168
I would spend all day here going through
all the various sites but Hughes

498
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:45,269
a variety of other sites that gather
whether you wanted to or not

499
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:49,580
just by virtue of how you access what
you know you're accessing

tell you this site is in

528
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:42,090
Australia for reasons that will be
immediately obvious to you all

529
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,169
this is FBI informants

530
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:48,240
government informants undercover agents

531

and I've got it all year I have used
this on cases I'm actually gonna be

533
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:57,049

534
00:33:57,049 --> 00:34:01,720

535
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,200
some instructed by my attorney not to

536
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,080
i mean here's whose here's a perfect
example

537
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,540
you can read a guy's name is Thomas
Evans is 32 years old he's in

538
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,830
Massachusetts

539
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,299
he used to be all the towns user is a
rat for the Massachusetts State Police

540
00:34:21,299 --> 00:34:24,609
and the DEA all sorts of stuff on as
background stuff is that

541
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,290
in this picture I think that's probably
a your book for but never worse pretty

542
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,639
good

543
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,549
I mean he it's just it's just this
astounding

544
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:37,639
some others you know you have to
discount occupation

545
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,509
suits home and collect welfare

546
00:34:41,509 --> 00:34:47,460
now all love this is stuff everything
that I've covered so far is split

547
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,850
no trouble either you or someone on your

548
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:55,359
half can access not think about this
think about the picture

549
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,940
that just the stuff I've shown you can

550
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,520
paint on 81 unless you the YouTube are
living in a

551
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,580
cabin in the woods and even then I no

552
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:10,080
where your kiss you paying taxes on the
cabin and thats public record

553
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,069
but everywhere you live everywhere you
live forever live

554
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:19,920
everywhere you work your phone
information who you talk to on the phone

555
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,980
what you buy what you allege in is what
your sexual orientation is

556
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,290
you know where you are at a given moment
we're going to tractors in a second

557
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:35,180
I mean it's not to the point where I can
tell you physically or most of the time

558
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:38,230
no let's talk about some other stuff MI
be

559
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:42,640
small their hands medical information
bureau

560
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,890
insurance claims insurance applications

561
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:49,799
anything to do with you buying applying
for

562
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:54,230
or using insurance

563
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,310
ID skins how many of you go into
buildings are going to bars

564
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,930
or going to public locations you let
them

565
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,270
take a scare a few drivers license
either

566
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,440
down on a played or through

567
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,730
a card reader let me tell you this
happens this

568
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,859
this company alone get scammed seventeen
million times a year

569
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,730
and I wanna tell you he gets socked
immediately into a database

570
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,740
and ultimately goes the companies like
ChoicePoint or size and

571
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:32,740
or whatever and it goes into the store
of knowledge available on

572
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,870
let me let me talk to you for speaking
about about what I call Ron bombs law of

573
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,730
unintended data use

574
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,560
every bit of data that's out there no
matter the reason that it was collected

575
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,850
for

576
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,990
will eventually be accessed and used by
somebody like me

577
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:54,650
I'm one of the good ones it'll also be
used by somebody

578
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:59,160
not so nice Domino's Pizza is a perfect
example

579
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,180
you call dominos you dial the same 800
number no matter where you are

580
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,419
Domino's has direct telco access

581
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:13,020
when you dial that eight hundred-number
your number comes up on any

582
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,640
and dominoes knows right away address

583
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,660
name its list that too whether it's a
payphone a paid phone

584
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,850
a cell phone whatever and they say

585
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:27,540
I in their system by the way takes that
information and routes it to the

586
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,450
dominoes

587
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,310
geographically closest to you so in ball
but the dominoes two blocks away

588
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,680
answers it's been routed through all
that

589
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,970
and bobbitt that Domino's has on the
street in front of them all the

590
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,880
information

591
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,540
how may I help you you like blah blah
blah it goes into the database will let

592
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,310
me tell you something

593
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:53,250
state of Missouri the NYPD the US
Marshals Service

594
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,960
host a big collection agencies by that
date

595
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,960
and i wanna read you a quote

596
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,940
from from dominos for collection

597
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,529
pizza delivery list so what are the best
sources used to locate people

598
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:11,460
to people the first time that your
babysitter orders pizza

599
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:14,560
they have your name and address that's
absolutely true

600
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,279
so there's a lot of steps that are being
cool water fugitives that appear in

601
00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:18,980
court

602
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,710
because they ordered pizza about where
this is not as Domino's Papa John's in

603
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,540
all the major chains

604
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,920
are sometimes that's that's kinda funny
about Domino's

605
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,380
this is not so fun

606
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,420
there's a variety of programs that

607
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:40,540
were in the making to develop a secure
flyer program the purpose of this

608
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,920
program is

609
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,380
you go through a background in those who
consider showing go through background

610
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,319
investigation

611
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:50,819
then alternately if you come out clean
you come out the other end they can

612
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:51,710
verify

613
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:55,859
you are who you say you are you're not
you know living in a room with three

614
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,770
guys recently arrived from

615
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:02,810
Yemen in ordering you know you re I
guess it through the mail

616
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,830
they will give you a special core

617
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:11,029
secure flyer frequent traveler there was
a whole host the names

618
00:39:11,029 --> 00:39:14,180
well there's really no reliable way to
do

619
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,710
I mean I can tell you that you can build
very very good under your steel

620
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:23,109
someone else and apply for this car and
breeze right through

621
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:27,040
as if you are good guy

622
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,060
so the program's been cancelled these
programs or now

623
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,160
pretty much officially dead we've got
all this information that they've been

624
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,220
compiled

625
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,660
names addresses telephone numbers
criminal history

626
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:43,080
for a history purchase history

627
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,069
all sorts of stuff that they've
amalgamated to find out who you are

628
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:50,470
this is a phenomenally valuable they
have its remember databases are about

629
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,220
Mon

630
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,400
pretty much well

631
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,660
there's a company now called you to you

632
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,950
that is going to take this data and use
it to

633
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:07,060
I'm gonna quote here provide individual
entertainment options for flyers

634
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:11,009
the news what they say for example if
your buying habits just that you're a

635
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,279
baseball fan

636
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:16,100
maybe you're in flight movie will be the
natural

637
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,870
really need to do dinner complete of the
JetBlue about

638
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:24,370
having 22 chosen for any use which the
one you like

639
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,930
I mean it's a BS excuse but this in

640
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:32,580
this information that you've now in some
cases contributed

641
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,009
in some cases the airlines contributed
in some cases

642
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,020
this part of pilot programs the US
government contributed

643
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,380
is now going to go to a private database
so

644
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,160
again let me emphasize any data that you
can't review

645
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,470
anywhere for any reason wall ultimately
find its way

646
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:56,640
somewhere else to be used for some other
reason and eventually by me

647
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,640
points to purchase a point to purchase
on one of the

648
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,690
best sources a VIN for about you

649
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,930
and I wanted so you every major retailer

650
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,839
collect this information and does
anything they can

651
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,200
to get you to contribute to this type of
information because

652
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,069
you or ice sales school

653
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:20,339
they want to know who you are they want
to be able to target you

654
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:24,230
they want to be able to sell your info
to somebody else the target market you

655
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:27,900
they want to be able to take that info
match it with other info

656
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,369
have a hugely accurate picture of you
that's why for example if you go to a

657
00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:33,650
supermarket

658
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,030
when you have one of their affinity
cards you get one percent of

659
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,119
all the food you buy which adds up to a
lot of money

660
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,829
do not being nice to you they want to
know your purchases

661
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:51,930
they want to know do you buy 47 cases of
beer a month

662
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,399
because then somebody with perhaps the
twelve-step program is going to market

663
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,819
to you

664
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:00,819
now this is this by the way this by the
way

665
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:03,940
is not fear for example Stop & Shop

666
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,490
Stop & Shop the supermarket chain tested

667
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:12,609
release to prevent a program call smart
mouth

668
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:16,460
and it wouldn't comment on the purchases
history

669
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:20,599
you're buying too much sodium you're
playing too much fat

670
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,180
there was a cop or when it came out that
all the local area HMOs

671
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:28,970
were about to buy these databases and
what was the purpose for

672
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,160
not so they would have your favorite
potato chips in the doctor's office

673
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,460
but if you boil it on a potato chips a
month

674
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,710
your health insurance rates were gonna
go through the roof

675
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,750
you buy a lot a whiny by a lot of
cigarettes you buy a lot of

676
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,220
fatty foods a lot of high so you foods
you are a health risk

677
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:50,530
know by the way that's really true URL
for us

678
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:56,910
that they have a right to know that can
you draw the line a potato chips

679
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:03,910
let's talk about trackers this is scary
scary stuff

680
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:08,190
open to all who are wanna say the

681
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:12,260
for five years ago

682
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,710
I can't find anything I wanted an orange
and I mean anything

683
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:20,200
what can always find out where you

684
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,599
all physically where you or

685
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,770
I've got this enormous dossier on
someone

686
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:32,740
we're here is this person well

687
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:38,190
but ninety percent of the time now you
or index test your location

688
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:41,390
some others can be tracked real time
summer camp

689
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,578
you'll have a cell phone a problem

690
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,020
if it's a gps-enabled cell phone I can
tell almost after the seed that you're

691
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,300
sitting in a room

692
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,940
if it's not a gps-enabled cell phone
here at an urban area

693
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:00,290
absolutely possible to triangulate to
within 150 yards

694
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:03,319
you're serious that's like 50 yards

695
00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:07,490
um if you're talking on the phone
driving through the holland tunnel

696
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:10,760
or removes the whole soul have so all
sorts

697
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,859

698
00:44:14,859 --> 00:44:18,259
where you are in the time how fast you
drive an issue of school site

699
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,650
to sell so hear a song

700
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,550
first the obnoxious but so me know

701
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:31,250
trackers Microsoft has something which
they have not actually called Genuine

702
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,280
Advantage

703
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,280
which is not Windows Genuine Advantage

704
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,069
your computer false hope every time you
use

705
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:43,380
and under Microsoft rules you're not
allowed to disable

706
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,300
I think my laptop I don't want to the
road I check in to the Fairfield Inn

707
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,450
which is not were actually stay I the

708
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:56,700
connect to the wifi they know the hotel
a minute because the IP address

709
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:00,500
because it is contacted as an example

710
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:04,690
I login through a business the a solo

711
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:08,200

712
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,270
a hotspot at a Starbucks they know okay

713
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,640
you know it's it's a cool right around
this time Steve gets his trophy in

714
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,480
churches even know

715
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,099
microsoft knows where you are at all
times if you haven't upgraded version of

716
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:21,520
their windows

717
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,470
and again their their use a license
agreement

718
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,740
their elektronik User License Agreement
which by the way you probably never seen

719
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,559
a red

720
00:45:31,559 --> 00:45:34,730
says you're not allowed to disable no

721
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,880
everybody's all wound evil Bill Gates

722
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,839
my boys at Apple do the same thing if
you use iTunes you have the menu store

723
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:44,980
turned on

724
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:48,670
they know what music you listen to and
where you are when you're listening to

725

real time Windows Media Player

726
00:45:52,839 --> 00:45:58,529
on back to the bay people windows
Windows Media Player has something on it

727
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,940
called the unique player ID which they
had

728
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:06,530
the honestly but the incredible its
protocol super okay

729
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,030
it really is. honestly it's

730
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,280
here's the bottom line though the last
point is the key point

731
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:17,530
anytime that your identity is unknown or

on and soul

739
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:48,260
anytime you in some way authenticate who
you're with a password

740
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:52,559
within a divinity with typeof search
that's gonna reliably connect us

to you we physically know where you are
you doing this all the time

742
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,859
now your cell phone is broadcasting your
location at all times

743
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:04,720
but these are even if you turn off your
cell phone your content with this stuff

744
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,530

car chips all modern car since last year

779
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,819
have little chips in their system that
week or

780
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:25,190
what you've been doing for the past
three hundred hours

781
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,510
whitewater and by the way water cases in
accidents especially DWI DUI accidents

782
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:33,660
the cops pop goes on and

783
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:38,029
all okay the shows that he was traveling
at 75 miles an hour in a residential

784
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:38,990
area

785
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:44,069
and suddenly slammed on his brakes
initial reports

786
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:46,900
digital license plate readers let me
tell you something additional license

787
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,000
plate readers

788
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,740
or now on a Star Trek level a vacuous

789
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:56,770
if there's a camera setup with a twenty
thousand dollar system

790
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,670
that's all the course by the way its
based on a Dell

791
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:05,329
hopefully exploded help but it's based
on a Dell

792
00:50:05,329 --> 00:50:09,990
LAPD for example has now a pilot program

793
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:14,410
where the fish driving around in cars
with his license plate readers running

794
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:17,589
they claim that they're using it for
stolen cars and they have in fact

795
00:50:17,589 --> 00:50:20,609
recovered hundreds of stolen carts

796
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:25,308
they've also as they've been doing that
something to their database

797
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:29,770
I don't launch time and location
everything it's made with the GPS

798
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,799
so as they drive down see down the
street

799
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:36,390
every permanent database record a very
poor parked on the street

800
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:39,770
every car that drives into the camera's
viewfinder

801
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:42,790
where it was and what time it was there

802
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:46,210
technology this is not a fitness

803
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:49,849
the technology exists to walk your car's
location

804
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:54,650
24/7 anywhere there's a camera phone

805
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:59,579
we discuss cell phone activity wifi
actively wifi activity says

806
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:05,609
I am so-and-so I'm using such as such a
device a internet phone a

807
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:09,210
WiFi enabled laptops something and I am
should

808
00:51:09,210 --> 00:51:12,819
typically I'm with you story meters

809
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:16,390
up this particular location

810
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:19,730
cell phone pink

811
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:23,190
your tracking cell phones is not Jost

812
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:27,130
the fed's anymore there are services
that offer this commercial

813
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,369
if you give your your cell phone nearly
every major carrier allows you to turn

814
00:51:31,369 --> 00:51:32,640
on a track in future

815
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,710
where you can pull up a webpage in your
locker searches think

816
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,010
forty times a day you know beyond that
your

817
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:45,010
maybe I mean these in Chino arrival of
find friends mobile

818
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:49,339
angel traceable there are services that
aren't there are made available to

819
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:50,930
companies know

820
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,819
any soul for your company plan you can
tell

821
00:51:54,819 --> 00:51:58,259
where fred is no we had tacos in a
second

822
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,630
about GPS location

823
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:05,829
it's now possible through cross
referencing GPS

824
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:11,309
and mapping to tell not only were person
is for example that he is

825
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:14,829
on River Street between 5th and searched

826
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:19,680
but what's at River Street between 5th
and 6th

827
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,619
is you know ball is he a strip joint

828
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:26,690

829
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,970

830
00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:36,520
what's at the location where this
individual lives

831
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,240
companies know this is this is from a
marketing magazine

832
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:45,119
so most have you have never looked at it
frankly i retarded marketing every month

833
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,490
because it gives me some of my best
database sources these are the people

834
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,220
who want to be able to count heads

835
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,579
know who you are and what you like and
so on and so forth

836
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:58,880
uses a using its first

837
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,710
here's a parking garage who's online
store they have

838
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:06,140
every location mapped in detail no by
the way

839
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:10,290
on on a walk slightly lower level if you
buy

840
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:13,308
in for USA which is probably one of the
biggest privacy

841
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:17,690
errors in america if you buy in for
USA's

842
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,540
map it DVD you know every single
business

843
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,609
in America on it you can

844
00:53:24,609 --> 00:53:28,910
you can this is not some major

845
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:32,720
governmental agency or corporation you
can with the laptop

846
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,270
drive down the street plugin what you're
looking for people take the GPS

847
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,859
will see a location is shown on a map
you type in

848
00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:46,410
pizza store or pizza and it will pop up
another blinking point

849
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,490
where the New Years Pizza stores and
I'll show you how to get there

850
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:55,250
so you can buy a database that's a
medially available to you anytime you

851
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,030
want

852
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:00,369
that shows everything every location

853
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:04,430
MapQuest now has find me now as an
example

854
00:54:04,430 --> 00:54:07,480
no question answers

855
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:11,359
I think do we have to change the tape in
five minutes

856
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:14,480
okay there recording this we're gonna
take

857
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,539
do it quickly we're gonna change the
table then
