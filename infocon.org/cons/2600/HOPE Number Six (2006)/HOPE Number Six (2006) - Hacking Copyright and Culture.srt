1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,290
Paris arts are the techno the
difficulties

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,880
um so as you can see that's a name like
presentation um

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,879
apologize for the you know slideshow
stuff but I found it actually

4
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:14,179
works pretty well in these situations so
our

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:16,840
I did talk about there'll be three
sections to this one's going to become

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,050
the anecdotal thing

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,500
and eternal art history and i wanna talk
about the free culture movement

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,990
term pardo arm first thing is a

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,880
all you guys know this is because the
caption but this is a %uh Steve

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,619
Wozniak's

11
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,109
blue box he made blue boxes back in the
day

12
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:39,300
in early nineteen seventies 1973 and 74
even Steve Jobs hang out in california

13
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,809
on

14
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,218
got kinda on the Boxwave and in case you
don't know that's what 2600 named after

15
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,280
the town that a blue box generates arm

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:53,140
a spare the technical details but
essentially generates a tone that well

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,969
back in the day

18
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:57,719
they make free long distance call years
of us anyway it's on display at the

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:00:58,559
computer museum

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,679
I think the computer museum must be in
Germany I'm not sure which one

21
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,840
this is on the computer on to call for
up there's a photo

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,189
steve wozniak using a boombox there's
him and Steve Jobs

23
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,219
Steve Jobs up was there

24
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:16,119
so here steve jobs now doesn't look
similar

25
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:19,509
um got a huge corporate logo behind them

26
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:23,619
and up getting to be on the wealthiest
man or

27
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:27,590
so arm here's

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,880
apple computer I'll just before they
start apple computer Steve Jobs

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,630
and Steve Wozniak went to business
selling blue boxes to people in the Bay

30
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,149
Area

31
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,590
and that didn't work out so well so they
decide to start

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,640
selling a home where computers that's
what led to Apple one

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,060
noble to but now this is the new face a
valuable

34
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,399
are the harbor school and fashionable
and stuff but

35
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,549
everyone knows them for the iPod's at
this point and

36
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:56,079
consequently everyone knows and because
their DRM on

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,210
Apple's the largest the RAM retailer in
the world

38
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,179
now how does Apple in 1970

39
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,729
with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak taking
apart

40
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,919
phones and using blue boxes come to be
either largest

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,269
your am retail world that's our question
and answer

42
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:18,300
no I'm not so much interested in steve
Jobs was

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,760
a personal history and what led him to
this decision but

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,950
I am interested in the fact that the RAM
and kind of copyright control our

45
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,500
culture

46
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,680
so arm as level we know but

47
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,510
or a lot of people don't know that
Apple's first logo is this are

48
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,030
pretty ugly well look good I back on
ipod now

49
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,650
or computer or anything for that matter
doesn't look good but the interesting

50
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,190
part

51
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,400
is that the guy under the tree is Isaac
Newton and I'll

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,989
most people work with computers are
physics or something are

53
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,680
any anybody besides world of course
knows who he is but respect them

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,739
because it is kinda progressive thought
on how

55
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:59,019
he did his work and how other people
that is work and means famous for saying

56
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:02,280
effacing further it by saying I feel
that the Giants

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,790
interesting part about this that he
actually say this isn't it this is in

58
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,390
his first

59
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,409
this isn't his he was this is an
original if you took it from

60
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,859
burn our from John assaults for Salsberg

61
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,659
rodent 159 for four years before noon
was around on

62
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:22,879
a statement pretty much the same um

63
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,429
we like the same so much that we put on
the back burner T-shirts the one where

64
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,010
now are on the left next to that such a
thorn in my pants

65
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,298
standing in Newnan are is the quote from
before

66
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,439
a that if I'd seen farther is by
standing on the shoulders of giants so

67
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:40,828
what does this mean this means that

68
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:44,239
noon accepted the fact that he didn't
have that my i mean

69
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,590
ironically he did he was one the most
kind of um

70
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,879
prolific scientist at this time but but
few realize that you could have gone

71
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,649
anywhere if that people before him

72
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,870
and contributed something and let it out
into the field so

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,329
you wrote this this is a letter to
Robert Koch who happen to be short so

74
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:04,680
was when does come in and saw but I

75
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,599
now people like the bat around that
people like me like about around that

76
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,349
quote as

77
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,709
indication that Culture and Science in

78
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,070
noonan's case doesn't progress unless
you have access to the past and so is

79
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,418
the

80
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,789
this is the theme kinda my talking what
I'm interested in

81
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,169
is that copyright is always gonna be in
that

82
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,469
this tension with letting people have
access to things that so

83
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,500
those kinda by anecdotal

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,530
story on figure introduce but

85
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,440
at the heart of it copying is inherent
to creation brothers

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,169
whether a hacker artist you're using
something that somebody did before

87
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,580
and copyright as it stands now and as a
will be

88
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,758
on in you know hundred years ago or so

89
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,949
stand against that they don't want you
to copy

90
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,740
it US government in and most other
civilized societies but

91
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,729
limited naw monopolies in hand the
people who have created things before

92
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:00,320
them

93
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,969
a four-year so and then those people can
dictate whether or not you can use

94
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,160
their creations runs for covered

95
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
but is interesting that you is a Greek
or Roman

96
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,289
the statue itself i think is roaming but
it's from a great met

97
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,620
this is in the classical buried in Roman
civilization when they start

98
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,479
realizing that these groups know what
they're doing point as

99
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,560
the Romans that have work elements that

100
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,340
I'll before room but

101
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,039
but after the XO yeah I I'd rather as I
can remember helmet stickers

102
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,389
before/after comment anyway appointed as
the Romans the side that the Greeks know

103
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:42,160
what they're doing and decide me a copy
of it for themselves

104
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,400
and most Roman art that you see now is

105
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,690
based on some Greek art so this idea of
copying what be

106
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:52,150
what came before you in order kinda make
something significant

107
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,310
and culturally valid has been around
since

108
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,300
human creation has been around I mean
obviously there's a lot more human

109
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,620
creation before this

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,220
but I'll this in the Vatican on a great
school

111
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,069
op so another great thing

112
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,819
that combines kinda artists and hackers
I think is that

113
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,410
we both have I mean I'm consider myself
an artist but

114
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,900
actors and artists both have a distinct
desire to subvert the status quo

115
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,210
in in that artists what makes them
contemporary invalid in

116
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,159
and kinda interesting to people is that
they've done something that nobody else

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,789
before

118
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,789
stuff and that's the central Africa
Pakistan

119
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,099
at the heart of it you're just wanting
to one-up the guy

120
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,500
before you and so art works like that to
you

121
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,280
and and there's no real reason to see
such a distinct line between how hackers

122
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,289
work

123
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:44,539
artists work I think are

124
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:49,130
the painting by Ivan law I can't
pronounce on French because im

125
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,190
you your life but I've its OVA

126
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,699
kinda party industry but here's a quote
from art me know dot com

127
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,300
about what the impressionists what
people thought of them presence at the

128
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,870
time

129
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,319
this is to give me an idea that they
were China's you know they cause

130
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,490
great offense but I'm are in the
beginning the Impressionist painters

131
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,160
were nothing but

132
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,270
ridiculed by the public our critic's all
the paintings unfinished in the clear

133
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,650
the artist as Mad Men

134
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,539
newspaper cartoons pregnant women were
or not to enter impressionist

135
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:20,599
art exhibition because of the danger a
miscarriage the caricatures that was

136
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,530
proposed to fend off the Prussian army

137
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,770
was marching towards Paris in 1870 by
showing them freshness innings

138
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,120
so thought they had you know like this
looks like a

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,599
kinda stuffy old painting to us but at
the time this blue people's minds

140
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,979
the that you bother to be non figured
and kind of

141
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:40,310
impressionists was used as an insult at
the time um

142
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,660
was was too much for people to handle
but you now these

143
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,690
sell for millions dollars these are part
of our culture part over history

144
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,719
so I find a lot of

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,180
I'll a lot of the motivations

146
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,650
artists in the past if we just look back
have examine what

147
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,710
what angle they're coming from are
similar the way hackers operate in terms

148
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:02,020
of creating something new

149
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,628
from what's been before and and and can
have

150
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,789
putting a new light on the world for
people so

151
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:12,940
part of this whole talk is for me to
appeal the hacker community

152
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,270
and show you that copyright the thing
that mandating controls these things

153
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,349
is an important part love your world and
my world too and that we have to

154
00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:26,280
have we have to have moreover

155
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,550
dialogue going and arm

156
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,570
10 biggest point i think is that hackers

157
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:36,300
are just like artists an artist just
like hackers reuse

158
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:39,920
beautiful technology to create something
new I mean how often have you just

159
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,809
rejected

160
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:44,550
you know wire or program and just alter

161
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,740
input or argument and its totally change
the Athens and the program essentially

162
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,460
or

163
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,860
you know some small subverting this is
what this is actually the

164
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,980
kinda largest the move by my argument
about

165
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,560
are impacting um is what modern art been
doing in this is one

166
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,960
most significant this is considered I
think the most significant piece modern

167
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,830
art but

168
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,210
you know people or are you about that
cool November on the books but

169
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,930
arm is more solstice Marcel Duchamp's
Fountain

170
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,600
on essentially took a public urinal and
put on display

171
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,720
and gallery in Paris in this blue
everyone's mind I'm sorry from boring is

172
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,540
sorry for the story but are decided
under a different name because he was

173
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,930
crazy like that and %ah this cause
another up

174
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,300
out or a bridge so

175
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,660
um that's just one example on the people
just can't handle that you put a

176
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,150
Toyota museum or not even a fun thing

177
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,900
well using so um I fine

178
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,209
marceau Marcel Duchamp's gonna
motivation behind this very similar to

179
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,440
how hackers operating

180
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,460
creating are nuclear programs are

181
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,880
Apple tour the same deal I mean you know
this is lying around

182
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,480
shelves I've everywhere convenience
store in america

183
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,580
and one artist Andy Warhol decide to
take it into

184
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,710
and taken into something larger and he

185
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:08,870
by putting it under a canvas display
that

186
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,140
you know it these consumer are objects
can actually function as r2

187
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,270
so its it's really just a memory
contextualization

188
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:20,000
for Andy are for Andy Warhol but it's
also a matter

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,020
love reusing something from the past F
campus when after and if they did

190
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,230
if they contacted and I thought this is
a great way to promote the product

191
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,810
but they went after him this this whole
theme of Pop or

192
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,280
may not happen now in now

193
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,439
copyright is becoming more hurtful to
prevent people like

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,060
Andy from creating so I'm gonna go to
one last example for

195
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,680
and support you probably haven't heard
of and us by artist and Cory Arcangel

196
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,200
and I he basically remixes Mario

197
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,450
and are remixes video games and and
among other things this is someone who

198
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,260
is all there are in 2003

199
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,850
but as you can see the right to talk
Mario

200
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,060
out of Mario just left the clouds and
our

201
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,120
I was gonna try to set up emulator and
play for you is a

202
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,790
runs a bill was passed down but are at
the clauses go buy music place

203
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:16,089
kinda cool but this is to me a great
example perfect synthesis and the idea

204
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:18,160
of hacking art together

205
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,939
where an artist is reusing something
from the past summit copyrighted

206
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,680
something that

207
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,770
some to pay for there's a copy made up
and

208
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:30,290
turning into something that really
challenges our perspective on how r

209
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,650
and you know I mean people talk about
how your thoughts about her childhood

210
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,640
and how

211
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,710
these icons have pop imager similar what

212
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,050
we're all used in i mean there's you can
talk lot about

213
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,080
how arm

214
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,310
reuse of cultural icons are important in
our

215
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,630
arm but that's all I'll say that these
are

216
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,580
now possible with the to increasing

217
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:00,080
copyright a regime in this country it's
not clear that people continue to be

218
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:00,630
able

219
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,660
make art and program like yourselves so
that leads me to

220
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:08,430
the story about free calls for a 40 talk
about this I'll tell you how I got

221
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,230
involved

222
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,670
I'll I was reading the 2600 are

223
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,910
summer issue like 1990 eight or
something it was

224
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,020
my first issues were a they got
frightened by the MPAA for publishing a

225
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,380
DCS

226
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,060
and after that I read that it kinda
Upton said interested in covering

227
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,750
Slashdot involve the case

228
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,860
actually want to appeal when they lost
the case in suit again

229
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,180
or peeled on in New York in hours
uniform if point for me

230
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,840
when I realized that this law called the
DMCA was really strong stuff up

231
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,920
online for people I'll way realizes how

232
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,439
significant there is a world power was
are a couple

233
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,230
couple years later Lawrence Lessig was
working a book on Fri culture

234
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,260
when awesome memos from the deep ball
corporation got leaked onto the internet

235
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,510
yes familiar with that mean you heard
about that are

236
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,710
basically a bunch of internal memos got
leaked that were

237
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,530
displayed people their particular bad
light if I remember correctly they

238
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,350
admitted that the borders reselling it
state of California

239
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,810
broken voting machines among other
things but the members are millions of

240
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,360
pages

241
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,640
and arm in order parts them properly

242
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,830
people just decided near them on the
website so that the public after

243
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,560
so arm is kinda like a cat out the bag
thing like once it happened

244
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,680
members were but are doesn't have lost
me

245
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,730
on the right on the left and SAR arm

246
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,320
was part of a anti-war or

247
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,180
group on campus at swarthmore and figure
that this was an interesting case

248
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,890
against the bush administration

249
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:41,510
so Nelson and his friend posted the
people memos and theres of more

250
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,960
accounts which is like 10 megabytes you
address and

251
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,290
arm sure nothing I cease and desist
letter from the mall

252
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:52,060
claiming copyright infringement is going
crazy because deval the left the memos

253
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,440
ok

254
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,310
in a open public FTP and just they like
forgot password

255
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,310
something is fully ridiculous and the
claim that

256
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:03,550
the only reason people weren't allowed
to distribute them was copyright was a

257
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,860
was a pretty bogus claim so before

258
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,090
they actually soon yeltsin and they did

259
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,920
Nelson got together and with Lawrence
Lessig and a side issue Diebel

260
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,450
first for bees copyright they won that
case in its star

261
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,480
at Star this huge national kind of
commotion around swarthmore campus and

262
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,520
it became kind of figures for arm
blessings

263
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,620
the kind of extension of us a good idea
the book that is published Fri culture

264
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,460
you haven't read for culture is it just
you are check it out you can download it

265
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,490
for free its licensed under Creative
Commons license online

266
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,230
get a free dash culture .cc you can
download the whole book

267
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,550
are you buy and stores I think it's in
its fourth printing now

268
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,440
are so nelson et start something called
the swap or coalition for the

269
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,380
Digital Commons and on as cover already
title and

270
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,560
once again I realize there's so much
national attention about this

271
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,600
one topic that had to do with this you
know Republican corporation abusing

272
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,470
copyright

273
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,050
he job decide to make it larger so with
a couple friends a surfer cultured or

274
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,530
which was gonna be a national student
movement about this because

275
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:11,180
I'll not only was the bold interesting
case for college students but

276
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,760
on divorced on OBC about our and that
was

277
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,160
getting attention so that summer

278
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,339
I got in contact with God Nelson gonna
sit on the analysts and

279
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,160
and arm previously I as a perforce prank

280
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:29,480
for summer 2000 are the spring of 2004

281
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,860
at the posters on my on NYU's campus
saying I

282
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,490
that are a was coming to campus and you
can meet Hilary Rosen and Metallica

283
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,960
and if you brought a CD with your mp3's
on it you could trade it in for immunity

284
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,510
in future are a lawsuit's

285
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,510
I was at the post now but it's on this
laptop but I looked really official and

286
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,900
what we put all these are

287
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,350
but like the date and name we did like
people 31st in like

288
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,670
you know 1 p.m. to noon always like
times it didn't make any sense that you

289
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:58,230
can actually

290
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,390
go anywhere do it we splattered all over
campus in

291
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:05,080
we just thought were being funny we did
at like 5am you know morning before

292
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,330
april fools

293
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,640
and we go to forget about it this is my
roommate and I and then like a week or

294
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,130
two later we hear these people getting

295
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,090
argument in the stairwell in our dorm
dislike sure it is argued about whether

296
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,640
out RA was justified in throwing people

297
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,120
and goes all over the city today for
full sprint but it was like

298
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,950
you know that we kept on hearing about
it and we're like wallace actually you

299
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,770
know people talking about this on campus
I thought that they're just afraid it's

300
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:27,140
a

301
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,069
they feel like the IRA is a is in a
morally unjustifiable position

302
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,440
and doing college students and I was
like I thought this way all along I mean

303
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,560
I fall the DCSS case

304
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,290
you know whatever's happening at the
time and especially the deep okay so I

305
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:40,870
was like

306
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,680
now's the time like I I should start a
club or something I start a club in high

307
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,190
school

308
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,450
like this thank you some college campus
but I can make a political

309
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,810
so I got in contact and the saw your my
senior year

310
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,100
on 2005 arms are 2004-2005 assert for
culture W

311
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,960
arm graduated and then I kinda stuck
around the city and became outside

312
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,950
agitator

313
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,740
hand we started out when my ideas was to
have a DRM protest

314
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,980
so this is the first year and protest
ever as far as I

315
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,150
I'll and we made poster boards and
sandwich boards

316
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,770
and on funny things into showed up a
virgin images of fires which of the 10

317
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:22,900
later that arm

318
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,920
explain what the ram was essentially how
and how to damage your computer and

319
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,650
house

320
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,110
problematic for arm

321
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,290
you know your rights as a as a copy
realities

322
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,450
are your rights as a consumer arm

323
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,820
essentially you guys on your stand the
problem here and it's only there to

324
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,860
prevent you from taking

325
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,940
copying bring iPod itself you wanna
remix

326
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,380
and actually create something new with
that CD it will prevent you from doing

327
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,780
that

328
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,230
and to break that duran is it the NCAA
violations so

329
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,700
if you're somebody who wants a remix
jay-z for example

330
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,200
right in that city has dear mr.

331
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,430
ten years ago or five years ago even 4dr
I'm really existed

332
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,220
you could copy the whole city under
computer maker remix

333
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,450
and then disperse it onto the web hoping
that its

334
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,290
fair use and and that that's its own is
to mean for uses its own problem but you

335
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,250
would actually be

336
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,550
violating any laws by getting

337
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,440
getting the songs on your computer
remixing now do your own

338
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,020
presents a problem in that in the way
that

339
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,590
it it is a violation a plea brakeman a
break the RAM

340
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,740
the DMZ but I'll so is covering up with
a lot of attention for this week on

341
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,830
Boing Boing

342
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,189
are and random people to show up was
phenomenal actually people set up their

343
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,190
own posters answered

344
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,700
any analysis is kinda you know internet
meets

345
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,490
real-world feeling you get every so
often but

346
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,740
it was especially kinda exciting to see
people who

347
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,070
knew about the issues and just want to
do something in New York about so

348
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:02,419
arm we on the opening of fires inside
the store in a virgin people were like

349
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,430
what's the Euro

350
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:08,670
somewhere you know we 5 and because
everyone just goes in Virginia in square

351
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,710
in the stanza

352
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,310
your put flyers and it's just like a %um
my will be a public space to the P the

353
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,210
clerk for just like whatever but

354
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,860
are a lot of people mister like this is
really interesting we actually got no

355
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,700
negative

356
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,350
like feedback but nobody was actually
you know you kids you're downloading we

357
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,900
got one person that after explaining the
whole thing he was like water

358
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,820
her I think the record companies need to
you to keep the revenues but

359
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,679
it wasn't that somebody there was no
protest in that there is somebody

360
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,130
sitting in virgin who actively disagreed

361
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,780
with us so we call that moreover
demonstration that we're really just

362
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,139
informing consumers not to buy these

363
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,970
essentially broken product that was the
theme of our flyer are you buying damage

364
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,680
CD

365
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,090
so there's some photos from that are
wrong way

366
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,929
up so here's this parts in the second 1i
a pulse photos

367
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,200
people larger um and the original
sandwich board reared had

368
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,120
throwing up iPod I really sec iPod in
that you can get a

369
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,370
you know your sister iPods here I was
upset

370
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:12,620
on he River throwing up computer because
this is

371
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,680
we got really lucky and between a first
for tests are second protest is the Sony

372
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,540
BMG scandal

373
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,460
where there are essentially release the
virus and the public

374
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,570
hand it was a rootkit but a you know

375
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:28,899
most people understand that has a virus
and

376
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,450
a there it was just this hot moment this
hot flashes

377
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,980
Deron gonna interest um by the public so

378
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,230
we made her sandwich portable computer
throwing up you can see them

379
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,030
upper left and a we're actually
fortunate Richard Stallman was in the

380
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,700
city and had heard about this and I
didn't

381
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,840
emailing back and forth that you want to
come housing sir

382
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,970
why not so he just grabbed a sandwich
board heart the entire night

383
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:56,430
and on the front of it we had their old
compact disc logo which is that

384
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,620
which actually means the sea is redbook
certified

385
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,430
on Andy RAM cities not that so they're
like imposter sees

386
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,940
it's actually really interesting so they
have this other logo which is that kinda

387
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,870
see with the triangle and I'll another
see which means content protection or

388
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,640
something

389
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:17,530
and I'll so if you ever see that log
don't quite see obviously but we made a

390
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,879
sandwich board the kind of demonstrate
the difference to consumers

391
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,030
um interesting part is that one of my
friends had

392
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,389
went in and bought this Sony BMG the van
Zante CD

393
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,600
at the Tower protesting just in case

394
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,780
we got a question about it and arm

395
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:37,399
turn let later that evening the manager
the store comes out and he knows we're

396
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,760
talking about obviously he's like we're
not selling

397
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,340
cities and he certainly has trouble is
required to go to Virginia like

398
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,050
did them last month man I mean we're
just which is making the rounds it's not

399
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:47,889
like we're

400
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,570
no finding you in particular and
hassling you in

401
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,629
knees you know he's hemming and hawing
is that I don't like this either because

402
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,660
again we turn in this whole thing but
for the record companies are doing what

403
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,760
you know the hardcore

404
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,890
headquarters and I was like role
honestly we don't care about converting

405
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:02,730
a buncha

406
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,820
monkeys in suits I mean their jobs are
absolutely in

407
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,060
10 years anyway you know like people
like us to go

408
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,510
used to go and buy CDs are the ones
you're care about this and

409
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,629
obviously our target in this action arm

410
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:18,940
so then finally he's like we're not
selling that CD or like yes you are my

411
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,170
friend takes that CD in the receipt if I

412
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,970
you know hour before and that such a
goober the store manager on upper right

413
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,580
holding the CD looking are are now

414
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,699
for Mike's arm so

415
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,770
there's a group shot at Cecils for is a
a great guy

416
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,870
I'll that was a really fun night and

417
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,930
that was the second year in protest over
weekend like

418
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,480
haven't heard anybody doing anything
else in we made all the Flyers available

419
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,990
online

420
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,000
some people showed up arm if you're free
to protest

421
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,250
Union Square is really good for it and a
corner of West 4th Street and Broadway

422
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,410
isn't so good for it's like really windy
and if you doing at like 7pm or

423
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,170
something

424
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:00,450
its it's just kinda Cole and

425
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,490
and November are scupper

426
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,970
Armada we're good plan to do some during
the day

427
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,010
at the Sony headquarters on and I think
we may do that next year

428
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,530
I'm so this is really exciting thing in
and eventually I'll

429
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,690
enough people can contact here's a
here's the fire this is the original

430
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,670
fire

431
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,200
on so it's really simple we had a lot of
criticism from people in the tech world

432
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,060
that you're like

433
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,480
you're not explaining the at you know
the the CD install software her

434
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,720
it's like you can't really part the
people just walk around the street can't

435
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,120
parse that kind of information

436
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,370
quickly like like I mean its kinda
second nature for people like us but

437
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,960
but when your hands me a flyer first
they think you're selling something

438
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,770
and second i wanna talk to you so so
trying to explain that there's these

439
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,200
like

440
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,070
obtuse technical details about the
format CD is just gonna go over your

441
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,760
head you need to explain in terms that
they really understand

442
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,350
and that's can't play it on your home
computer mercies have this problem last

443
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,800
year

444
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,940
cities have this problem you can't for
the songs on your mp3 player

445
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,630
1 I've Apple's big advertising campaigns
was that they were

446
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,120
letting you can for your collection from
CDs

447
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,940
to your iTunes collection and they can I
stop talking about that once they start

448
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,620
selling the iran because

449
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,120
Apple fall people doesn't like the idea
for Mac shipping they don't want you to

450
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,070
be able to shift from

451
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,389
iTunes to your iPod to your city and
then tear

452
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,590
you know home mp3 server they want to be
stuck with

453
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:30,480
iTunes approve John so

454
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,440
those one thing we can explain very
easily and then making a backup copy the

455
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,040
CD

456
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,040
some love the Europe's offer would kind
of

457
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,170
tangentially let you do this but it
would be like a 120 kill a bit version

458
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,240
the whole CD which is far below senior
Quality Inn

459
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,880
on they're wrong let you make three or
four copies

460
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,090
or maybe even one copy are so we can add
a checklist and then we set up a web

461
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,230
page that was kind of like a resource
for people to understand more about the

462
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,870
RAM

463
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,940
so this is just like a really simple and
flyering

464
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,400
we headed out like a thousand these the
first night and they want like

465
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,120
littering so wheat we took we made on
assumption that people working at home

466
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,880
um the second one we made like a
full-page fire

467
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,010
because we had so much to talk about the
Sony BMG stuff I'll

468
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:19,020
and we put the logo on there which is
really important are

469
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,780
and and just like some quote from the
new york times and so people who were

470
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,750
be serious um all these are online
available for download so if you want

471
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,200
your own

472
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,890
your protests are licensed under
Creative Commons are you care

473
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:33,890
you just do whatever you want with the
stuff I mean the probably

474
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,000
typos and stuff unfortunately the their
original files are in PSD

475
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,100
they do it again on public put him in a
more open format

476
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,900
arm but our yeah he's really useful
people got it people loved

477
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,570
I stalk let the stalking us on the
street is random consumers a

478
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,429
you get the idea that most people have
no idea about these

479
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,600
things but once you actually stop months
ago actually there

480
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,590
they want to talk to you about and and
they're interested so people pretty

481
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,059
smart

482
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,080
and we found that to be the case so
here's a article the village voice heard

483
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,909
about it

484
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,710
on that was really this is a really
interesting story on my friend inga

485
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,059
who funded for culture don't want you
with me on the

486
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,720
left there arm is quoted in this article
are the tickets on

487
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,059
here okay here she says

488
00:26:20,059 --> 00:26:23,100
if there are laws i believe are wrong I
will break them

489
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,570
at the time she was working in our
trademark I'll law firm

490
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,679
I was really pretty just one in Midtown
and it took a couple weeks before

491
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,580
summoning office found this article

492
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,050
and on your column in the HR and

493
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,139
they told her you basically can't work
here because you're opposed to what we

494
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,000
do

495
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,050
and in your anything as a sophomore in
college and

496
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,050
his interest in copyright and how these
things are affecting

497
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:50,190
you know computers and technology in

498
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,890
and culture and economists economics in
general

499
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,809
arm this year job as a paralegal shoes
she want to go to law school in fact

500
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,639
she's applying the law school right now

501
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,690
arm so getting a job as a paralegal what
you do but it doesn't come to prohibit

502
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,510
you from being

503
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,770
a political paralegal if you're not at
work so

504
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,790
the firm care that like at this
wishy-washy

505
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:14,430
thing that we're not firing you for your
views but we are firing you because what

506
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,520
you believe in and then it's like that
same thing assholes

507
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,030
a home tho so ago I wrote

508
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,220
arm so I was looking at this is a big
deal she's like no it's not and she was

509
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,330
really upset in CA

510
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:30,500
you know a person X that you get the job
but that was the problem she was just

511
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:30,760
like

512
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,730
I you know I I don't like having like a
black mark on my resume I was like no

513
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,720
you care thinking this is a black mark
this is awesome this is drawing a line

514
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,679
in the sand

515
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
for people out there to understand what
dear is what you know what the problems

516
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,340
are copyright or so

517
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,120
as like we gotta go public with this so
fortunately we had the advice from a pro

518
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,170
bono lawyer

519
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,030
and she can have step sister as I can
probably don't want to name the name law

520
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,820
firm

521
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,320
arm so don't ask on but you're welcome
to share your story

522
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,189
are so in your right up this long letter
about it it's on our web page if you

523
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,120
wanna go free culture and why you dont
or

524
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,050
just explain what happened pretty much
what I just told you and that

525
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:11,500
years she finds it unfortunate that a
law firm so short-sighted and

526
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,690
like this very kind of like formal
apology and we surpassing around him

527
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:20,010
every lawyer we talk to was Kevin raged
about this and they're like this is

528
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,679
you're doing exactly the right thing

529
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,890
on and so on america's on Slashdot and
it's like

530
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,540
by what for culture and where you got
like twenty thousand hits in one day

531
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,990
and there's this huge threat on Slashdot
about people are going over whether or

532
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:32,290
not

533
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,530
Angus quote there was something to be
fired over but the important point was

534
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,520
that it

535
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,809
establish some precedent that if you're
gonna be

536
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,620
involved to help our law firm you can
worry about

537
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,630
what your political views on BRM are
enhance that's a really funny thing I

538
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,880
mean how you feel about some technology

539
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,280
is is is the interesting thing to be

540
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,350
call to qualify your ability to work at
a law firm

541
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,220
so I was interesting article arm

542
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,650
washings were news we were a with a
friend we

543
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,809
we collaborate a road op-ed and it's got
out a lot of people

544
00:29:07,809 --> 00:29:11,820
this is on my way couple times and just
on campus

545
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,030
if you're thinking about doing campus
organizing or Paul

546
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:19,040
poll politicizing that kind of thing
your op-ed column in your

547
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,330
and your papers a really good way to get
things started I mean really doesn't

548
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,149
require much to

549
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:26,370
read a couple hundred words about
something you care about and

550
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,630
trusting college papers are star for
interesting things

551
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,610
talk about especially technology 0

552
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,840
USA today we're going contact with us
into the whole article this is

553
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,150
in the man section of USA today and
that's my friend Diana rosenthal

554
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,240
well with the iPod from NYU bus they
said she said it took like all night to

555
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,350
get that one photo

556
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,309
500 shops and USA today it was

557
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:55,120
their discover you know they're good but
didn't wanna the

558
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,070
been care about like the actual politics
ovett they just want to hear

559
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:02,428
about how you can turn CDs and iPod

560
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:05,850
files and it was kinda frustrating as

561
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,020
we are trying to tell them that there is
a significant

562
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,889
political party how these files work
what was happening with the CDs and

563
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,559
they're just

564
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:17,520
concerned about poor college students
getting ripped off on

565
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,740
which is a part of our message but it's
our our message

566
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,679
okay so um move other vans we did

567
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,530
was a Creative Commons archer yes from
lawyers Creative Commons

568
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:33,020
are basically it's that time too do open
source for

569
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,290
I'm do licensing for culture on the GP
only

570
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:40,350
are did you kill me if I saw for there's
FTL that applies for

571
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,030
are suffer males are that was designed
for saw for man of

572
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,820
but really there's no good way to
license your work said

573
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:51,659
in order let other people know that you
want them to share henry's

574
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:55,429
so part of our goal the call was to
kinda advocate Creative Commons

575
00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:59,040
on campus in on in any way we could so

576
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,299
we decide to host a critic comment
archer and we basically just bought a

577
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,549
bunch of our friends for

578
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:07,830
files for for photos or other art that
they would like to licensed under

579
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,879
Creative Commons

580
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,040
that we would then put online the same
time

581
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:15,309
as doing physical archer we told them
that their as long as they brought their

582
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,379
own friends and friend

583
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:20,100
themselves there for sale at whatever
price they wanted to

584
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,650
can have and Kurds the fact that there
can be real world analogues

585
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,940
to you kinda digital world stop even if
you're giving out something for free

586
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,220
online it doesn't mean that

587
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,090
original proprietary version in the
physical world costs anything

588
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:36,520
are can cost with its ok this weather
works

589
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,629
are if there's more I hear some more

590
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,700
there are just you know good work that
ever you know from the friends and

591
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,460
people who are

592
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,080
licensing under Creative Commons are we
just kind of set our

593
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,939
feelers and got enough feedback and were
able to slide maybe 10 or 11

594
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,640
great pieces are two years I in our show

595
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,929
pairs of this is diana's case up

596
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:02,000
she was the girl yes it's there

597
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,260
because she's also a photographer arm
this is my friend will chairman

598
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,280
he runs the site untitled name dot com I

599
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,010
its he does mostly graffiti stuff but
this I P sed

600
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:18,090
in Red Hook are the licenses his work
under Creative Commons already so we can

601
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,980
have to explain it to him was really
interesting experience talking college

602
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,910
students because

603
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,350
most them understand the copyright isn't
working on

604
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,670
on internet & digital media and there's
no way

605
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:33,720
to really on keep control for work want
to put it out there so

606
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,490
a lot of them really amenable Creative
Commons in a row like the idea that

607
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:41,110
they could kind of get some publicity
through their name

608
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,260
and not have to worry about like

609
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,140
you know all the problems entailed with
putting things on line in new features

610
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,850
like a

611
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,040
you know attribution-noncommercial
license they could have some legal

612
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,940
recourse if that's all their photo

613
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,900
and up and some Ford commercial or
something like that

614
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,780
are are some more photos is was the one
that got kinda picked up by the media

615
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,260
this is our blogs is being kinda like

616
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,429
there's a free art opening are you go to
it

617
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:12,179
their kids with guns on is actually 10

618
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:15,490
this the photographers brothers and are

619
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,380
Minnesota think this is what they do
this thing out issue

620
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,760
rounds I guess um but our yeah it was
calls were released

621
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,179
we had a party at NYU and then released
all stuff online at the same time on

622
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:28,950
Flickr

623
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,990
under Creative Commons license and kinda
made sure everyone knew that

624
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,230
so her systems photos a we decide to do
it at a student lounge

625
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,090
we like the idea of having our meeting
still out as opposed to cause of room

626
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:40,960
just kinda

627
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,559
church people show up and drop in that
kind of thing on

628
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,200
and it was a firm on and we got a lot or
great responses

629
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,350
um was even better was that arm

630
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:55,740
Creek Commons and Second Life decide to
do up

631
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,440
art show in Second Life so they can have

632
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,740
gave us free space and Second Life which
actually cost something

633
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,900
leader not and are yes from lawyers
Second Life its

634
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,440
it's a online world not a game on

635
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,700
where where people can have created
everything themselves

636
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,419
the only real things created by Second
Life the company

637
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:20,679
are the tools to create other objects so
everything you see here is user-created

638
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,530
aside from maybe the ocean

639
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,679
and shading on sky arm my shirt

640
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,950
is actually the virtual version my shirt
on

641
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:32,149
so we can go online art show and I also
gave a talk

642
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:36,080
and Second Life about it posing callers
that we then encourage everyone in

643
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,129
Second Life

644
00:34:37,129 --> 00:34:40,389
to go on remix art that could mean it's
the stuff that wasn't under

645
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,780
and no difference license so is just one
example

646
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,669
I'll what so many did with it his clean
bill the scene

647
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,549
from a taxicab thing made it seem like
he was hailing a cab

648
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,980
and then turn this into a piece of work
that he did relicensed under

649
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,150
Creative Commons so on I'm forgetting
his name out but

650
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,520
is gonna need application and on this
stuff

651
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,910
the graffiti seeing the kinda middle
left people then used to put up on

652
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,020
buildings

653
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,850
and Second Life has to make it like
virtual graffiti for

654
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,130
wifi which is kind of interesting

655
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,130
arm before

656
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,800
more so are the spawn of I'll

657
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,160
the Harvard free culture archer so they
decide to do something to

658
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,009
and this is the heart from their ship
and on since its

659
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,700
kinda on you know it's just more art but

660
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,790
in a huge reception in our gallery um

661
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:39,540
I was really fun her some photos from
that night %uh they had live

662
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,200
performances from

663
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,450
people doing cell phone ringtone stuff
from on

664
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,339
just live remixing in general are

665
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:53,010
so here are this brings me to our last
project that this is your

666
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,619
which is a remix contest is anyone here
about this yes from earlier this

667
00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:00,460
cool years and 11 months of are reside
the sponsor

668
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,090
or people remixing DVD's in this is like
a

669
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,369
cause that was really near and dear to
my heart because

670
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:10,390
the whole reason I got involved in this
whole movement my whole interest us from

671
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,160
that one DCSS case

672
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,190
baffin 29-year whenever was and

673
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,650
I just I've still been thinking how
insane it is that people don't really

674
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,700
have

675
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,320
access to movies that they want to
create a

676
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,369
and remix so after love talking

677
00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:30,540
are actually I just presented this idea
the fickle trigger

678
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,320
and they're like this is okay this is
you know good idea

679
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,660
what are we remix worrying when we
encourage people to remix

680
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,980
movies into those kinda trailers that
your see online

681
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,950
Alec the book back to our future: wine
and Sponge Bob

682
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,359
mazlin or whatever was was the other one
a

683
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:54,160
the shining one was really good serious
in that arm so we wanna go

684
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,339
we want to kind of capitalize on that or
capitalize but

685
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,520
I'm jump on that bandwagon and I
encourage people to do remixes

686
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,660
movies and we didn't know what movies
were gonna do are

687
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:09,009
because we kind of got up got caught up
in talking about the legality of it

688
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:12,080
arm because a lot of those projects are
just things that people did

689
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,090
did themselves like it's just like I
found the tools

690
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,450
on the movie myself nobody told them to
do that

691
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,840
telling some you remix a DVD take apart
a DVD in

692
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,369
and essentially the cryptic is

693
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:29,420
is in itself illegal on the if you
instruct somebody

694
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:33,119
powder turn a DVD from its encrypted
form to

695
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,450
decrypted form if you give them specific
instruction we've been told them where

696
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,390
to get the specific instructions

697
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,160
trafficking DMCA violation arm

698
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,670
so as a club on campus we didn't quite
want to get

699
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,700
to angry we want to get the
administration to angry with us

700
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,160
so we can talk extensively and we're
also interested in this

701
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:57,060
about the legality of up hosting a
contest where we would be telling people

702
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,940
essentially break the law and whatever
older members are

703
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,450
told us that the one thing we had to do

704
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,660
was I'll to thought the lawyer so we go
back to our

705
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,810
provide a lawyer friend we're told that
we wanted to film remix contest and he

706
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,410
understands all implications

707
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,000
the DMCA and are we we have these long
meetings to decide that

708
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,660
we can give a link to a guy that gives a
link to a guide

709
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,390
I've had it secret to the if you're a
mean we can say here here guides on how

710
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:25,759
to

711
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,880
d crypt DVD's and then they themselves
have links to other pages that give you

712
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,470
the specific instructions

713
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:36,350
arm that can have degree of separation
from the offending

714
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:40,029
illegal code was was enough for our

715
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:43,890
lawyer to be happy but what he also
wants to do

716
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,250
was to create a legal waiver you get to
it arm

717
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,320
so we trade issues legal waiver that was
just like I mean if you look at this

718
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,650
page for culture and where you done or

719
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:59,260
such film remix there's this guy never
initial explanation about the project

720
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,430
and kinda how do I participate in
formats and and then there's a legal

721
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,220
waiver which

722
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,070
which stands we we've had this I'm hurt
people that sign in

723
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,180
and entered out on me submitted their
work

724
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,319
are and it's this kind have long

725
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,710
not so it's not as legally is as it
could be but um

726
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:21,150
basically indemnifies the club from any
team CA lawsuits

727
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:25,170
you happy if your work happens to get
picked out by the MPAA

728
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,720
and so on arm we did this

729
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,440
not so much to play by the letter of the
law but to

730
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:39,600
indicate how absurd the letter of the
law was love the project was just too

731
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,410
demonstrate that the DMCA makes media
creation for

732
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,580
like many artists using DVD's very
difficult

733
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,460
we want to show that you have to jump
through all these legal loopholes if you

734
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,660
want to just take a DVD

735
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,250
in excess or if you wanna take like a
photo the soup can and turn that into a

736
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,680
painting

737
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,850
its there's no dnt have poison their
right

738
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:02,560
are so we had people read through this
whole legal

739
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,580
disclaimer and kinda sign it and we have
a PDF to calm down lorenzo like

740
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,270
form only goal and that kind of thing
are and we have an FAQ

741
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,359
have explaining wiry did all this

742
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:17,520
on so it's got future ongoing mowing we
had a a

743
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,930
examples because I was assigning on

744
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:28,930
if this works

745
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:35,140
the line or

746
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:38,339
per not them

747
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,830
yet to bring up I'm I mean I look at my
side

748
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:46,160
yeah I'll and while we wait are

749
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,980
world we're fortunate to have to be able
to show the the

750
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,619
contest submissions a conference that we
were invited talk at

751
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:59,750

755
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:14,130
up you sorry about that

well way for a

765
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,850
so we're part of this fair use
conference a at NYU

766
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,839
they were able to show the videos were
but was really cause that they had an

767
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,440
explorer from the MPAA

768
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,210
sitting on the same panel like I
actually gotta sit next to this guy and

769
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,730
and then they had similar from music

776
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,570
you know kind these satires and parodies

777
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,040
silliness and um so

778
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,200

00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:19,380
I dot org licensed under Creative

807
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,170
192 kilobits and P-three's but they also
important Aug for you which I feel is a

808
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,150
lot smaller

809
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:28,410
incidentally been mp3 arm

810
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:32,890
but there's some great people talking
here are Lawrence Lessig get to talk to

811
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:33,430
our

812
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:37,879
are there's they're two great artist
writer nancy is my soul's

813
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:41,790
I'll talk about operator thing i guess
im just bored in this now but

814
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,380
um feel free to download it and send it
around

815
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,480
um I guess you know now

816
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,510
open up to questions every interest in
like the student movement

817
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:55,370
a router next projects are I'll and tell
you next year

818
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,540
and where you are going to be a grad
student ass and to start agitating about

819
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:03,390
are how much and where you case for
journals arm

820
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,629
if you've ever worked in a library or no
people working libraries all know how

821
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:07,930
much

822
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,310
academic journals cost in car a single
journal that comes out maybe two times

823
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:12,560
are

824
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,850
even quarterly causative thirty thousand
dollars a year

825
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,660
are I think thats after physics be I've
heard quoted

826
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,859
are right now there are alternatives but
they need to make more

827
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:27,190
and there needs to be education from the
university level

828
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,230
so that those people doing research at
universities

829
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,670
no to publish their stuff under open
access rather than

830
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,800
with the publishing machine that's when
my big projects and where to start

831
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,340
to fighting with and why you to have
been this close

832
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,220
how much they're paying for their
journals make that available to the

833
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,270
students so they know how much their
tuition goes to paying for copyright on

834
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,750
I'm journals that could be free
scientist hey these journals themselves

835
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,940
to publish their own work

836
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,760
and i get charged to get access to it so

837
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,490
arm I want the students to know about
that I want in I want them to know that

838
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:00,840
you know

839
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,940
X percent is going to have silly

840
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,740
copyright fees arm that's one thing I
think we're probably do another

841
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:11,230
during protest here there on by all
means sign up in your

842
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,360
know about it before everyone else does
arm

843
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,120
I think a are always the most of the
works

844
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,940
one thing works in doing is are setting
up a freedom toaster

845
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,610
them you know that is on this moral
limits project but it's interesting

846
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,020
because its earning corporator Commons
license music and art

847
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:34,790
offering toasters a project set up by
I'll the Shuttleworth foundation

848
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,220
Mark Shuttleworth is a guy that runs
conical that runs been to

849
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:43,530
um so they designed a kiosk

850
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,000
are that would burn 1x project
gutenberg: all these kind of

851
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,150
freely copier popiel media things on the
TV is for you

852
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,390
they made thirty these kiosks and
distribute them around South Africa

853
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,600
which is pretty cool and nature and I
found that over your people

854
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,450
these this kiosk became incredibly
interests like incredibly important in

855
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:04,390
these communities

856
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,730
up shots would set up next next to them
and just sell

857
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:11,710
blank media for people to use on these
kiosks are created this on

858
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,740
kinda like small local economy but II
just I was just at the

859
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,360
I common summit in brazil I got to meet
a bunch of them so

860
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:23,320
I'm gonna work on trying to build one of
those emperor and what you do or

861
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,420
arm and see what happens to kind of get
1x farther into the

862
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,220
community and now they're gonna start
supporting are

863
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:35,150
Creative Commons content stuff from CC
next yr .org which is the kind of

864
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:38,940
a iron ore YouTube Creative Commons

865
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,570
music us to forever hopefully will be on
their rivers a

866
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,880
um a YouTube alternative that

867
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,270
incorporates occurred Commons licenses
but also allows you to charge

868
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:52,120
advertising fees before and after your

869
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,000
um video so those are things we have in
the future so

870
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,340
coming over for more questions because
if

871
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:06,290
yes

872
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:09,570
all academic journal thing is really a
good thing

873
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:14,970
to talk about yeah I'm an astrophysicist
know exactly what to talk

874
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:19,520
but you know most most of us who are
past the 10-year heard

875
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,250
who RM academic institutions or national
laboratories

876
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,660
most of us a publishing on xxx-large
other go rich

877
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:32,490
which is free right and that's physics I
mean there's there's a whole biology 0

878
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:35,890
that yes I I think I think there is a
movement rare

879
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:40,830
people just creating the sort of
databases and people submit papers your

880
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:44,960
and its it's interesting its its often
more useful than this sort of

881
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,780
traditional journals because

882
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:52,050
you get a lot more feedback on your work
your people email you and say hey I read

883
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:53,060
that paper

884
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,610
that was posted on the site for you
explain what you meant by this area I

885
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,950
thought that was really good idea I
thought that sucks that's

886
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:02,310
totally wrong you know so

887
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:06,320
gone now II I keep to go on yeah I did
get a hundred

888
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,480
I mean more people we have from kind of
tenured academic year

889
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,670
agreeing with us the better sorry up

890
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,330
