1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,159
thank you very much a actually

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:07,670
I think I'm the only speaker today and a
colony sitting somewhere there and

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,660
having a good time listen to me once
again okay

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:16,020
a my your name is Johannes scans for
dinner about forget about that

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,040
a I'm part else macomb

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,580
collected from Vienna Austria long way

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,780
over the Atlantic ants basically Verma

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,790
small tour through a North America

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:35,739
and maybe that's picture sese La Salsa

10
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,419
North America we took it two days ago in
philadelphia We the People

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,589
under construction an ounce a

12
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:45,879
monochrome basically

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,039
a thought about a nice title for today's
talk or talk colo on whatever you call

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:51,379
it

15
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:56,329
and first thought maybe call its no
power for theory and/or practice

16
00:00:56,329 --> 00:00:59,409
than we thought no that's not a good
title maybe should call it there's

17
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,530
something rotten in the state of
Argentina

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,670
a maybe there's a lot of rotten in the
state of Argentina three

19
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,930
a talk about new lira politics nowadays
but

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:12,950
not a good title for today so maybe I
never promised euros

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,979
reports maybe that's a good title

22
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,780
no maybe entropy in the UK birds

23
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,880
we under we on the wrongs run like

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,908
country okay maybe

25
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,229
that's cool it's new German DAX way for
us we're gonna find you

26
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,000
arm an determined or previous here

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,520
well I thought this so

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,600
or maybe cheeses let's see more than
you'll know

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,909
who may be a bit odd to

30
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,659
but actually up orkut or knocked out so
sitting back there

31
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,049
is constantly waiting for the Second
Coming so maybe if he sees cheese is a

32
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:51,390
good

33
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,159
actually sells out loud okay so but
suddenly thought maybe the best title

34
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:56,740
would be

35
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,820
we are great together the liberal
society and its enemies and i think

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,380
thats

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,490
may be good statement about the United
States of

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,710
America okie for the fall what do we do

39
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,269
we are a collective author scientists
artists

40
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:13,800
people dealing with technology whatever
am

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,580
a monochrome is our name and we thought
we on data

42
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,209
hackers convention he we thought maybe
we present ourselves with a nice

43
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,209
like cyber Ark picture and without

44
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,840
maybe about this one I think it gets the
feeling a little bit better

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,180
what we are doing and its I'd like to
tell you

46
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,680
a couple of anecdotes so as long as a
fight I'm halftime

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,269
about to approach it with you lost the
couple for years

48
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,560
and I'd like to start with the project

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,640
a a with the title York part 01

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,530
because up I mean basically I think we
invited to you

51
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,459
to hope because it with other approach X
in the sector of

52
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,129
that's called it culture jamming or I
would say I would call it context tech

53
00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:00,409
okay so a a couple of years ago the year
2001

54
00:03:00,409 --> 00:03:03,709
we have been invites its by crew rates
for

55
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:07,659
from slovenia to participate in a really
really big

56
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:12,280
arts events in a Sao Paulo it was called
the biennial of Sao Paulo

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,080
and by in a sample the for for you don't
know anything about like

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,159
a kite superstructures the Vienna in Sao
Paulo

59
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,290
is like the third biggest art events
liver

60
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,450
stirs the documents are in custom orders
to Venice Biennial in Venice and then

61
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:25,930
there's the

62
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,150
by an unsound although in the southern
hemisphere and

63
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,150
basically up we were invited as
monochrome as a group

64
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,879
if River have a really highly surprised
about that to represent

65
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,040
the Republic Austria at this peak

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:46,078
RT went and then we thought about it I
mean representing Austria

67
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,349
actually we didn't want to do that at
all up

68
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,939
basically because that was a peak
political shift

69
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,969
in the year two thousand in Austria so
the Conservative Party

70
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:01,260
teamed up the coalition with the
far-right Freedom Party

71
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,849
so it was a really really messy
extremely conservative

72
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,760
government and its the working nowadays
and so with that we don't want three

73
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,379
percent this country with

74
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,709
this like let's call it's a

75
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,238
governments a somewhere in the world but

76
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:20,680
we had the idea to mom we could do
something about that

77
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,680
and then with I the year not going there
ourselves

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,080
but sending somebody else there so we
could actually just have been chosen to

79
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,940
to do the task so we said okay we wanted
people to mingles there

80
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,460
and the people Tomas a common was 57
years

81
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,940
by that they he was like Bay astronaut
thagard I

82
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,289
is to be a lot of works even work
together with survival research lab said

83
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:46,210
he wrote the first room inside the
park's

84
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,780
short story in and a lot of stuff
viennese actions meant

85
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,430
pre pretty famous guy and many people
were really like

86
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,090
Yap difficult woman goes to buy Yahoo
for foster this

87
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,940
excellent many newspapers wrote about it
and stuff like that

88
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,870
a but basically difficult woman doesn't
exist

89
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,080
so we made him up he's in arts avatar

90
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,590
that's cool okay a so most of the time

91
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:15,729
a he wrote his biography and its crew
about the

92
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:21,139
500 pages of biography in about all the
things give paul Solman tits

93
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,160
that's really interesting because the
quotes cram all

94
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,080
the information about the last forty
years of pop culture in the last forty

95
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,719
years of art history and

96
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,110
societal history we could cram all these
together

97
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,960
dislike condensed up worsen and called
it the appall 20 min and what the

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,039
Apostle mandates

99
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,130
actually there's could the freezing our
and yes the Phuket

100
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,729
give it give it to the people a at:

101
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,199
I so it's a really really state a

102
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,449
book and you actually nobody realized
that the people to move didn't didn't

103
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:55,449
exist nobody

104
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:58,960
researched about it so we went to the
body and other sample them

105
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,568
and interesting part and that's
everywhere in the world is it's likely

106
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:03,400
be companies

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,460
is it in art structures wherever there's
a clock clear hierarchy

108
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,568
so it's all about hierarchies even if
the iraqis relief let's but

109
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:14,729
if letter ricki still is a high-risk and

110
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,409
a so we came there and that's the
problem was

111
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,449
for ourselves so that was good that we
verne artists there

112
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,180
we chose for technical support team
difficult so much

113
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,539
so we nails and with the then we hang up
his stupid

114
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:33,750
painting sells stuff a based

115
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,750
that same actually up am

116
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,120
a that's a wonderful love arts work if
it's called material studied with

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,139
scanned photo of herself in a beer mood
and focus of crystallization filter

118
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,819
up okay so we wear their

119
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,340
we've got a technical support team every
like the part of the higher if you can

120
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:53,960
imagine

121
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,330
there's like the administration Fort
there's the top curator's

122
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,370
there's a curator at the top artists
artists

123
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,610
more artists more artists a technical
support team

124
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,150
and even below the technical support
teams are the arts kites

125
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,500
so the people showing people around them
explaining them relacion

126
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,960
really important to us even like modern
art and contemporary art

127
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,180
so but that's really the bottom line of
the hierarchy so we were sitting there

128
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,819
and

129
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,120
nobody talked to a state of calling for
a ski pole to a mechanic

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,599
speak at the month forgetful Palmer
arguable two-month event just said to

131
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
them you know he's sitting in his hotel
room and watching porn channel so with

132
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,220
them

133
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,690
I'm envious of the technical support
team you know up

134
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,969
but we had the interesting idea because
they wanted to flip the hierarchies a

135
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:36,889
little bit

136
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,020
a we had died year to a

137
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,219
to tell the people and other technical
support teams

138
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,259
and the people from the heart guides to
basically tell the whole story

139
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,900
so we didn't tell them you are not
allowed to talk about the fate and the

140
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,280
talk about the project so

141
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,479
its up to you it's your free willy can
tell

142
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,419
whomever you like whatever you like and
that was really interesting because

143
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:03,060
all over this like the I event the
bubbles

144
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,919
of rumors start Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

145
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:10,299
your problem you see what's what's the
point I'll

146
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,960
aka love its it wasn't real real big
mess

147
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,000
at an interesting anecdotes was that we
wanted to get or

148
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,150
art catalogs with the picture of people
to mine and stuff like that so we went

149
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,159
to the the Clark to get the that the cat
looks at the clock set actually are you

150
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,770
people to minus have no I'm not the Paul
Solman

151
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,889
give alt woman is a fake and is it what

152
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,930
is a fake fake artist here who'll

153
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,410
you don't get any catholics so we didn't
get any catholics

154
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,370
okay fine a but a

155
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,780
the the room most current the bubble the
public purse that

156
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,350
and it's a there was an interesting
thing because basically we're left with

157
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,240
three left is

158
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,770
Fleetwood little group actually art
group a so

159
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,110
a we think a lot about solidarity house
a how is

160
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,490
how can there be a new form of
solidarity in the

161
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,710
global societal and capitalist system
that is

162
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,180
totally against solidarity a so

163
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,070
with think a lot about stuff like that
and there was an interesting

164
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:14,910
incident at this biennial that up next
to our art

165
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:18,530
cue you know like to the commodity value
of an artist

166
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,740
there's a small bite you a small liked
you and a small

167
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,410
liked you small to Pinterest people
sitting there and their work

168
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,520
you like likes coca-cola cans

169
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,170
now and its a there was some next to a
white cube was a

170
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,660
the White Cube of the official
representative of Thai Baht

171
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,689
10 teach on basically is from New York
where he is now

172
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,500
living in New York and gym teacher on
had a strange problem just

173
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,490
two or three days before the opening of
the events the big event

174
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,050
somebody had removed for his country's
name tax so that were like

175
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,350
adhesive letters on the outside %uh each
what you

176
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,030
and a on the Austin right through the
most difficult Oman

177
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,079
Austria and is what because chance to
John

178
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,580
type and the taiwan was removed and
replaced by

179
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:11,810
a Taipei Museum of Fine Arts so them you
seem that because that's in there

180
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,060
a so he was really upset about that
because he did the really critical

181
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,780
piece of art little piece of art about
mental asylums

182
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,160
the Tyvon they are like really strange

183
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,689
inhuman and stuff like that a so he
really wanted to

184
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,150
re percent taiwan and precise time on by
that way

185
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,250
so he was upset that he talked to people
in the government

186
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,440
attended the demonstration and nobody
could tell them anything

187
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,340
and so we wrote an open letter and he
was really pissed and actually wanted to

188
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:41,660
leave

189
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,719
the biennial and then found out about
them

190
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,660
like the scent of an open letter to all
the other artists and we saw it and

191
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,949
that we went to him and asked what
happens and we deal with research and

192
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,080
then we found out

193
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,270
that's a China made a lot of troubles

194
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,360
because China doesn't accept Ivonne as a
single country

195
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,500
one-china policy so China basically said
okay

196
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,110
we are leaving or China or Taiwan is
leaving and that the administration say

197
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,660
p

198
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,579
we don't want to China for time and
leave so we just remove

199
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,340
I want them still can stay if without
the

200
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,500
name tech actually so

201
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,480
a we thought okay there's like this peak
diplomatic

202
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,870
battle behinds behind-the-scenes between
like China and Taiwan and administration

203
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:31,030
and so we had ID year to a somehow

204
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,699
supports a change the channel or two a
former Solidarity Campaign

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,200
am a we basically that was a

206
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,100
two-month exhibition so people truman
Austria

207
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,750
removed we removed the the TV from
Austria

208
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,630
and donates its to time and them

209
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,270
we us via far wonderful

210
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:57,290
and you see a I

211
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,329
arrivals from predatory go

212
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,610
and Canada and I said Aycock NAS have 3
A's

213
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,460
you can I they can give many tomorrow up

214
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,120
I and we got the a and finally managed
to make like

215
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,960
Tyvon on the outside of the queue at the
W is a little bit

216
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,640
was little problematic couldn't get the
W but we're alike really liked

217
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,180
your practiced so it creates like the

218
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,660
0 and turn W sometimes

219
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,110
so a jettisoned asleep highly like a

220
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,730
like he was really like he really liked
it so he stayed at the biennial

221
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,990
and many many a type in the Sun even
american newspapers came in

222
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,350
the pictures and interview to attend to
John

223
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,700
and a just the like I think three or
four days later

224
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,050
there was a a couple of headlines in
Taiwanese and Chinese newspapers

225
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,550
and it was a really great up headline in
the Taipei Times

226
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,920
it was Austrian artist York Paul
two-month saves time

227
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,600
its so i think thats as radical as
possible as you can get

228
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,190
so and non existing artist saves
non-existent country

229
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,670
a yep their mother tho anecdotes about
the life and times of

230
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,760
your poll two morrow like arts pro-poor
art

231
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,790
history proves let's call it ants but

232
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,130
kills him last year 2005 I want to
believe

233
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,510
his burden a small small village Tyrel

234
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:30,710
in Austria and we organized all the
visit and like in the park and urs

235
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,270
tombstone is actually the only tombstone
in the world with a engraved your

236
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,199
element

237
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,150
a wanna from the 80s last two months

238
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,790
and a it was really find the

239
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,160
yeah actually died a on the 21st of July

240
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,219
in new moon landing and stuff and a

241
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,910
a but we did it together with a couple
of

242
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,760
interest in Fox in the small village and
like

243
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,970
a couple of months later the people who
help us organize the

244
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,560
the burial the funeral I

245
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,230
they called us and the told us on the
phone that the tombstone had to be

246
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,880
removed

247
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,670
and house them but it was all like set
it with me here and so why is the

248
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,430
tombstone

249
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,540
gone now and they said basically like

250
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,370
next to this part for the tombstone is
there is like

251
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:24,090
there's a hospital for for for people
with nervous

252
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,740
illnesses and like mental illnesses so
and

253
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,420
many many of those patience from this
hospital

254
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,860
went to people to mine prayed for him
laid down flowers

255
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,610
you can see them there a and for highly
upset

256
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,680
about the that you called someone there
so

257
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,180
the head of the hospital sets the Nexus
think that artist has to be removed

258
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,660
so he was removed and now finally

259
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,230
truth talked to Mom sexists a somehow

260
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:58,560
so I don't know what a tombstone always
I think it laying around somewhere in

261
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:58,980
this

262
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,110

instruments cow max crash marked okay

360
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,800
quest Mike known a question mark

361
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,390
a there are 20 trillion

362
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,590
dollars on the planet's in cash

363
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,800
so there's no golden banks no like no

364
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,990
money on bank accounts just the cash $20
trillion dollars

365
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,630
how often how many to rations does it
take to exchange 20 trillion dollars to

366
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,870
euros to dollars to use to the others to
use

367
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,470
until they're gone of so

368
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:56,850
a and I would say a the person in the
room who gets the closest

369
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:02,950
its wince give Paul Thomas biography
trite

370
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,090
50 who yeah

371
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:14,090
500,000 who I mean if you're interested
themselves

372
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,500
when you're going to get the most really
don't know more

373
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,750
five in 2050 sixty million

374
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,050
Wow forty-nine

375
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:31,210
and infinite number it's getting

376
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:38,210
okay more 10

377
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,960
while come on yeah I comment just
shouted out

378
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,960
whatever through thousands

379
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,010
up

380
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,220
so you want to like how many how many
like percents

381
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:01,320
for like present that would be the south
it's already there I think its 3-point

382
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,439
63

383
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,620
I will we get actually the same changes
to the bank and in Austria so that's

384
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,760
I think yeah to Mongkok

385
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,650
where

386
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:20,080
golf okay but I think I think I'll stop
now

387
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,540
and I tell you I tell if the answer its
849 times

388
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,809
and 8c 18 cents will remain

389
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:31,530
actually a I think it should be like 19
cents

390
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:35,549
we did they to rations meant XO and I
could Microsoft Excel

391
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:39,990
terrible and stares one sent me see you
know like there's one center was going

392
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,669
to be gates

393
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:46,160
so up its 802 4908 who who was the
closest

394
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,620
I think 500 was a was clear with another
with

395
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,790
know that was the most 50

396
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,970
there was 50 and 500 who would who who
who said 500

397
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,960
up

398
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,980
I from houses site it's for tonight so

399
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,980

400
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,280
he or she is if I our

401
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,750
I would see this is a free country
whoever said

402
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,360
50 gets the fifth output is here

403
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,559
I would say okay a hold ons

404
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,649
cause the time halftime wonderful

405
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,679
okay that I would say yeah is mankind's
to blame

406
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,100
of course I would say a don't go to
sleep

407
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,309
I'm an artist I can do whatever I like

408
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:46,220
but I don't get any funding for its

409
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,730
so a okie dokie a

410
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,809
I would say a there is a topic that
might interest you

411
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,750
a little bit more than exchanges I don't
know a its let's call it

412
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:02,530
retro gaming because we started to
protect the couple of years ago

413
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:05,530
and it's called soviets offered to the
store we wrote

414
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:08,629
a and it went to gain and a

415
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,480
this a this adventure oil I think we
published its like with

416
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,510
its of course Creative Commons license
you can

417
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,840
you know put its a on the Internet

418
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,010
a in December now in September 2005

419
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,690
we worked about 1/2 years in its and
basically it's a computer game

420
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,900
that's a based on the project did a
couple of years

421
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,950
Ford because we're because you're from
Europe and we are highly interested

422
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,690
in like the pasta World Books who a

423
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,919
history of your own what happens

424
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,770
basically like you come from like the
postmodern

425
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:48,840
week of a philosophy with college so

426
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,850
we basically don't believe in history
there is no history don't like

427
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:56,179
fragmented forms of history so how could
it be something like that history

428
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,440
of Europe for history of Austria history
whatever

429
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,640
okay a so with that we want to play with
the

430
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,120
history of Europe and implant

431
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,620
a a small tiny little country called
soviet

432
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:13,620
into the store into the country of
Austria

433
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:18,350
it's only like 15 square a square miles
the it's really small and Lexie

434
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,370
everything lexus lexus people in not
letting whatever

435
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,320
but it still exists it is a shame and
I'll support of course

436
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,899
and it survived up to a decline of the
soviet union is the last remaining

437
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,419
soviets country

438
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:35,740
on the planet and a in 2001 ten years
after the

439
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,090
fall of the Soviet Union organized with
the bus to pick up the bus

440
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,309
we organized vacation soviets consist of

441
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,080
so many people could go to soviet the
superstores and

442
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,280
up they're basically it's actually was a
pretty

443
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,250
funny idea to do it but we belts with

444
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,980
a topics like historian Rafi what can we
do what can we tell about history

445
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,960
a on the first few it just looks like a
mock up of the soviet union

446
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,370
but basically actually it's more
remarkable from the liberal society

447
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,690
now with the sand most of the
information be cramped into

448
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:15,770
into the the computer game is basically
more about an hour the stand about

449
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:20,900
some some some collapse the form of
communism that actually never was a

450
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,540
communism

451
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,830
I okay so I mean if you're interested I
can show you a couple of

452
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,090
physical play a little bit for you or
are you more interested in just

453
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,630
downloading it so to ensure mister okay

454
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,679
I saw a little bit about it and now has
two

455
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:43,679
admits it's a sock in Windows machines a
its is her laptop

456
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,700
at least it's real it's not mine no no
no

457
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,309
I'm I'm so if threats it's a Siemens
machine with Windows on it

458
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:56,860
help desk and it gets so

459
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,240
all we

460
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,330
we of course there's limits were

461
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,439
of course the pic let's start

export

493
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,749
the world and paste thought we should do
some kinda like your

494
00:30:14,749 --> 00:30:19,039
a retro gaming forum so it's of course
it's an adventure game

495
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,330
so only like 1 percent before for the
games nowadays

496
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,658
produced are 2013 so they're going to be
in this kind of really like

497
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:28,720
debts that form of computer games
thought

498
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,450
it's interesting to to take us like that
four months of states communism intake

499
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,519
this nearly there for months of of

500
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,759
a for $23 million combined together so a

501
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,059
various party secretary Kamal kar and up
can

502
00:30:43,059 --> 00:30:46,539
look around for example you can have a
look or

503
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:50,100
at the trash sure game

504
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,220
those or you can overlook

505
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,960
at one step piece of cloth moms

506
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,289

507
00:31:00,289 --> 00:31:04,309
midway in the movies shoe spawn of

508
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:07,749
wats good you before you post your
mature

509
00:31:07,749 --> 00:31:12,460
new story so of course you can take over
stuff so I'll take the

510
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:17,179
he's a few trip

511
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:22,399
asked okay and now I love can look an
inventory of course

512
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,769
there see the piece of white cloth and
the pass for now

513
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:32,769
let's have a look I will look like ok
that's odd

514
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:38,370
okie but basically I mean there's lots
of stress

515
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,380
and yeah come from to 15 there's lots of
trash so what we of course

516
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,760
can pick up all the trash by the
candidates for yourself

517
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,760
so let's go to the next place of what's
that's boy

518
00:31:53,650 --> 00:32:00,650
there's slayer written on the wall

519
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,919
and so with the simple stuff and there's
no might start so it gets really likes

520
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:14,920
missiles

521
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:22,930
should so that's ok

522
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,780
I would say it's best to contact the
supreme soviet's

523
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,870
of across and I would see what can I
call upon

524
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:38,870
I'll ask him what is a slayer small iraq

525
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:49,770
yeah

526
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:58,600
whatever

527
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,250
hang out and I think I'll presently the
message to the people

528
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:10,250
from ok maybe this one

529
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,309
Ste

530
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:20,889
so

531
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,580
okie let's hang up let's go back I would
simply

532
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:29,820
by walk seems to know

533
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:34,649
too late to date they have like a
contacting negative land because you can

534
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,210
directly to us that that the song that's
playing at the Copa

535
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,070
negative land there's Christianity
stupid in its wonderful

536
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,080
there's the nuclear compost area

537
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,690
so that's the 8 bits agrarian memory
drive

538
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,780
but the first have to start since a it
takes a long time to find the stuff to

539
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,960
stock if it's very never drive are

540
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,970
Obama strange trash let's take the
strain stress

541
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,929
all

542
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:09,369
each

543
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:13,260
so who

544
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,720
what's that see see

545
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,260
ships was a disco

546
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,280
whatever high and there's a label as
above the law

547
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:33,300
of and now we get these this Google

548
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,330
on the UC shop just

549
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,540
so I would say

550
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:45,790
maybe we'll go to one more police here
because that's interesting for them then

551
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,089
no stop and go to the next project
because you see

552
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:53,168
shoes

553
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:56,949
stop use they killed all the tickets

554
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:00,540
disc use

555
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,529
used

556
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,040
source

557
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,110
also prepared

558
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,720
to sleep which its

559
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:23,720
it's it's it's it's sorry 650

560
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,440
a cute little chicken I think I'll kill
its I think

561
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,809
the I'll go somewhere

562
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:41,210
I think there's some kind of the
monumental words but skip it

563
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,280
and go to the outskirts those it's the
minor errors

564
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,740
means modes puts closed

565
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:56,740
see much most if whatever

566
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:01,460
its

567
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,180
use work

568
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,480
school mobile mob dance locals

569
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,520
yitzhak word

570
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,520
as st. used precludes

571
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,519
yaa so

572
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,690
I would say you for a long time to play
it's a model from the 30s less

573
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,890
s you set like zebra this

574
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,990
day so you can download it for South I
can tell you

575
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:38,269
the place were consigned it afterwards
how many

576
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:41,650
how many more minutes 50

577
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,660
that's fine okay that I would say

578
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,999
IQ a to a project that's called ours

579
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:51,160
electronic of a

580
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,999
we are from Austria you know everybody's
talking about ours electronica

581
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:59,230
and we thought actually it's a an
invitation to you to help us with that

582
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:02,329
because a a we think

583
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:05,589
that there's 11 really like really
important

584
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:09,640
up part of technological like progress
that was never like

585
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,150
really focused on in them art exhibition
corner

586
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,299
scientific conference or Computer
Conference

587
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:23,009
and that is like a a pornography and
technological innovation so

588
00:37:23,009 --> 00:37:27,640
pornography is one of the most driving
forces of technological innovation

589
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,150
and we want to actually do a conference
about that so if you're interested it's

590
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,999
it's not until

591
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:36,549
really want to do with some time next
year maybe two years it takes a lot of

592
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:37,220
research

593
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:40,630
through the stuff basically I mean

594
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,910
a a their

595
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,970
vent like between 1840 and 19 97

596
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,089
1997 it's just $19.97 its it it's like

597
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:54,749
doubled after that but just between
nineteen 8040

598
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:58,359
and 1997 800 a sex toy items

599
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,819
were patented at the American patrons
are office

600
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:05,900
and a there is a for example the first

601
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,210
Polaroid camera for school swinger and
it was called swinger for certain

602
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:10,749
reasons

603
00:38:10,749 --> 00:38:14,190
K a their a you my no

604
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:17,670
you might know the story about that the
HST

605
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,359
because like the Wii U two thousand tape
and the Betamax tape

606
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,730
both were like superior Intertechnology
they had really clear

607
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,509
a like pic a was really good but we it s

608
00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:33,650
made it on the market because because of
the license fees

609
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,549
because v8 a VHS VHS consortium didn't
ask for any license fees

610
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:41,980
up for a VHS tapes saw the porn markets

611
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,180
sets on we get ass and that's why VHS
became like

612
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,489
for the big it take for much of the
1980s and 1990s

613
00:38:49,489 --> 00:38:53,160
not not be two thousand and not Peter
Max but beavers like

614
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,609
better soda and other for interesting
stories about technology

615
00:38:57,609 --> 00:39:00,730
am a pornography I mean I think

616
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:04,319
18 ninety there was one person London

617
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:07,609
up his sup a house was raided and he had

618
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:11,589
300,000 pornographic pictures in his
house

619
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:15,390
in a time 1890 or something like that so
up

620
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,788
the first there was like a big
underground market of pornography

621
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:21,980
photographs in the late 19th century

622
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,440
and would like to focus on that and
especially a man I'm sitting here

623
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,549
a monk fellow nerds your mother for
recognized the last 10 years like

624
00:39:30,549 --> 00:39:33,859
most stuff like ChexSystems and a

625
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:37,130
really really like interesting
technological advances

626
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:40,720
in Internet technology worked referred
by a

627
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,880
pornography companies and stuff like
that so basically

628
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,650
Ars Electronica not a bad joke but if he
has an interesting stories or if you

629
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,089
want to talk with our conference or
whatever activity on the way to do it

630
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,279
because we don't get any funding for in
Austria

631
00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:56,839
so with I don't know where it may be
announced that

632
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:00,558
points on San Francisco made my pic with
interesting idea

633
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:04,999
so I see morning ten minutes okay so if
you're interested please

634
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:08,029
up stay here contact the sender email
rear

635
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:12,980
a highly interested in doing a this this
conference and exhibition

636
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,009
okie dokie just 10 more minutes maybe
two more

637
00:40:17,009 --> 00:40:21,650
up projects this call this %uh this
proteins called benchmark a

638
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:24,789
and to rent marker a

639
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,930
is a project was started in 2003

640
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,169
because we've we thought there is a like
a

641
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,239
logos brand logos corporate logos alike

642
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,069
one-way communication you have to
recognize them if to

643
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:42,049
to see them you have to decipher them
but don't have to reproduce them

644
00:40:42,049 --> 00:40:45,759
so we ask people in Austria to draw law

645
00:40:45,759 --> 00:40:49,890
logos corporate logos from memory so

646
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:53,339
if somebody would go to you and ask you
i mean it's its even know you because

647
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:53,980
you see it

648
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,039
but if something goes up to assess up
police

649
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,319
draw me the Apple logo hmm

650
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,279
from your minds it's not quite as easy
but basically

651
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:07,700
we don't want to make fun about those
people because most of them didn't

652
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,239
really

653
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:12,470
with group a good job from enjoying the
locals

654
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,769
but its actually it's about like a
short-circuiting

655
00:41:16,769 --> 00:41:20,299
like your reception let's call it like
that and I'd like to show you a couple

656
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:20,900
of

657
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,579
a of the tries the people that it's

658
00:41:25,579 --> 00:41:30,440
its starting its starting its Firefox

659
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,509
come on you for or

660
00:41:33,509 --> 00:41:37,400
no the Firefox collapse

661
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,569
law yes okay a in

662
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:43,609
grants think it's called share of mines

663
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:46,609
if you don't really recognize a friends
a so

664
00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:50,319
what local would you like to see made a
couple of like couple European locust

665
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:50,880
there

666
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,799
because they are highly popular in in
Europe so but most of the others

667
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:57,920
you should actually no what you don't
write adidas

668
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,920
okay stride %uh

669
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,500
could good

670
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,410
now that

671
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,308
its to leave maybe it's it's the I don't
know it is so

672
00:42:19,309 --> 00:42:22,400
no wrong direction

673
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,920
but I mean Apple is really interesting
as many people have

674
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,470
Apple computers that's so slow

675
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,670
michaud's

676
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,849
I yes ok

677
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,269
this is the part is the mixup left and
right and I talk to the

678
00:42:40,269 --> 00:42:43,730
to a biologist who is interested in
evolutionary studies of the eye

679
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,910
and it's all those a if peaked at
approaches you in the Savannah

680
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,399
it doesn't matter if it comes from left
to right to just run okay

681
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,730
so up the the structure of the I

682
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,500
isn't really into like recognizing or
like less the rights you can

683
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,869
really flip horizontal and it doesn't
matter so that's the reason why many

684
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:04,710
people

685
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,599
a like slip up left and right in their
memories a

686
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,210
butts you can see me know

687
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:15,990
I'll I at the

688
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,400
vanya the whole nerd arm

689
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,670
think just think the friend is good too

690
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,000
at pope a UN

691
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,819
the and that's good and this guy
actually ask him afterwards

692
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:35,220
so what did you think by the stripes and
vibe I dislike

693
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,839
cutting in the middle of the stripes and
he says oh no I may I like I confused

694
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:39,980
like Apple and IBM

695
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,759
of month

696
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:47,809
maybe maybe I should I mean so y'all to

697
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:54,019
is really I mean yeah up

698
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:58,549
that that looks like failing to timely I
means a

699
00:43:58,549 --> 00:44:04,560
and there's a lot of you see I mean
whatever status like a mushroom

700
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:08,250
and of course the he and

701
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,330
maybe make a call that last one year the

702
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:16,279
enjoys their a directly getting it quite
well

703
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,450
a some write it with a K me I'll

704
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:24,020
and and this one's good actually it was
a guy asking

705
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,270
so you you you've drawn like the Pepsi
logo so

706
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:31,300
was just like some kind of like a
political statement or something like

707
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:32,790
that and he said

708
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,080
no I thought that's coca-cola and I said
no it's not because I expect see

709
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,740
you know rivals Mia and its sooo

710
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,420
I don't know the most important local
governments

711
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,650
I told him no don't

712
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,710
I mean it's not the most important logo
in the world

713
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,970
don't forget the cross but the up

714
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,200
a but it's a I K a

715
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,570
but I mean means attends can

716
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:08,450
this one is really like this dynamic

717
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,430
I'm and I the people started to like
creative work that started rolling means

718
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:12,919
the first

719
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,540
and it may be some of the sperms here
Assia look at that

720
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:22,330
I mean walls whatever

721
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,810
and once again lesson right flips a lot
of left and right for

722
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,330
wright-phillips okay that's a red marker
you can have a look at our home page

723
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:33,590
and now it's time

724
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:37,170
to infect you we start its

725
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,030
the 14th of July the 14th of July

726
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,520
is the birthdate the founding day after
nation of zambia

727
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:48,300
and you don't know what's the nation of
zambia

728
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,910
I can tell you because I have some
application forms hits

729
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:56,040
the nation of zombie up

730
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,259
you can become a member of the nation of
Zambia

731
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:02,680
who gets paper and

732
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,359
a if you agree and you want to become a
member of Zambia

733
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:11,350
first of all they have to think are you
citizens of the United States or

734
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:15,339
the constitutional monarchy of Canada
okay so if you're a canadian

735
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,600
are you a citizen you can become became
become

736
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:23,580
member of the nation of zambia is really
good alien stuff like that doesn't work

737
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,009
okay you have to be citizen so you get

738
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:31,230
a copy from me for example and you agree
you want to be a zombie

739
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,340
and the nation of Zambia an official
representative of a nation of zambia

740
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:38,480
so to go to our home page you answer

741
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,980
is on the Colts and then you have a map
application and you can't map

742
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,890
the place there you have been infected
so we have like

743
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,190
an epidemic spreading map of the United
States and Canada and we can't overlook

744
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,800
Verka some biz pop-up and their actually
quite

745
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,290
some sums popped up the last days in San
Francisco and Los Angeles

746
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,500

747
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,570
eastern coast more like there are lots
of some biz in Toronto

748
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:09,760
there's even one if ACA written a

749
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,330
so if you want to become a member of the
Nation of Islam be a

750
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,890
and you want to leave the United States
of America or you can

751
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,240
just become a sleeper if you like so you
don't have to infect people just

752
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,160
