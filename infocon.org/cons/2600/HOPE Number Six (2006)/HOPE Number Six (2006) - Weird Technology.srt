1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,350
now before start I wanna be sure all the
feds are seated comfortably

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,970
now okay good not mean here

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,620
well this is a little probably

4
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,029
you can see this it's just a little toy
I've got noisy neighbours

5
00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:20,750
you know what it's like and this was our
home kit

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,300
I had gone for a place in new hampshire
what it is

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,439
admits a shock wave in 130 decibels yes
it does work

8
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,730
a few times as they can attest to
analyze at myself for the once

9
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,260
I'm not on purpose alcohol was involved
but

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,620
it works so

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,190
some the basics on it Knoxy it's a very
simple

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,050
unit to build so should even be
mentioning that does god only knows

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,270
what's gonna happen now

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,489
but I'm it omits and

15
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,050
there's an audible tone range between
five and 20 kilohertz

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,879
and basic services simple hardware

17
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,490
is you can see the housing it says PVC
pipe no

18
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:10,880
gotten anywhere and we works is that you
have

19
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,740
others a timer that's connected as in a
stable freerunning

20
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,048
multivibrator take mines back

21
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,020
here with externally controlled
frequencies

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,110
so that's on the back these two knobs
one is for the frequency the other ones

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,210
for the sweep control

24
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,509
well there's a resistor that

25
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,040
assaults the range limit and a capacitor
along with other resistors on the board

26
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,689
itself

27
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,810
and that's what actually sucks the
frequency range when the wave itself

28
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,430
goes out

29
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,210
it's a square wave output above the
timer and it's reasonably couple to a

30
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,079
power amp

31
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,500
and the ground is DC biased through
resonator choke

32
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,720
the square wave is a

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,210
then fed through a transducer answers
worth

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:03,159
resonating coral parallel combo tension
between the transducer tuning capacitor

35
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,530
and inductance makes

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,209
a sinusoidal wave pattern that peaks at
around twenty five killers

37
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,940
to how this way if it has peak to peak
voltage

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,640
higher than the original square wave the
transducer

39
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,349
will use all those voltages to make the
higher sound pressure level seeing

40
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:26,879
and that's when the neighbors are quiet
now the power itself

41
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,970
obligor nights just double A batteries a

42
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,150
in its to push button a capacitor a its

43
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,680
c6 on the board gives NEC return path
for the output signal

44
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,629
and power to the driver circuits are
through a decoupling network

45
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:46,518
%uh resistor and capacitor now the
controls the right one

46
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:50,890
is the sweep rate not that's and it's a
FM modulated

47
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,519
Iran goes from a slow to fast chirping
rate and it can be disabled by just

48
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,290
if you can you hear the click that's it
turned off

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,819
on the left on this the frequency itself
going from 10 to 25 coloreds

50
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:09,970
now the effects of it %uh to sweep rates
between five and 20 per second will

51
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,459
cause

52
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,010
dizziness epileptic fits headaches and
nausea

53
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,500
so when I was sitting outside I was

54
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,530
ok I know this is why shouldn't drink

55
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,870
I was sitting in my chair like this but
I had it this way

56
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,690
in my ring finger clip that and I got
shot right now and then

57
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,810
nets closest I can you have ever felt

58
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,200
and Japan oh my god the pain was
unbelievable

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,030
and I had a headache all afternoon but I
was happy as hell to say I got proof it

60
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,030
works you know

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,690
no up the sound pressure measurements

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,030
very from 130 200 s fills eighteen
inches

63
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,360
so differences at Leo and I should for

64
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,370
sleeping he be hurtin

65
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:02,370
now well as you know I would like to set
somebody but I don't see rubble in here

66
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,140
maybe later I don't know

67
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,750
now %uh the LAPD

68
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,790
has a bigger unit not similar to this
that the use

69
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,539
for riots you know civil services things
like them

70
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,419
do how long have they had it for

71
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:26,799
you know no mike is a

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,540
the materials I found about this go back
only maybe to four years for the elite

73
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,100
eating

74
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,669
thing again

75
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:38,500
the french-speaking American so the
punch no one will ever get made fun of

76
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,340
no the LAPD's units

77
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,720
%uh Dave been there so experimenting
with have some the go between 15 to 100

78
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,020
and 1000 Watts

79
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,930
without overheating they've also tested
a full range device that one from 52

80
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,729
20,000 hurts you know there was a report

81
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,050
love one of people who worked on it who
said that they

82
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,020
try to Frank Sinatra record in it and
they could hear it a mile away

83
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:11,030
with words they can make up the lyrics

84
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,290
somebody had to do it

85
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,890
you know one at them no %uh similar
device style

86
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,950
was also use om also love because a
somali on a cruise ship

87
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,539
on november eighth last year and there's
a newspaper headline was called the

88
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,180
cruise ship use a sonic weapon

89
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,310
it was something very similar to this
and are apparently pirates were trying

90
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,880
to

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,300
raid the boat and date you know they
caught him in time

92
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,700
and they got them all of their my just
by someone with this

93
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,290
I'm me if it works it works

94
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,720
so might sit for my part

95
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
want to turn things over to turn in his
first time up

96
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,240
be kind on burning don't want to hear
from you

97
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,420
hi everyone has a

98
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,030
as Evan go little bit nervous for soma

99
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,520
a pretty much

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,729
britches a topic a little bit guess like
that the whole

101
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:23,110
weapons and it's a it's a very
interesting thing within those hackers

102
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,000
we try to

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,920
anything power anything with control
which would have minded or

104
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,270
have have it as a toy so um

105
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:35,979
whatev actually managed to do

106
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,430
if you guys ever heard of power actuated
tools

107
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:43,419
which are actually %uh it's like a
having a full weapon

108
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:48,240
went out having bullets for but it's
pretty much just like

109
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,400
up the power behind

110
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,750
a nail gun pretty much but up actual

111
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,970
gunpowder nail gun and have managed to
actually

112
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,520
modify the gun to create an actual

113
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,669
automated weapon its kinda scary its
kinda scared to say and what is he

114
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:08,320
really is.

115
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,840
but a I was actually gonna bring it here
but I was afraid you guys might get to

116
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,610
scare for

117
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,560
arm know I was

118
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,300
a was actually bring the pulitzer
anything like that so don't get

119
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,040
that scare blood I was actually gonna
show you some presentations and how he

120
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,770
could actually

121
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,219
no money per se I don't show the entire
world

122
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,760
how to do it break I want to show them
how how

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,990
easy it's actually do it in what some
other companies like Phil two-year

124
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,360
a RAM said which are wanted to

125
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,870
corporations are arc shoes competitors
and if they're

126
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,990
you're all over the US all over Europe
and what they actually do is

127
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,200
kinda how to have a Wii

128
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,460
have actually use in third technology
their can technology

129
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,850
n put in the putting

130
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,810
actual consumer parks for the regular
Joe that

131
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,510
you think they're not gonna modern you
think they're not gonna

132
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,020
a go ahead and create something new from

133
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,310
so hopefully he'll get stick actual
machine working

134
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,570
and I could show you some some
screenshots for

135
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,659
is pretty much are it worse

136
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,820
it works just like a regular done
actually arm

137
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,409
you have a cylinder you have you have
the same

138
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,410
parks unseen are location of a gun

139
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,919
it's just whether you actually managed
to do day compress

140
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:38,039
to power within the the Gunpowder

141
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,140
and d make a smaller a smaller

142
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,410
load within the cartridge in the
eliminate the actual

143
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,040
bullet so would you could do if you have

144
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,130
the right machinery on the right tools
at home

145
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,180
a friend callers worry this you could
actually

146
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,890
a you know 50 thing apart figure out how
it actually works

147
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:06,930
up because also order some parts there
are meant for guns

148
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,280
they're not for this kinda weapon Encana
retrofitted

149
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,890
in create your own automatic weapon but

150
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,959
on hopefully we could get a working

151
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,350
own but pretty much

152
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,350
would you try to do it's creepy in
actual cavity

153
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,610
for an actual bullet to people are fit

154
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,190
in the actual device did actually made
it so that

155
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:36,820
if the actual cavity that you have now
only fits

156
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,750
their standards and beer floats so we

157
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,520
we're trying to do is actually water
show you guys

158
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,829
own you're trying to create the same

159
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,300
the same device the same way works

160
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,080
but you're trying to remove it has a
similar

161
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,550
this Center fickle case within the
actual gun

162
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,380
that it compresses the air and a power
that comes out of the the actuals

163
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,939
for the actual load and you

164
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,830
completely remove their part just make
it an entire empty case

165
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,660
and actually buying a appoint 27 caliber
bullets

166
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,430
%uh because that's what they are they're
actually

167
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,050
point 27 color bullets and they actually
fit exactly

168
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:27,209
just exactly like the way a regular
automatic guns would do

169
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,740
you like a a revolver

170
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,760
point 27 caliber revolver point 22 its

171
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,430
so similar seems kinda size Playa

172
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:44,430
hold pictures up a to miss I think

173
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,740
up

174
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,569
okay so he's actually getting everything
working now

175
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:22,570
on point

176
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:01,670
up

177
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,550
our exit this is basically where the
University actually sell this is the

178
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,810
a this is RAM service call the Viper
I'll

179
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,740
Americans I'll

180
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,899
so basically you you have his weapon
that's good it is

181
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:50,329
is basically a weapon it's supposed to
be a nail gun but is actually

182
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,630
you you're able you read some other
things on your

183
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,189
do you think its act is an actual arm
machine-gun you actually buy a machine

184
00:13:58,190 --> 00:13:59,200
gun um

185
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,529
so this weapons like the latest
technologies have actually spend

186
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:04,579
thousands of dollars

187
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:08,120
just like researching how to actually
prevent you from

188
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,339
creating a full automated weapon on but
its pretty much already there

189
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,519
so

190
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,640
so many things you you could do his
actually

191
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,579
this one is actually free its so like
freehand

192
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,980
where you kid they have previous models
were you could you have to push into the

193
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,339
like

194
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:34,370
differ cement and four of flooring and
carpeting in things like that even for

195
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,529
the user for many construction needs but

196
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,520
what other things the usually prevention
it's like from

197
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:45,510
actually shooting yourself so what would
bill due bill

198
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,910
though make you %uh it's like when a gun

199
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,980
when you when you have a gun owners
actually don't use a gun before but

200
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,709
usually

201
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:57,490
rocked the going to get loaded to move
the next load over

202
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,520
the same thing its you have to kinda

203
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,600
get it ready to fire you press it on the
ground he pressed on the

204
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,089
actual surfers are you trying to shoot
and that's gonna make to you know that's

205
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:09,399
gonna

206
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,910
know the actual the next cartridge so

207
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,000
defection eliminating that on this on
this this is the latest wanna be have

208
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,890
actually limited SUV actually shoot
yourself in the foot of your

209
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:26,410
so so

210
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,199
basically the only thing on this this is
the latest model from

211
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,610
from this company it's actually because
Google array never have a computer right

212
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:34,970
now

213
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,880
is actually RAM said on pretty much the
only thing you need to do is just

214
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,420
change the way you actually put the
actual loads

215
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,940
or the actual are home

216
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,000
Kartik basically the cartridge where the
actual

217
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,579
bullets go into and that's the only
thing you had too much to bite the

218
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,579
bullet singers

219
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:02,500
prima Starfire in right away just
basically remove the actual sent

220
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,000
as appease were actually compress that
air that

221
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,339
heat that is actually coming from the
from you know the gunpowder is actually

222
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:11,589
a special gunpowder

223
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:16,540
it's it's like it has no smoke is mostly
powder and is very concentrated

224
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,790
just because it is usually use for
cement so

225
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:23,300
but if you buy the actual one for the
actual ball is a

226
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,550
its X even more powerful than the one
the actually provide

227
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,260
on if you go to next slide

228
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,449
this is some other cartridges we have

229
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:36,870
and up this is we basically had to
modified

230
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,930
home you see the last one it's what

231
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,800
let me go by color like the first ones
like the week is for 12 seconds

232
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,110
absolutely no over stronger in the last
one is like

233
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,490
good okay yeah if you

234
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,089
to the next slide this is how they
actually look like

235
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,839
looks just like a regular bullet doesn't
look like a bull and pretty much

236
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,120
exactly exactly pretty much

237
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,280
on so if you see the tiniest one bearing
a picture this actually won the

238
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,079
the strongest want to see actually
compress if the

239
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,829
beat the chemicals and in this gunpowder
special don't matter

240
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:20,059
but it's still very very powerful trust
me I'm played around it it's very very

241
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:20,939
powerful

242
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,140
on because it looks like

243
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:28,820
this is actually want this is something
the documentation

244
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,700
one in the actual slices we have you can
actually or the order the parts

245
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,480
you can see with the actual bullet or
load goes then

246
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,290
you guys you did just the middle there
guests either

247
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,710
its should be number

248
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,120
27 just the burn diversity in 27 this
with the actual

249
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,340
loads will go in its pretty much a
semi-automatic it's like to press the

250
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:54,939
trigger

251
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,280
the next logo in fire you press the
trigger again

252
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,340
no fire next rigor its its automatic gun

253
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,760
pretty much what within their own
standards

254
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,059
it's an excellent this is my favorite

255
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,379
you

256
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,130
you can see how complicated it is
actually

257
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,190
this is a Hilti direction is a Swedish
company

258
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,550
they're very very famous for their
technology specially

259
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,678
some other things they've actually done
are amazing some

260
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:30,720
like this you could fire up to you
thirty thousand rounds

261
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,160
with this with this machine will
actually overheating

262
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,360
likely to actually arm sorta burning
yourself

263
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,020
while shooting the face so believe
actually done they've actually

264
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:47,820
me to that the change so im

265
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,919
some programmers we can really shoot
yourself this is the 1i was talking

266
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,790
about we've you can really shoot
yourself

267
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:58,440
but on it's very easy could very easily
Mont the actual machine

268
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,050
a I llego which like I know people here
that want to see

269
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,480
man you should just pose the actual
months but it's like

270
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,740
on really scare their 15-year-old their
16-year-old goes in buys this on the

271
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,250
story

272
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,420
which you can goes to the store by
section

273
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,250
being and was only cause like a hundred
dollars and you could

274
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,190
pretty much have an automatic weapon
that's what I'm afraid about was

275
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,970
actually gonna go and show you guys had
actually dealers way

276
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,350
kinda scare myself a little bit on

277
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,830
the next slide this is actually

278
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,210
the 1i was actually telling you guys is
very it's a very tiny

279
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,360
on load but its very powerful

280
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,150
its thick the actual every every
cartridge as a collar

281
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,290
and this is this is specifically for
that the last line that I showed you

282
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,340
that special

283
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,080
lt1 its its would basically doing this
is like a special

284
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,909
special kind it's called the purple the
purple load

285
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,040
it's very very powerful on

286
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,170
I I sorta scare the neighbors when I was
playing around with this one so

287
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,170
it's very very loud enough to wake up

288
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,940
your entire neighborhood social our
lives very very quiet so

289
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,390
its index this is actually some other

290
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,880
if I'm just showing you some love them
if you if you know anything about

291
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,220
actual weapons are actual %uh you could
actually see where the trigger

292
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,429
dessus cylinder that number number three

293
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:32,440
so when you actually remove on and
basically

294
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,059
hassle wave actually sorta

295
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:41,600
once you hit the trigger any actually
exploder

296
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,040
that you know creates that makes the
load

297
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,620
explode election early I'll

298
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,830
gets already it like automatic mode
we're actually

299
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,970
come back soon X necks Lotus are
shooting

300
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,140
and we have you decide this is

301
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,520
the actual to see how the brown looks
like this is exactly what it looks like

302
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,350
in this is that

303
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:09,690
to purple 1i was actually talking about
it is very very powerful

304
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,100
League if you take the actual lower part
just use a powder

305
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,840
to certainly play around July four you
wanna do

306
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,918
you know your own little chemical
explosion whatever you keep you could

307
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:24,400
because senator just like put it next to
anything that is you know

308
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,059
any kind of heat source well just like
low itself up

309
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:31,770
its it's just its very very powerful

310
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:38,470
are I

311
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,029
I

312
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:49,029
it so they slide this is basically the
1i was seen as my favor you can see her

313
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,230
rugged it is

314
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:55,899
you can see how sorta it's me it's meant
to be

315
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:59,450
to be rugged into sieve seen he'd

316
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:02,659
and you know just like be able to
actually

317
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:07,880
go to cement in sorta someone you know
not

318
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,960
hurt the the actual persons arm while
you're doing it

319
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,649
so you kiss you can kinda see a couple

320
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:18,490
actually IDEX a blurred out the actual
brands you guys and

321
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:22,360
you know model number see but it's a
very

322
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,450
your product placement yeah I'm sorry
guys you

323
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,549
but I

324
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:35,320
but you guys to see how it actually
looks like

325
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,908
and if you see this the second everette
the second red

326
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:43,889
arm strike its struck like that second
phase

327
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,929
thread deaths were actually loads go go
through its like rain-x your head

328
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,250
and you could put a tooth into 10,000
loads

329
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,269
in in there in just shoot away

330
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:59,720
just shoot away its scary X

331
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,889
X did

332
00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:07,740
its right the

333
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,190
this is this is where does my next point
they actually have

334
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:15,730
worse actually a circular collective
revolver they have those kinda loads

335
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,370
with again you have to kinda by the
actual cartridges and replace those

336
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,460
and put your own bullets on

337
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,039
in pretty much have up to you have

338
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:32,350
to 30002 from know from but

339
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,870
300 loads 10,000 loads and within that

340
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,200
cavity it's very powerful so basically
conceivably

341
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,639
all the beeper and all the power behind
a bullet it's pretty much was

342
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:47,090
pushing you know I'm pushin does make
the nails into

343
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:51,240
cement or or whatever you you pretty
much replacing that bullet

344
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,340
your just having that power %uh

345
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,439
you know that push to use hammering away

346
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,510
and that's what they're that so they
wrecked that the technology div

347
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,460
you know they can prove that technology
having it just a simple gonna be made it

348
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,090
so that's a

349
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,189
is a to love the you know tool for

350
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,629
construction but yet it's it's so
powerful that if you're able to

351
00:24:12,629 --> 00:24:16,419
moderate you know how to do it you know
enough about weapons your

352
00:24:16,419 --> 00:24:19,850
to pretty much do this on X excite

353
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,730
this is one other I forget her

354
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:30,730
forget to remove a friend there Vita

355
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,299
pretty much you can see the entrance a
on the actual

356
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:38,120
on the actual gun were you could it's
basically it's where those

357
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,159
met mountable cartridges words like it

358
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,620
because it's like 10 Towson loads like
goes

359
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:49,690
up like this just melted like a later
regular a.m. sexy nurse unlike actually

360
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,100
fixing those on the bottom

361
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,240
it is or don't top religious girl you
know just go

362
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,669
want to 34 likely you know one after
another

363
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,850
and on the bottom is physically actually
store although

364
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,820
all the nails you know the nails or
whatever you actually putting into the

365
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,689
cement or

366
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:12,200
yeah next slide go back

367
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,250
well

368
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,820
its did get the barrel

369
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,860
is actually have been further with its
the it's actually

370
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,409
meant for a lot more than that cuz
you're firing so much in years leading

371
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:29,419
up to the metal

372
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,639
every time you fire cyl your

373
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:36,899
you're creating basically you actually
need someone melting metal every time he

374
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:37,590
fired

375
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,429
this is a very heavy machine is a very
heavy things its

376
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,260
so what portable but is very heavy its
actually when the reasons why did bring

377
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,990
it here so so

378
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,269
pretty much you can see

379
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:54,389
what is actually missing you could see
was actually is which is just the bullet

380
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:58,070
itself and the other cartridges just you
know that

381
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,168
that loaded they're actually sonya but
it's pretty much

382
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:05,059
just missing a bullet next slide

383
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:08,928
services but I was talking about

384
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:12,419
you know racking the gun basically when
you

385
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,240
wracked the top in you the next load
goal is

386
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,389
the same mechanism that they have you
you

387
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:23,610
does semi-automatic you have to Rep
sorta push it into the ground

388
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,179
or kinda like pulling back the usually
have a good I think you could push it

389
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:29,000
back in

390
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,960
it's ready for fire industry which is
like a diet which exact same mechanism

391
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,710
and then once you fire I'll go forward
again and then you have to push it

392
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,940
you know back again I'll go for it you
have to push back get

393
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,270
is very much put it out a manic the one
at the first leather showed you

394
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,289
it's actually just just hit the push
just hit

395
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,570
you're firing 10,000 rounds

396
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,889
so be careful excite

397
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:02,860
this is actually not forget again forget
to

398
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:06,039
remove the brand their viz use

399
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:09,529
you just to see how heavy this thing
looks you know how

400
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,529
how even mechanical we could see how

401
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,889
you know it's very it's a very bulky
thing

402
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:18,909
harm actually got this picture from
e-bay

403
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,270
sleaze so

404
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,350
but you could you can see you mean it
should

405
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,360
if you go back to documentation you some
research in

406
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,340
take a look at this you you could
actually take the whole thing apart

407
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,770
within two seconds

408
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,899
and it's like has its own the cylinder

409
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:39,619
which which goes is basically the whole

410
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:43,419
you see the whole front the whole plaque
peas in front actually just comes out

411
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:46,720
just pull it out and you can see the
entire go from there you could play

412
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,480
around as much as you can

413
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,669
I i'm not going to go into details re
you no worries

414
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,710
you actually play around with a gun so
xlite

415
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,619
finished much it %uh you guys have any
questions

416
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:06,619
well okay

417
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,220
I'll check okay you keep saying it's

418
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,170
automatic weapon you cock once and then
you can to 10,000 rounds without pulling

419
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:23,770
the trigger

420
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,809
the first one the first one that I
showed you the first slide if you go

421
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:27,790
back to the first light

422
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,799
down actually you're able to do that
want just point it is just

423
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:35,929
research are you deserve have on the
construction site %uh to you will see

424
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:36,400
deep

425
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,559
LCD time basically you can read it

426
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:43,740
is actually known you there it's easy to
read it will save you time

427
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,870
said a quick question um

428
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,720
not that I not that I would ask you to
go into detail or anything but

429
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,630
dumb the manufacturers really have any
kind have obstacles they bring your lady

430
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:57,640
do is actually one of the things that
I've actually what are you guys

431
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,419
you guys to ask if you do have some some
things that usually you can buy the

432
00:29:01,419 --> 00:29:02,080
loads

433
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,918
unless you're saying he should have a
license in certain states but states

434
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,110
like Delaware which is like the

435
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:11,700
what are free states the to buy anything
you want on

436
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,440
or Florida some seems like that they're
actually

437
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,970
you could buy it anywhere even places
like in Long Island which

438
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,360
a I don't want to mention but you could
buy some below to go even axe Friday

439
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,169
so and what about like technical
obstacles like is it is a difficult

440
00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:27,870
Ahmad

441
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:34,870
for like a it's actually not that
difficult isn't the basic design based

442
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:37,340
on

443
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,350
actually firing are treated instead

444
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,799
the cartridge fires just and so do you
actually get

445
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,490
takeout stint as the Pistons you have to
take out the person yes

446
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:55,490
that so I'm gonna set you you could get
them

447
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,910
you can actually get to that point 27
points 22 ever suggested

448
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,960
really wanna play with the big big guns
victorious go for

449
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,480
point 27 its computer

450
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,710
%uh would you be my fits

451
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:14,400
you

452
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,210
you have to figure it out like during
modding there you have to research all

453
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,770
this stuff before you do any other

454
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,790
don't say anything expressive

455
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,720
okay so you built a gun and you now have
in your possession a fire cable

456
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,990
discharging 22 or 27 caliber rounds

457
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,090
do a firearms licence because if not

458
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:40,690
their pride people here want to talk to
you hey have you seen

459
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:44,800
I'm actually not on the pull of ABC nada
I'm actually not

460
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,809
this is very hard to see you know the
attack I

461
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:50,950
yesen to tell me you know sir just let
you guys know

462
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,720
have to research the legality of give it
that have you researched

463
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,160
legality %uh of times and haven't really
shown you had

464
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,370
mark the actual things I don't have it
with me Vegas where actually them bring

465
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:02,919
itself

466
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:06,090
I don't actually own one yes

467
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,880
not I don't know we're talking about
guide

468
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,530
well if you don't own one and maybe you
can tell me how accurate it is

469
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:19,629
just because %uh you the the barrel

470
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:24,169
its it's not a rifle barrel I would
assume again you don't forget it do

471
00:31:24,169 --> 00:31:28,530
pretty much whatever you want your your
your you could monitor to your needs

472
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,870
it's let's say that alright

473
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:36,669
what kind of a we can arrange in would
you say stopping

474
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:43,440
para you get with this web Alliance is
running at you with a hundred yards away

475
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,440
you open fire wears a going down I'm not
going to incriminate myself I'm not of

476
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:58,679
I was kinda impressed with the 10,000
round capability

477
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,590
yeah how many rounds per minute is I
don't I don't know

478
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,300
actually don't know you see they have a
rating around three minutes as

479
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:13,300
I don't know what is the approximate
muzzle velocity

480
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:18,040
clear

481
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,020
well I'm gonna pass it up to Leo his
neck so

482
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:29,020
it's very much gonna close and I hope
you guys enjoy the talks yeah

483
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,500
neurological systems %ah the problem is
that I lessons of Spinoza

484
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,230
have the exact manufacturers but I can
find out for them Mehran

485
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,810
but I'll talk more general terms
basically

486
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,570
um 96 odd was a report published

487
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:49,060
I ever done in the RGR

488
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,800
or GT said nothing very specific on

489
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,530
it was he's a guy who was by paralyzed
from neck down

490
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:01,160
an evil to move which is the mission
from houses

491
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,080
and are so always done this him on sears
for an operation

492
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,140
were I for need nurses taken from his
kneecaps

493
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,740
I'm from his knees wrists and as
kneecaps and I

494
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:17,970
I put into these to glass combs

495
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:21,520
from across the two about and H

496
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,510
maybe long and implanted into the back
to send

497
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,660
me that something new for sex area

498
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,120
a more for sex and hot tub so BC

499
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,190
have those who are a those basically

500
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,040
arts was attached to it which were
hooked up to the my house and put on a

501
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,770
TC

502
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:44,480
efforts and this incident %uh

503
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,780
since in there so since and up

504
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,770
smart for sucks were firing Violi the
mouse just

505
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,910
you know finally move around the screen
but after about two months

506
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,860
I his because he what look at the screen

507
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,900
%ah and became a constant and and the
words

508
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,220
his brain restructured itself

509
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,110
for that is the out of control the mouse
scientists

510
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:13,110
to months control the

511
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:17,129
other Masterson on them on them

512
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:20,580
just by thinking about you %uh so

513
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,770
now alive sue lot more motions Dunham

514
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,129
than his is moving your and is clean now

515
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,750
I if you want to search for I just look
for class cones

516
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,918
and I think she died see that on GR up
crosses

517
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,040
on the Internet you'll find a lot %uh
said other things differently now in

518
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,100
2000

519
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,250
and one accompany called

520
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,560
on a Nero arm I'm

521
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,889
suburbs nynex credits link all the
neural motor first

522
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,590
first prosthesis which is %uh a

523
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,170
I it's a simple device tonight last
cones from

524
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:04,240
actual are show that's implanted

525
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,470
and into the brain and and it shows

526
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,750
itself to the a semi random

527
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,860
mall random up nerve firing patterns

528
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:18,950
and so it basically takes one GTR

529
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,129
I went to Jiu Jitsu months to mid

530
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,580
that maybe two weeks to do n

531
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,090
in the words it's the same facts but on
excelling in

532
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,380
in like fashion and there are other
companies

533
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,510
itself devices like the as ago have an

534
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,730
I based the it's an Overton

535
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,040
EG and measures the the state up the

536
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,360
the the frequency of the brain waves

537
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,680
at the the up

538
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,040
the baby to stay in which is in normal
waking state the out the season just to

539
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,460
see me close your eyes

540
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,780
and and the other the to see which is

541
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,160
sleep state and Delta State which is
have the non

542
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,879
drinks each day and own their variation

543
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,300
and the B-two status to see with the

544
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,060
with the highest frequency of a other
than a place for these

545
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,250
and how %uh the have been device works
is

546
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:22,120
basically animated state he didn't this

547
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,390
vet just by consciously can actually
answer

548
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,620
you can see if your brain if you don't
be some ups and EG

549
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,180
so biofeedback it by monitoring being
ways you can

550
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,609
kinda name control over others

551
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,620
the frequency that their coming out have
and does basically

552
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:46,470
into a once Watson under control

553
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,690
sightly the brim with variation you can
use it as a control devices and the

554
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,290
device

555
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,550
very simple South like maybe three
commands

556
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:58,970
because you can only have used the three
states on it it's not very sensitive

557
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,050
but it's a it's quite simple

558
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,550
I mean its but and allows

559
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,040
a small mound and for it to be a cheat
just by wearing half and half that saw

560
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,400
Sophie C I would also possibles

561
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,220
there is awesome others others in a
mansion basically

562
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:22,530
when I if you take a scorpion for
example

563
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,950
and %ah and and sits parked

564
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,930
what on a living scorpion take electrons

565
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:35,359
put into its fine I don't burn the exact
areas but a

566
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,390
and you a total city before had before

567
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,830
and make the government around

568
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,230
hokum make him this emotions

569
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,370
and stop gas the Scorpion so he dies

570
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:52,910
that any finally damage I'm other than
suffocation

571
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,339
I and book the flight playback via

572
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,310
the recording before the the nurse ozell

573
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:04,640
and bring in the brain and the spinal
some dying out about

574
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,970
thirty-seconds but he played that for
that time

575
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,350
on school repeat the motions is what's
been happening as

576
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,950
very much composes for being said before
giving me some

577
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:20,890
to the spine and its fine routes in

578
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:25,450
after the russians osea thing you like
no wanna play dat unions

579
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,380
and it's been offline were there's a
adult

580
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,540
you can wear no you paralyzes

581
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:36,670
word a/c up you spinal cord is

582
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:40,060
some I suffered let's say over here so

583
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,480
the porn the spinal cord still attached
the brain

584
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,850
has electrodes implanted into it

585
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:50,210
each wires on the channel and its
leaders i think im

586
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:55,180
using thing was 200 channels

587
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:59,509
to tax time for the spine the bottom
part the party its

588
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:03,430
their action the separation

589
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,799
and so you ladies the a skill set

590
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,150
signals from the top of the spine the
bottom part

591
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,800
and allowing for sins paralyzed exempt
from the waist down

592
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,390
swap not for long but the muffin

593
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,850
from a front these about a thousand
steps which

594
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,270
so you can't really walking all
otherwise

595
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:27,720
as a be good rock the problem with that

596
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,930
as when you lot things into spine

597
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:34,690
Adam kinda kills in urs

598
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:38,250
I last saw min I wish you could find

599
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,740
article I was looking for as I was gonna
make this is looking for this article

600
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:46,410
%ah leave last year sinus found someone
to

601
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,370
I keep cell nerve cells that

602
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:53,490
link if you take in their soul and
attach it to a silicon

603
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,100
simple to to silicon into

604
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,549
basically die action bad

605
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,580
a few hours they discovered a way to
keep them alive

606
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:08,940
and I don't know the specifics of the
stanza find that I can finance I'm

607
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,480
for that discovery is falling only to a
lot more um

608
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,640
improvements and that not doing this
fine one anything was saying before the

609
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,089
class comes

610
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,390
%uh because Adam

611
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,799
you know government you from getting
damage

612
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,990
%ah that's it sorry for the
generalization issue

613
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,460
seen you around in the conference a
better more thorough

614
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,590
specific preferences for up

615
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:42,330
so that's it yes

616
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:48,080
so questions against a

617
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,390
yes I have a question it sounds to me
like

618
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:55,290
they're talking about a central path to
communicate to the brain

619
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:59,350
live via Vegas nerve or something like
that I knew

620
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,080
epileptics have an implant to send the
signal

621
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,009
and it almost looks like it's the path
is sorted and found

622
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,030
its what signal to send is a your sense
of what's happening

623
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,660
are my sons was just up notwithstanding
the Sun

624
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,100
mall our butts and all the singles

625
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,420
these the since we can goner so small we

626
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,760
Caminata large amounts currently and we
can go spinal nerve cells

627
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,440
yet up just soo make

628
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,870
a lot so electrical relays system for
the

629
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:36,049
little signals up the nerves

630
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,859
farmers dozens as a millions in errors
in

631
00:41:39,859 --> 00:41:42,859
on the 20 channels that's it doesn't
work

632
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:46,790
very well but it but that does work
enough that you can walk around for a

633
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,560
bit

634
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,890
well yeah thats whats it's basically not
what's in the scary

635
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:55,650
but scary all possible symbols that's
the goal

636
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,180
