entry page everything managing your
company's intellectual property

6
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,700
introduction to IT security

7
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,700
number 35 de nuestra morning

8
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,860
can you everybody you know came back
there aren't great things from out this

9
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,720
morning I've got

10
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,400
gonna give if i can assume backgrounds I
work with one small businesses love for

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,470
medium-size businesses

12
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,819
I'm doing defense consulting and I am
working a lot stranger

13
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,799
serve raise awareness in the security
issues and and so the business

14
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,329
perspectives on those issues

15
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:17,490
with what a great technical talks at
this conference

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,889
and those things are very important and
it's important to you commuters ideas

17
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:26,229
to managers and business people in a way
that they can make sense if in

18
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:29,639
in a way that they can see the value in
and some other things that we know are

19
00:01:29,639 --> 00:01:30,429
very valuable

20
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:34,420
very important so special fans how many

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,740
non any non-technical business people
here

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,810
okay any managers people like that

23
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,060
a crime there are a lot of I think I'm
really have

24
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,759
we have consulted the security
consultants IT people about the SU

25
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,619
students

26
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:54,889
just here for fun okay too early to
answer

27
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:58,449
I'm so I'm gonna try to

28
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,859
you this move it towards all all the
different Tom people we have

29
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,529
managers as well as some more technical
issues

30
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:09,288
love this is a very basic overview and I
give us to to small businesses to

31
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:13,210
to companies and professionals primarily
we talk about minutes on the issues

32
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,050
that revolve around speaking to them
about the size shoes

33
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,060
first thing we have is

34
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,230
data is really the most valuable asset
that companies have today

35
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,260
I don't think a lot of businesses
realize this but Tom

36
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,130
this is read it is really the only thing
and then watch property is really the

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,630
only thing that you can't get back if
it's stolen

38
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,010
or if it's if it's corrupted anyway you
have insurance for inventory

39
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,079
I kinda think so information technology
doesn't really provide strategic man

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,320
advantage for companies anymore it sort
of the norm

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,600
especially because of all the global
competition we have I'm

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,750
we have computers have become really
commodity

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,680
and it's really normal for for most
companies to be fairly up to date with

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,690
technology at least

45
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,070
to a certain you with companies really
to see the status quo is as we know is

46
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,060
through innovation

47
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,370
and using technology to add value to
their

48
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,370
products and services when customer see
that there's an added value that gives

49
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,520
an incentive to do business

50
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,250
company versus another course already
here knows

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,450
why security is critical we have
internal threats attraction most

52
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,970
comments is a big misconception among
businesspeople

53
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,850
that external threats are the most
common but that's really not the case

54
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,049
we do have external threats obviously
and then we have some the ethical

55
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,310
and regulatory compliance issues that
our companies are facing now is one

56
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,470
screaming from the government on

57
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,620
on these issues so it's something that
businesses are very concerned with

58
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:41,510
security really must be a cultural value

59
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,910
any organization that embraces it
companies

60
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,270
especially smaller businesses try to
sort of passion on you know the by

61
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,860
firewall me think they're all set

62
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,040
you know that you some password
maintenance or something like that its

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,780
think they're in the clear by spending
should really reflect

64
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,260
if you're going to invest time and money
into protecting our most valuable assets

65
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,019
should spend the time and money that it
takes to actually do that properly

66
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,210
process is also need to be adapted to
fit that new model secure if the company

67
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,930
decides to embrace security needs to

68
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,340
it's a change the way it does business
and also collaboration

69
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,569
between teams there's a lot of issues
collaborating

70
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:22,280
$3.92 per min managers in the company so
it's very critical

71
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,610
that people work to build those
relationships as I mentioned

72
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,880
security remains to be part of every
step process

73
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,639
it's not an afterthought it's not so for
the final stop the sea

74
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:39,520
training should also be a priority

75
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,630
for companies is a big one it's very
difficult to get companies to spend

76
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,320
money on this

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,580
because it's very difficult for them
measuring sir return on their investment

78
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,180
its

79
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,790
a business owner doesn't want to send
has our employees

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,230
to after seminar something like that on
security

81
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,540
when he can measure balanchine white

82
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,220
we're where that money is is actually
helping his business are helping him

83
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,790
make more money by training does target

84
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,669
the biggest security risks that there is
a match people people are always

85
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:12,870
into especially internally the biggest
risk for any organization and that

86
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,460
something bad

87
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,210
that this is a hard time dealing with

88
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,310
training also has to be
organization-wide has to be consistent

89
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,880
cross different apartments hands across
different levels

90
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,550
of of structure organization it also has
to provide enough technical detail to

91
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,110
give

92
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,389
employees serve a big picture overview
of what how how this technology

93
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:36,139
processes work in their business what
they're doing

94
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:39,990
wrong or what they're doing right insert
a grand scheme idea

95
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,990
by not too technical Vatuvei write it
off as something that is someone else's

96
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,950
responsibility

97
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,860
we all know non-technical people tend to
write off

98
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,960
it. suggestions because they think
that's

99
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,680
an IT job security is a job he did and
that's not the case

100
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,220
it's the job everyone in the
organization fact that the department

101
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,450
can do all at once

102
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,539
if the employees are writing password on
sticky notes

103
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,660
and throwing out confidential
information about running than

104
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,350
best farm runs and can help you

105
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,639
we look at security also serving
insurance model insists aware used to

106
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,020
describe it to companies as well

107
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,930
and this exhorted shows them why
prevention is actually cheaper

108
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,120
fan cleanup there's a reluctance to
spend money on security as I mentioned

109
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,240
because it's difficult to quantify those
benefits

110
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,330
good example his recent study I saw done
by Gartner

111
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,729
they said that's protecting customer
records

112
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,990
of by encrypting them costs about six
dollars per record to do

113
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,020
its order preventative measure obviously

114
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,520
and there's a ninety dollar minimum they
found in their study

115
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,349
a record for cleaning up any mishandled
lost data

116
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,840
so a casa company eighty four dollars
more to clean up after breach that would

117
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,080
actually implement

118
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,389
encryption technology at the beginning
you've probably heard of the storm via

119
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:02,250
laptop

120
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,169
I was recently recovered this is kind of
a funny story the government

121
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,000
is saying oh what we found this laptop
and we're we're happy to report that

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,880
forensic evidence shows that

123
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,389
nobody probably access the data well
most of us know that's not really

124
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:19,889
accurate statement can't really tell of
herders been copied or something like

125
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,650
that

126
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,490
mother were twenty six and a half
million social security numbers on this

127
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,550
laptop

128
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,080
and if you look at a product like PGP
Desktop which cost 199 dollars for my

129
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,930
sons

130
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,580
I'm this would pretty much what you set
up some kind of whole disk encryption so

131
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,560
that you can store this big database

132
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,889
on this laptop bankrupted the recovery
investigation costs

133
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,110
and forensics don't know what they are
but you have to spend $10 million three

134
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,610
hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars
to send mail

135
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:51,740
to all the people who lost their
information so touched in postage

136
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,729
out of the pay for a free postage but
that's what it would cost

137
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,169
sirs internal fresco again come
misconceptions are that external threats

138
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,620
are actually the greatest prosperous
risk

139
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,919
and that security is only a technical
issue

140
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,729
your thing is people think that hackers
biggest threat as well Bill Gates think

141
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:14,180
Zac

142
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:20,330
looks like and so we see these sort of
media images obviously

143
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,300
of hacking and tech people

144
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,410
so the reality is that most security
threats are internal or the region 8

145
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,690
internally

146
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:33,088
employees accessories me want to scream
employees here but I can stifle

147
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,839
time intentional or unintentional miss
you so bad validated by employees

148
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,219
internally

149
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,440
houses in the social engineering
weaknesses that we see you know

150
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,420
talk a little bit more about that later
but these are basically used for data

151
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,140
collection for espionage

152
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:51,610
within a company or from the outside and
this problem really is

153
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:58,610
purely based on a lack of training and
awareness in this area

154
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,600
something on technical aspects are
really under emphasized by businesses

155
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,279
training ices I mention implementing
good policies and

156
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:12,260
forcing those and auditing and process
evaluation

157
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,310
so the external threats that we see how
I can breeze through this

158
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,250
you know technical components that we
have obviously very important passwords

159
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:24,350
firewalls antivirus software appliances
and backup devices are critical

160
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,529
components tiny

161
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,160
any good security strategy you have

162
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,089
things are you use to protect against
fast loss of data backup procedures

163
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:38,670
some kind of redundancy you have an
offside to Grandma same hearing going on

164
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,620
your data access to recover if there's
an issue I'm

165
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,529
I'm and security assessments are also
really important should be done

166
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,089
regularly by

167
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:51,040
experienced Africa people ands should
always include training for employees

168
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,969
and this should be done

169
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,740
on a pretty regular basis to keep
employees up to date on some other

170
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,230
issues

171
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,350
just to give them again a big picture
you have what they need to be looking

172
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,250
out for

173
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,209
we seen I was in some cases a magical
issues with privacy

174
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:10,880
and confidentiality awesome very bad PR
for some of these companies

175
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,170
Citigroup lost 3.9 million pens for
debit cards they had to you

176
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,969
cancel transactions all over Europe for
sure pretty times because

177
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,830
these numbers were stolen trust funds
private the most famous example

178
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,529
hundred forty-five thousand personal
records were stolen from there actually

179
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,230
were

180
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,120
given our its in it for tweets you

181
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,790
to a group or a few people who were
going to use them for identity theft

182
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,790
reasons and card systems which is a big
processor credit cards

183
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,790
lost forty million account numbers

184
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,500
so there really isn't a better business
motivator for companies

185
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,580
van these examples in this is where
we're seeing a big focus on legislation

186
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,410
security issues in the media

187
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,959
because these are very bad these are
very bad PR issues for these companies

188
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,050
so we sing the government response
church really worth some movies

189
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,970
we have had but which is self-insurance
Portability and Accountability Act

190
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,070
and this is you know this has a wide
ranging implications for trance

191
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,779
company's health care providers

192
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,070
anybody who has to do with was personal
healthcare information

193
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,720
we've gota which is geared towards
financial service companies

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,680
love the same restrictions on how they
can use data

195
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,209
and then we have california's SP 1386
and this is

196
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:30,790
requiring that any company that uses
data about a citizen of California

197
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,990
has to report that publicly this bill
was being considered by

198
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,560
number other states in different forms
there are

199
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,290
other pending is legislation in pretty
much every state so

200
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:47,140
these the Zacks typically have pretty
non specific requirements though not a

201
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,680
lot of technical detail

202
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,310
but they are getting less flexible on
restrictions and penalties are going

203
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,690
more severe there are also a lot of

204
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,240
very stringent requirements for doing
business in the EU

205
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,580
on the they basically have the EU has
directors at its sites

206
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,690
which cent minimum requirements for
national laws in the EU countries in

207
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,540
member states

208
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,719
these are supposed to enable information
sharing between the countries so that

209
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,970
there's sort of a guarantee your privacy

210
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,540
between countries may share information
companies in those countries

211
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,899
and they do have specific requirements
and data security is opposed to you

212
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:25,589
american legislation which does not as I
mentioned

213
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,209
they're pretty strict an the enforcement
is very bureaucratic

214
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:34,260
its is very restrict for powerful

215
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,870
when we for american businesses to do
business with EU countries even though

216
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,370
the

217
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,399
we don't have the same standards as EU
countries is to be a safe harbor

218
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,550
organization

219
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,920
and what this means is it allows

220
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,080
countries allows american businesses to
be on a list of safe harbor

221
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,360
organizations which allow them to you

222
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,010
certify that they have met certain
privacy and security

223
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,959
requirements imposed by EU countries

224
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,050
the US government commerce lists the is
and

225
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,480
see are there are seven principles of
this

226
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,870
the security that they have to adhere to
notice choice onward transfer security

227
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:16,920
Tegrity enforcement access each of these

228
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,870
sort of outlines a few requirements
about how companies can use data how it

229
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,950
needs to be stored

230
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,570
how it should be transmitted and how
access should be granted in tonight to

231
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:29,350
it

232
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,980
there are certification letters required
on an annual basis companies have to

233
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,790
renew their certification

234
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,240
and they have to publish privacy
policies are fairly detailed

235
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,640
just stating that their securities rules

236
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,670
will be more in social engineering
really social engineer

237
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,890
balls around taking information that you
don't have access to have

238
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,410
and usually this is used just through
very simple means to see

239
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,719
over the telephone in person my email

240
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,000
any that its order stems from

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,670
our willingness to help one another
especially in a business environment if

242
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,339
if you call in other departments and you
complain about a problem you're having a

243
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,200
lot of people when a company can lead to
the same issues

244
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,190
the heat the same people hey he same
bosses and that kind of thing so

245
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,810
it's it's easy to manipulate that that
desire and get people to do which one

246
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,250
useless information which many employees
consider to be

247
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,709
unimportant is often not and usually
social engineer

248
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,220
balls around obtaining one piece love
that information at a time so you start

249
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,170
building

250
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,230
I'm sort of a senate information you can
use that information

251
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,920
to sound like an employee of the company
your you're trying to manipulate

252
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,600
if you know with the lingo is internally
what some other numbers are the

253
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,310
identification codes that the use
especially

254
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,570
in high-security places like banks hand

255
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,120
healthcare institutions that can be very
valuable

256
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,079
and some people are easily giving out
that information

257
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,470
mission dumpster diving sure many view
from my roof

258
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,560
companies do not do enough to protect
your information safe thrown out

259
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,550
and emotional appeals are really what
work best in these situations and people

260
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,579
are fairly

261
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,209
able to to this even the best social
engineers are vulnerable to being

262
00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:19,260
manipulate in this way so the best
offense here again is

263
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,709
is training making employees aware of
what information is sensitive

264
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,310
and what is not she policies regarding
the different types of information

265
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,510
exists an organization in this doesn't
have to be on

266
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,709
very bureaucratic process he just needs
to be clear and well-defined

267
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:38,550
and well communicated to employees they
should be encouraged always identify

268
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,779
people through internal means hands

269
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:44,779
just training them to realize that
technology can solve the issue

270
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,829
and slapping some technology on the
problem doesn't really fix

271
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,470
doesn't fix the room have that problem
when I say

272
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,810
identify people through internal means
that means

273
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,100
call somebody back in and an internal
extension if they're asking for

274
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,130
sensitive information just to verify
that their employees of the company that

275
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,120
they have the

276
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,920
if they have the access rights you can
authenticate them

277
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,130
as someone who is who is authorized

278
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,550
information PR deception is a great book
written by Kevin Minnick

279
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,680
and I will I'm Simon and outlines

280
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,019
has a lot of great stories reads a lot
like fiction it's a very very quick read

281
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:27,779
my great stories but different social
engineering examples why they worked

282
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,820
what should have been done to prevent
them and

283
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,110
is it's an excellent resource really to
to see

284
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:37,410
and there's also a panel today at two
o'clock in area which is

285
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,069
on social engineering highly recommend I
saw it last time

286
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:46,279
it's very interesting should have some
fun experiments there today

287
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,480
I can recover is another big topic for
companies

288
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,990
backup procedures are pretty standard
most people know that you should be

289
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:53,320
running a backup

290
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,269
combines are not really tested on a
regular basis and so

291
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:01,019
when they don't work companies are
usually very surprised hand

292
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,000
usually very bankrupt so the guidelines

293
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,888
on I'm back up got hot summer breeze
through this extra one technical people

294
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:09,650
here

295
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,010
I'm proper media for the size in
candidate you're storing

296
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,839
encryption is very important and on-site
start for crushing

297
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,040
precautions he would take put back up to
25 per se fue something simple like that

298
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,199
its low-cost

299
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,439
lacrosse thing should also should also
have a copy taken outside on a regular

300
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,030
basis I

301
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,918
encourage companies to do that at least
once a week a safe deposit box in a bank

302
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,320
or something like that is a good idea

303
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,409
and also test scenarios what would
happen if you had a fire

304
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,720
which would be able to recover most
viewed how many days with a date with

305
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,669
you lose

306
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:46,840
if your building burned down or or you
lost a backup paper something like that

307
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,580
so

308
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,230
I'm those scenarios really help people
visualize how painful it would be if

309
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,090
if they screwed something

310
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,820
of say business continuity is also going
to be for large organizations can afford

311
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,580
it

312
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,970
IBM has very strong offering there are
other companies HP has an offering in

313
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,990
the services and I'm this allows
companies to mir their servers and data

314
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,120
centers of sight

315
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,390
so they go down there's disaster her can
that kind of thing

316
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:17,540
they can switch over to an outside data
center and be back online

317
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,970
fairly sure appeared time

318
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,230
also disaster plans are good idea
especially if you have designers

319
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,580
or sensitive equipment and prayer is
that a problem

320
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,490
tornado areas and obviously down south
in

321
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,530
during hurricane season there's a lotta
risk that as well

322
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,720
the scenario should also be tested this
is pretty

323
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,100
pretty important hands companies really
need to leverage their budgets to spend

324
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,150
money on the areas that are high-risk
unspent

325
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,270
spend as much money there as possible
and spend less money on areas that are

326
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,110
that are less high-risk I think
companies are reluctant to implement

327
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,340
with these things because

328
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,770
face think there is our partners high
cost involved through the sea the dollar

329
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,559
signs in front

330
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,850
these things and I'm and they don't
realize that it's it's not about

331
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,320
securing everything

332
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,480
as tightly as you can necessarily their
give number servers in your organization

333
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,150
summer gonna happen or something
information than ours so it's important

334
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,870
to just identify with

335
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,559
what those requirements are and budget
appropriately

336
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,629
access control server last main area
talk about

337
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,309
we have pastor guidelines obviously
physical security is very important

338
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:27,760
password is

339
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,260
fairly useless if someone has physical
access to to the machine that they're

340
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,020
dealing with

341
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,620
or administrative access obviously for
some strength requirements important

342
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,530
passwords

343
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,309
for simply second pass was obviously
everybody knows is

344
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,510
is a good idea and auditing the sconce
regularly to make sure that actually

345
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,780
happening

346
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:52,110
also there's sort of a practicality
aspect a lot of these things and that is

347
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,100
pastor should be used for a place to
remember hard to crack and

348
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,669
varies always sort of an issue with that

349
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:04,130
making that practical enough security
firms swamped with calls

350
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,010
got a network server access

351
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,240
graphic I found online here Wireless
weaknesses

352
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,549
are our big concern that some companies
need to be looking at multi-factor

353
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,379
authentication

354
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,799
key fobs and that kinda stuff is is
critical as well

355
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:23,460
i'm for our security areas and physical
security

356
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,429
this is a big one if a building is not
secure your

357
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,679
again your firewalls and do anything for
you

358
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,330
and we all stock granularity permissions
this is just granting the appropriate

359
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,889
level

360
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,250
of permission at different levels of the
organization for different ways

361
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,669
Sony counting Armin doesn't necessarily
need access to

362
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,690
human resource records and vice versa so

363
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,270
each the relationship really define who
should have access to one and for what

364
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,410
reason

365
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,169
and women that access as much as
possible as long as it remains practical

366
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,880
for your organization to do so

367
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,030
be personally have access to the
functionaries which pushed employed

368
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,710
so we look at some other ways to
maximize the benefits like teasing silly

369
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,919
security

370
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:10,070
issues and really the biggest thing is
to identify

371
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,500
so those at risk processes what the
systems are other risk what the data

372
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,049
looks like where does it go how is a
transmitted from one place to the other

373
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,379
who should have access and who really
does have access to a

374
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,850
that there's often a disconnect there
and that's the problem I see

375
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:31,830
in a lot of companies and again
prioritizing spending

376
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,389
high-risk require spending and I should
be a priority for

377
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,539
organizational cultural evolution really
embrace

378
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:43,740
security as a whole not just try to sort
of pattern

379
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:49,610
and implementing strong policies is very
important publishing and forcing them

380
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,179
an acceptable use policy basically
states what's inappropriate use of the

381
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,130
technology and

382
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,410
in an organization how come I like to
use my email families

383
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,030
mileage use my computer when my not
supposed to do with a systems

384
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:07,910
how was access granted in restricted in
energy taxes policy would

385
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,440
outlined who has access to what why
however be limiting or granting access

386
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,750
to the system's

387
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:19,789
email policy again this can be

388
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,299
certain content security standards for
email do certainly not have to be in

389
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:23,870
cryptid

390
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,679
to you enough to contain a certain type
signature

391
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,340
should you use disclaimers that the
enemy number one we'll disclaimers

392
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,189
reused that kind of thing so it's it's
important for companies to look at this

393
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:38,260
is writing these policies the biggest
benefit to this is simply

394
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,900
has me sit down right to sow
communicates only the department's

395
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,500
and see these are the things that we
should be doing and that process itself

396
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:45,919
is

397
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,059
is the most valuable aspect these policy
should be kept up-to-date obviously but

398
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,230
but saying just sitting down outlining
this

399
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,539
shows companies where so many issues are
what they need to do about them and how

400
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:01,200
they need to train employees

401
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,660
data storage policy would would outline
where and how did is actually stored

402
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,809
centrally locally house distributed

403
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,649
and whites in those places and again

404
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:16,799
I can't emphasize this enough cost
effective employee training is really

405
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,799
the best way to deal with a lot of these
situations

406
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,179
employees are biggest risk to accompany
and so that the the money should be

407
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:26,179
spent appropriately in that area

408
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:30,179
buying better fire was great by if you
haven't spent money on training you're

409
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:31,610
probably

410
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,710
probably losing some ground there's sort
of a big picture

411
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,110
reviewed am pleased to have as I
mentioned and

412
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,960
they also need need to be worse social
engineering risks that they face

413
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,630
and really employees should be assuming
that everything's confidential

414
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,600
if you set up your organization where

415
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,710
there's a lack of trust between
Department said that I was a can be

416
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,120
risky scenarios well

417
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,429
by there should certainly be on level of

418
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,460
caution and employees are exercising
when they're giving out information

419
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,679
specially

420
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,570
if it's not in person if it's not
something that they now on the Beacon

421
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:07,960
with Nick

422
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,030
whose identity they can verify

423
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,059
soma conclusions we can make from mass

424
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,320
I'm we shouldn't be surprised that
people are the real problem in

425
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,750
in any technology implementation

426
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,150
the need to be helped to understand not
just learn

427
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,630
what it is that you're trying to teach
them the needy we need to be given

428
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,440
application

429
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,520
movie so they can make these connections
on their own to me using

430
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,080
how little bit information goes a long
way when you have good people and

431
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,120
organizations just honest understand how
the process is work

432
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,120
so teaching them to understand where

433
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,070
business fits in the technology in vice
versa what's the make these connections

434
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,168
for themselves

435
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,289
and then you don't have to give very
specific for technical presentations to

436
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,879
them about

437
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,169
about email Christian or something like
that they're really not interested in

438
00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:55,870
learning

439
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,950
so that makes all process called Mr
Smith women feel like their time is

440
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:02,059
being wasted

441
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:05,570
so gun training awareness should be
periodic it should be

442
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,500
updated on a regular basis based on some
the changing requirements for the

443
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,620
organization

444
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:15,960
and what new threats may be a merge in a
particular field

445
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,770
policy should be accessible to employees
and well communicated as I mentioned

446
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,629
and it's important so simple for moms
well because employees want to feel like

447
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,200
they're part of the process

448
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,419
not just being thrown into a training
session to be given information

449
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,950
let somebody else designed for them so
ask employees

450
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,090
what is it you what are some things that
they're concerned about what

451
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,190
know about what don't they understand
about the organization wouldn't be

452
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,669
understandable technology

453
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:46,250
outfits and business and you probably
surprise us all the answers

454
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,419
auditing and testing is very important
policies and procedures should be

455
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,590
honored in a regular basis just

456
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,480
make sure again as this sounds like
something that's expensive and

457
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
complicated but it's really not
especially if the smaller organization

458
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,659
Thomas doesn't have to be expensive
process backup and recovery should be

459
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:03,870
tested disaster recovery plan should be

460
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,360
test it out scenarios you know if fire
drills in schools here but

461
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,370
companies don't do that kind of thing
i'm for technology and they really

462
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,960
should

463
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,080
security processes and obviously
technical aspects i mean are turning

464
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,299
your equipment is

465
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,900
obviously very critical Rd firewalls a
regular basis making sure that that

466
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,820
kinda stuff is

467
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,230
kept up-to-date firmware software
anti-virus I kinda stuff

468
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,260
and companies really need to be willing
to spend money

469
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,250
despite the fact they might not be able
to measure their return on investment

470
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,390
for some these things

471
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,390
they have to be willing to say we're
gonna spend money on this as a

472
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,980
preventative measures and insurance cost

473
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,710
and right off that way and you can be
comfortable with that

474
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,190
really the best way for them to do this
is to make wise investment of time

475
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,390
for their employees using employees who
are you there

476
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,429
already been paid to work train

477
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:56,700
you're providing training to them having
design policies

478
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,620
having an IT department work with
security issues this is the best way the

479
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,250
company's

480
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,559
and the least expensive ways that
companies can use our resources

481
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,639
not necessarily doesn't necessarily
require you to buy new equipment hire

482
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,100
expensive consultants

483
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,500
just requires you to leverage the
employees you have

484
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,919
make the most out of their are there
current positions and other

485
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,679
internal knowledge of how the company
works arkansan is great because

486
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:24,020
here she can provide and sort of a
bird's eye view the organization

487
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:26,770
they're not green in the organization so
it's not like he's your friend to

488
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,250
identify the problems

489
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,529
exist within an organization but they
also don't have

490
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:35,010
the years experience that workforce
brings to accompany

491
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,740
so they're not able to identify those
problems very important if you have

492
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,080
people coming in from the outside

493
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,220
we're providing these extra levels of of

494
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,260
information that the communicate
regularly interacting with people on the

495
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,679
inside

496
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,080
really try to understand how the company
works before they Star Trek patch

497
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,320
solutions

498
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,168
so with that I'll take any questions

499
00:27:55,169 --> 00:28:00,230
you might have as I said we can talk
about some technical issues or

500
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:03,809
specific business issues I know it's a
big concern to our IT people to

501
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:04,870
communicate with

502
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,270
with companies managers I kinda things
if anybody has any thing is like to

503
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:15,270
asking to have a mic yr

504
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:19,659
I use I kinda want to meet you to
questions

505
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:24,250
from yeah first is could you industry on
the morning giving the

506
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,570
employees the regular Joe the picture on
the issue

507
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,340
structure without a condom leaking
secrets I could be potentially

508
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,920
shots sure arm I guess the best thing

509
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,700
I guess the best thing you can do

510
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,250
come if you if you talk to employees I'm
as far as a big picture when I mean is

511
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:48,730
the employees don't have a good concept
what technology is actually doing for

512
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,400
their business

513
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,890
fayed the they understand the emails a
great thing by

514
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:57,350
it doesn't really make sense to them
email is very sensitive technical issue

515
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,660
and access to your email isn't just the
messages they've been sending about

516
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:01,630
accounting and

517
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,030
using the messages are they're flying
back and forth so

518
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,180
giving them a big picture serve implies
showing them

519
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,540
email is this thing that we have either
internally or for hosted externally

520
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,440
these are the issues that we see we
don't want people to have access to this

521
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,720
email your password is we're

522
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,350
actually protects and access with
servers and technical means that are

523
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,650
used to protect access

524
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,210
but your email password is a very very
sensitive piece of information

525
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,180
your access to your email even if it's a
laptop in a report or something like

526
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,760
that is a very sensitive issue

527
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,830
so that in a big organization we have
people who lose their laptop a new

528
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,629
people

529
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,100
have issues to passwords an R rating
sticky notes with passwords and that

530
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,720
kind of thing

531
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,070
they're made aware of the fact that
those things are sensitive but there are

532
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,439
important to the organization

533
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,450
and their value and so and that makes
him realize it makes me want to the

534
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,080
connections

535
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,570
between how the servers and server the
data shares at the use or whatever it is

536
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,280
that they use network drives or anything
like that how that information is really

537
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,850
the type to the organization as well

538
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,210
so if you're talking to employees in
obviously non-technical

539
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,510
dialogue is really important fide
sitting down from and saying

540
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,710
this is how we use email organizations
is what it does for us

541
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,450
these are the things that are good about
it these are things that are dangerous

542
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,150
about

543
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,520
here's why take these precautions and
here's why

544
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,850
these things are important to you to our
business and so

545
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,850
based on making those connections on
their own Acer realizing that

546
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,090
all of that past I mean this the sounds
obvious to some of us but I was that

547
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,310
password is valuable maybe these are two

548
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,710
you know maybe my should be reading my
computer in the car overnight

549
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:37,650
you know that kind of thing and so you
don't have to cover every scenario

550
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,550
from you don't have to say here's a huge
list of all things that you can do

551
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,700
you just have to say to them here's why
we are protecting this information and

552
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,610
so they now

553
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,280
and they can make the spectrum and my
second question is

554
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,750
um one battle that we've had for quite
some time now

555
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,780
just due to corporate culture and the
fact that on securities non

556
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,520
forefront are CIA octo as well so

557
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,360
other fax executive label your Dom

558
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,570
so you know we're trying to push policy
here it's real frustrating because you

559
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,250
try to

560
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,220
differences or CIA measures so that with
shit does it

561
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:16,910
yes language but you know you're not
looked at as the No

562
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,910
negligible you were negligent introduce

563
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,600
as being IT personnel and

564
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,810
I guess kinda is my questions really
work exp

565
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:29,970
experience in your part is you know how
do you

566
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,220
go about creating a good argument
without having to

567
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,900
I see cover all bases more surgical in
pushing policies

568
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,540
creating that real descriptive
illustrated

569
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,540
argued to your you know copperheads
explains this is

570
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,700
re: said less is or is it was the RO

571
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,400
which is sometimes difficult security
actually more countermeasure

572
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,970
be proactive %um which is what really
need sometimes 5

573
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:03,100
yeah yeah that's probably the hardest
thing that you have to ever do is 90

574
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:03,670
percent

575
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:07,500
is talk to you high-level its people
because I am

576
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,660
yet they have a completely different set
of priorities priorities are all higher

577
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:15,310
profit hands where the revenues coming
from work going

578
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:20,399
I think won the best tools for
convincing

579
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,090
businesspeople they need to spend money
on security is fear they have to be

580
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,940
afraid

581
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,780
of their information Boston have to be
made aware of how valuable

582
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:32,010
actually is the sentiment data is the
most important thing

583
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:35,440
company has if i've a warehouse for a
Tory I can

584
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,990
have insurance on man if somebody no
burns's for

585
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,060
steals it it's gone but I'm gonna get
most my money back sentiments were in

586
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:47,220
be able to recover from data once it's
gone you can replace it

587
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,630
you know and we as a people it. know how
sensitive that really is and how

588
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,350
easy it is for that it actually be lost

589
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,050
by as far as communicating those things
like I said fear

590
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:04,430
is is a big motivator for those
companies showing them some stats might

591
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,850
be helpful I don't know if you've seen
the FBI

592
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,600
I'm CSI survey on information security
it's a great resource

593
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,770
option every year and they do a survey
of companies across different industries

594
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,940
and give some numbers about how
expensive it is for the average company

595
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,110
to clean up after data breach

596
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,120
what companies are doing how many of
them using corruption I mean the Muse

597
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,170
antivirus when

598
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,230
firewalls and stuff to be serving
d'ivoire

599
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,000
what other people are doing and Beckham
a big motivator for companies to

600
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,630
to see to business person like in your
industry people are doing these things

601
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,870
policy is right up there like you're
saying Tom

602
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,190
no sending these policies in force in
mom is right up there maybe some stats

603
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,680
like that

604
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,960
how now Mike I think it can I'm culture

605
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,810
as you said culture major discrepancy
value that stuff

606
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,940
fine is a definitely think he comes into
a numbers game yeah

607
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,850
not just have to bless them absolutely
and everybody's fighting for their

608
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,680
budget you know

609
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,570
especially a large organization sounds
like you're working on and eighty

610
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,629
YouTube harmonies is fighting for its
budget on the other departments are

611
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,210
fighting for their budget is really just
a scramble to see you

612
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,210
most money on the big leagues right so

613
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,570
what you need to do is is simply a years
come from and say look

614
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:16,890
this is a real problem here are the
facts here numbers about this

615
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,379
sure the companies like ours maybe find
some companies and in your industry

616
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:25,030
that have had problems with this here's
what it costs them to clean this up

617
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,350
here's what it would have cost them to
prevent and there are some good stories

618
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,159
to mention study just in June

619
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,179
by Gartner comparison have cost between
cleaning up in

620
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,770
and preventing a brief so I think those
stats enough numbers for the

621
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,929
gonna be the best way for you to
communicate from does the is also cover

622
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,710
I guess

623
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,340
diesel a wide range policies and
standards that

624
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,520
to be applied organizations such as
socks

625
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,790
way you know sup a company will be
audited right

626
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,110
others do I get good stats on complete a
screw-up

627
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,360
when they get audited where I could find
out you know

628
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,700
what exactly happened to them I'm not
aware of any place for their stats on

629
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,630
specifically

630
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,820
on its like that by the government
because Sox pretty nu

631
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,930
and you know obviously that's what
legislation is pretty nu I'm

632
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,190
companies are getting hammered pretty
havel by

633
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,830
me I system this corporate scandals and
gone and accounting serve

634
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,560
force that and a lot of public relations
issues like I'm

635
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,860
you know much choice point guard systems
lot companies like

636
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,810
I don't know of any place we can get
stats specifically I'm effective

637
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,270
policies are different

638
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,630
legislative issues that have cause pain
for companies

639
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,070
unfortunately by Tom if you come across
in a move to

640
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:42,070
take a look at it thank you very much

641
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:49,650
appear

642
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,540
okay yep that's okay all-star on you
talked about implementing strong

643
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,590
policies for emailing data access

644
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:02,910
I'm is there a place we can find
templates so that you don't have to like

645
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,569
try to start from scratch think I've
everything that somebody else already

646
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,520
may have sort of thing yes yeah on a
problem vietnam

647
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,650
for best place I've seen to get sleep on
their lot of web sites were

648
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,550
that have these policies of sands is a
good place to start I'm ass

649
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,530
he an ass not work and

650
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,810
that is organization training you have

651
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:28,670
some owners of the country all year long
different security issues they have

652
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,480
security certification to give away G
Sakshi actor

653
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,850
lot of are programs that they do when
they have on their website they have a

654
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,930
a section of white papers and have a
section on

655
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,029
with policy templates wanted a tax
policy should look like greenup Ocelot

656
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,050
stuff it's very good

657
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:47,980
for information yeah I should help you
gun

658
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,590
my company is a is pretty good sized

659
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:56,780
which is higher percent awareness ok

660
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,800
are September probably around fifty

661
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,450
what what alternative are available for
companies that are small

662
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,730
medium-size they can't really afford to
hire a person full-time

663
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,040
where's programs that they can take

664
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,960
job for this person was on staff

665
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,330
sorely oxley idea was to someone

666
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,569
yes was thing

667
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,850
ideas on yeah that's a tricky one
because

668
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,930
I was a small businesses have a lot less
of your resources and

669
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:33,950
have the same kind the budgets and down
prioritize the same things in a big

670
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,210
company would prioritize

671
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,610
so you see a lot of times you see they
don't wanna bring in consultants because

672
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,680
it's very expensive

673
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,910
obviously they don't have the money
full-time people this very small

674
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,990
organizations money full time IT people

675
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,830
much class training training seminars
for the employees are confined

676
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:53,150
Messina can say about that know if any
nationwide resources that are available

677
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,310
for

678
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,370
that sort of training like I said there
are specifics technical security

679
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,049
training seminars are given by

680
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,150
organizations like sands by you can

681
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,960
you can bring somebody in to do some
training on a on a regular basis and it

682
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,490
doesn't have to be that expensive

683
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:11,320
but again nationwide I'm not aware of
any sort of programs that exist

684
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:15,070
bite or software or anything like that
our box and

685
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,150
and those sorts of things and guides
templates that are available online for

686
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:19,470
some

687
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,180
so the data policies but unfortunately I
don't know anything besides bringing a

688
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,629
console

689
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,010
just work with employees every six
months or every nine months or 12 corner

690
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,700
whatever is for smaller organizations to
you to really have that same level of

691
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,570
awareness is a big organization but the
advantage small organizations you fewer

692
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,880
employees so you're training

693
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,030
cost should be pretty low you know
you're really just talking about a

694
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,010
couple hours

695
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:44,220
its I'm we split training sessions
obviously

696
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,670
I'm doing our two at a time don't do it
whole day

697
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,100
because P we all know people's own it's
not you know it's it's not conducive to

698
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,420
them

699
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,750
really picking up as much information as
I could so you know do it over the

700
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,590
scores have a couple weeks and do it do
it for a few afternoons

701
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,720
at a time that works in smartrend's
Asian even better

702
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,450
work large organizations give all your
employees string some racquets nothing's

703
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:06,500
going down so

704
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,370
you can split up a smaller group and and
do it that way with somebody

705
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:13,569
we bring in from the outside if its
commuter pass by so

706
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:20,570
sorry that doesn't really answer your
question yeah

707
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,510
it seems like

708
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:38,020
when you talk to I guess upper upper
management

709
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,410
and you mentioned the word security
automatically think I T

710
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,578
which is why it's hard to you get the
funding him

711
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:49,400
get the money to create programs I guess

712
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,040
through your consulting work have you
found a better way to communicate

713
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,150
upper management debt securities just
not in nineteen issue it's not

714
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,119
station documents and social engineering
physical security

715
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,960
so have you talked to like companies to
say you note this is a corporate

716
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,040
this is not just I T right want the best
things then

717
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,279
for to do especially large organization
for the sky consulting

718
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,890
is to to go into organizations work you
have a certain level

719
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,950
of confidence in your IT security

720
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,700
certain of conference room antivirus or
firewall second thing simple fantastic

721
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,950
stuff can can you know see if that
actually effective by

722
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:32,760
going to an organization using its own
does specializes in social engineering

723
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,010
for instance and saying look

724
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,730
we can get this information hacking in
your system's we can

725
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,500
we we dive we went into your trash into
the social security numbers

726
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,930
we found copies emails between high
level execs in your trash we

727
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,649
walk to your office and collected 10
passwords are in

728
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:54,700
sticky notes on monitors or something
those kinda demonstrations are

729
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,819
incredibly powerful

730
00:40:55,819 --> 00:41:00,020
because that really makes CEO step back
and say

731
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,869
you know while you didn't have to access
our data systems and you've got all this

732
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:04,650
information

733
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:08,319
imagine if somebody actually hacked the
system know what word

734
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,819
look like so again fears a big motivator
and demonstrating to accompany

735
00:41:12,819 --> 00:41:16,589
those things can be done is very
powerful so that would be the best thing

736
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:17,170
you can do

737
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,760
how can you do that without getting
thrown in jail

738
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,579
well you have is you yet love these
people that

739
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:27,690
that even can show weakness they

740
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,060
we come down on her like like like what
happened

741
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,250
at the New York Times article in other

742
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,319
other companies that the show them the
flaw and

743
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,680
they wind up in jail and how can you
convince the upper management at the

744
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,230
company

745
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:47,380
that IT security needs to have more
funding directed toward

746
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,890
because most to the problems I encounter
is

747
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,040
well anything can happen to me right and

748
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,150
that kinda thing right goes big
mentality I think my regard

749
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:02,450
to sing well you know big companies
sensitive credit card numbers in our

750
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,329
most vulnerable

751
00:42:03,329 --> 00:42:06,130
you know they're gonna be companies that
are targeting our company nobody would

752
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,220
care what we have

753
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,369
pheno Spurs information goes but Tom
without getting thrown in jail

754
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:15,329
yeah that some the best thing I think
you can do you

755
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:18,920
if your purchase company to consulting
working internally in a company

756
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,150
it's a different story if you're
approaching a company I see don't want

757
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,660
it to you

758
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:26,750
is it would appear consultant to
accompany

759
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,690
I mean what you doing something security
like doing a program for them

760
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:34,690
like a this is especially true for in
hollywood crime down in hollywood

761
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,950
buddy media companies in and movie
companies analysts

762
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,500
TV companies something these have no
concept security right well the the best

763
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,180
thing to do was approached him with the
confidentiality statement that's usually

764
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:45,819
what I do

765
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:49,130
person confidentiality statement say
here are you know

766
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:53,040
I'd like to take a deeper look into this
here is a statement that says

767
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,190
whatever information I find is can be
kept confidential and you have to really

768
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,650
get the permission I think that's most
important and

769
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:01,670
how does one get permission from the
company like for instance if they

770
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,460
if they want me to do a pen testing for
instance he scares me because

771
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,569
somebody in the company has authorizes
Pentax

772
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:11,619
and isn't it is there you have to go
through some type legal

773
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:15,940
what is the legal requirements went to a
company to get authorization for pen

774
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,130
testing in the conditions

775
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,829
I that they might impose their and on
that because that's

776
00:43:20,829 --> 00:43:25,040
whether the big things that scare me
from penetration testing we're gonna

777
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,130
varies from state to state just want a
new legislation special Wireless neck

778
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,750
cases me no sane people getting thrown
in jail for world

779
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,270
fantastic thanks with you if you
purchase company you get authorization

780
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,020
from a company

781
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:40,119
to do whatever you need to do to get if
their systems and you

782
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,970
are released from liability from that
company basically you have a release why

783
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:44,950
I believe that says

784
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,619
I'm not liable if I bring your system's
down you know if if we still this

785
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:49,470
information

786
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,819
we can we get access to it you're not
gonna press charges against us that's

787
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:53,240
really

788
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,609
the the only thing that you can do and
legally that covers you protease

789
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:00,670
free probably is there a boilerplate
agreement that one could get on the net

790
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,010
somewhere for this kind of stuff

791
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,410
I'm not sure if Sands has

792
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,160
something like that but I think you
should be able to find some kind of

793
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,180
standard agreement

794
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,200
but does that were otherwise talk to an
attorney shits

795
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,069
it's a you notice a page 1 documentation
peak notion be very expensive territory

796
00:44:17,069 --> 00:44:17,710
like a

797
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,240
work you get a time when it's time to
revise and explain to them what you're

798
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:21,810
doing

799
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,440
somebody who works in in software and
hardware specifically would be a good

800
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,240
resource

801
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,810
so but I'm not aware of any sites have
specific templates for and stuff

802
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,619
unfinished thank you very much okay
thank you

803
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:35,790
do you find it you find it's more
effective

804
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,849
to have outside companies consultant
come in

805
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:42,430
and do the penetration testing for
management to see that

806
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,690
this outside companies come in no
knowledge network and their

807
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,750
stood and this information or I mean
opposed to having internal IT saffir

808
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:50,280
internal

809
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:53,460
IIT security come in actually

810
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,180
do the penetration test and it's kinda
like all they know the network they know

811
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,520
this you know obviously we could squeeze
more out of it

812
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,869
it's good when your experiences would
have you found

813
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:06,910
as the more viable approach in if
internal 'it's

814
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:11,440
actually doing it and the auditing you
know how you present at two

815
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,760
people such a non-biased way right arm
while the were the big things with

816
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,260
working with external

817
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,440
its with an external consultants that
VAT company for the

818
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,470
the department there's there's a certain
level of threat that they feel from that

819
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:25,579
company because

820
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:28,950
I've I've in ninety per com and I've set
up the system

821
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:32,780
I configure my farm positive samples AB
stuff from havel's technology in place

822
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,049
to keep it secure

823
00:45:34,049 --> 00:45:38,380
and now somebody's gonna come in and try
to break that and so now my job I write

824
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,170
feel at least

825
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,859
my job is on the line and so for console
it's very difficult to go in and say

826
00:45:42,859 --> 00:45:43,369
look

827
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:46,839
talk to the atty want to work we're here
to make your job easier

828
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:50,960
not to you you make you look bad in
front of Management anything like that

829
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,869
so that's a big issue but in terms of
what companies like to see I think

830
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:58,420
it's important to have someone from the
outside come in and UN

831
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,930
not just because you see are able to
demonstrate lucky sad

832
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,848
from it can be done from the outside you
don't have to have inside information

833
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:10,740
to do it but also because the provider
perspective for the people inside the

834
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,970
company

835
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,810
in all the snow is persecuting
programming worked in the project

836
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:19,930
you know the more you're in in something
you're dealing with on a daily basis

837
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:22,960
the harder it is for you step back from
that and look at it with objective

838
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:23,990
perspective

839
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,010
so I think that sense it's very
important to have outside

840
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:30,310
an outside perspective to say do these
things that you may be having considered

841
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:30,720
an

842
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,109
these might be some rest you haven't
looked at and an actually do the fantasy

843
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:38,290
yup you know there were problems here so
I would recommend combination both just

844
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:39,089
because

845
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:42,859
to department should be prepared to work
with those consoles and say look here's

846
00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:44,040
what we've done

847
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:47,220
African after and kisses here's what
we've done and

848
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:51,160
here are the things you found and now
consultant can say

849
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,868
you know these are going to be the only
things is going to be the only things

850
00:46:55,869 --> 00:46:59,420
is if things were to look at focus on
the most work with few tracks of those

851
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:00,200
issues

852
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:05,630
so its thank you you welcome to have
time for one more question

853
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,819
ok gone

854
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:12,750
to allow time I T department is wasting
our time

855
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,030
in answering basic questions how do you

856
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:21,490
recommend solving those it's a good
question everything passersby comes from

857
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:25,560
arm yeah that is a good question

858
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,240
training is huge I mean I'm no I'm
repeating myself your lap

859
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,780
training is huge few if you want to you
reduce the number of support calls that

860
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:35,069
you can about him our

861
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:38,089
particular application so you have a
host an application Ron

862
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:41,980
in-house you want to reduce Park awesome
the best thing to do is a cynical

863
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,819
seminars are some employees were

864
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,819
maybe and start with a small group and
see how it goes

865
00:47:46,819 --> 00:47:50,549
by you know set up a summoner that cover
some of the issues that you can make a

866
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:51,940
list of all the calls he got

867
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,040
most frequent factually basically you
know

868
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,630
these are the things that we get asked
now people have trouble attaching things

869
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,549
an email have trouble you know they
don't understand the message is that

870
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,740
they're getting from their anti-virus
software

871
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:10,119
down York have from passers resetting
passwords on a daily basis I can define

872
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:13,640
I'm so maybe you need to just make a
list want those things are

873
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,160
you're seeing most frequently and months
and then

874
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,230
designs in training undersea these are
the issues we have to cover in a

875
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:24,119
in easy for me and give employees some
information maybe make some

876
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,460
so hammocks or something my cousin from
begins with out guidelines on

877
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,490
how to use a sec non-jews hands and its
just are complaining so that training on

878
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:34,460
a small scale and see how it goes cuz
you should see a reduction

879
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,490
in sparkles eager for those issues I
think that would be

880
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:40,650
fine thank you %um thank you very much
