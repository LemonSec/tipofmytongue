1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,460
monks can anyone hear me

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,480
soccer's can

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,160
Street XP and he's

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,090
free vices I pull for vices

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,369
with governmental reviews weapons

6
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:28,369
so differences my cousin

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,769
his posthumously promoted to a battalion
chief

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,690
he's on motion list and you know start
looking I've been information security

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,050
for thirty years and I so looking more
closely

10
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:48,420
we expect our comp I'll country to be
doing

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,280
and 100 came out

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,040
stalk will go to the electromagnetic
spectrum

13
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,010
how waves propagate millimeter
wavelength x-ray backscatter

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,800
they just it s with know me to waive are

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,890
testing the PATH trains

16
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,970
I have some other documents portfolio
projector

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,110
on the spill out on a metal detectors

18
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,640
note 6 you picture was typeof arm access
device

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,070
and I'm gonna show you that they can be
hacked

20
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,830
country false positives and my demo I'm
gonna demonstrate reinforced positives

21
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,570
and being able to let's say close on a
courthouse

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,650
or an airline terminal I went to the
front or in back to attacks when people

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,890
talk about radio frequency weapons
advice about front or back to

24
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,399
the dial service do the demo

25
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,159
about fog terrorist event I was a
survivor 1993 bombing World Trade Center

26
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,270
and other channels like to talk about
fog

27
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,298
war but I've seen this fall you need to
have a terrorist vent

28
00:01:56,299 --> 00:02:00,360
and seems to be pack the max amount to
vom

29
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,829
entropy people don't know what to do and
get wrong

30
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,040
misinformation to call young Swiss
psychiatrist

31
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,048
maybe this inside in some work he did
why the FBI never was able to

32
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:20,579
work on the fish they received about the
9/11 attackers

33
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:25,060
peak oil parking you he was a Jew
physicist

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,549
in the 1950s 2.3 peak oil

35
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:32,280
maybe the things going about now because
people

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,280
that terrorism was gonna get much more
intense next couple years

37
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,000
lesson we talk about working on
something

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,010
laptop radio frequency device basically

39
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,920
can I E personal electronic device

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,900
be converted create electromagnetic
interference on

41
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,989
airplane to bring anything down in other
words

42
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,050
make the bomb in the future to bring
down a commercial airplane

43
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,349
is actually electronic device so

44
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:04,950
the so-called much man expect from

45
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,530
one cycle to billing cycles per second

46
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,540
its electron wave

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,390
magnetic wave changing electronic wave

48
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,590
wave changing in time Chris magnetic way

49
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,840
magnetic waves change in time
pres.-elect wave microwaves

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,900
look dramatically waves which or have a

51
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,239
high-frequency the radio waves infrared
you know high-frequency

52
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:35,250
visible light high frequency and same
time it's free

53
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,299
increases the O wavelength decreases

54
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:42,360
ultraviolet sure soft x-rays again

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,810
high-frequency sure way like x-rays
gamma rays

56
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,670
how traumatic waves propagate

57
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,420
the reading in free space they could
actually conduction you can conduct

58
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:58,260
frequency waves to copper tubing copper
wire

59
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,829
and generally you talking about very low
re different ways in

60
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,810
100 2012 killers range induction
magnetic component

61
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,030
magnetic coupling he created magnetic
way

62
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,260
if cannot reduce electric current in a
while

63
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,750
magnetic coupling x3 backs

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,329
moving away and they said that they

65
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:28,329
and just

66
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,370
they just tested in the trains a
middleweight backscatter

67
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,830
and um what it does

68
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,960
sees you who you closing now

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,710
lakshmanan waves know %um produce them
your body actually

70
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,280
them mostly in the infrared and very
sure

71
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,699
very very sure microwave wave category

72
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,520
I'll this way if besides vice can be the
passive

73
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,909
active XD radiate moving to waive

74
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:09,160
radiation and directed at you ok pick up
to radiation from your body

75
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,330
on when it picks up that radiates from
your body was irradiated

76
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,169
or few irradiated with as I said it's
intrusive

77
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,210
you can pick up with the night you have
a team asked me beg

78
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,320
of you have a if your woman who had a
press removing your breasts the cease

79
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,469
anything underneath your clothes

80
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,910
I actually would suppose news just pick
up they have a contraband

81
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,740
with you wearing arm handgun screening
your clothing

82
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,599
winsome suicide bomb vest something of
that nature

83
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:45,690
arm can't be to feed

84
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,099
know the words can is this some type of
defense against us

85
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:56,099
and actually there is

86
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,400
to

87
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,850
I've to fabrics here and both these
fabrics actually

88
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,430
both absorb and reflect which bank
irradiation this one

89
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,580
is very fives or reflector and this one
reacts remember exactly and at the end

90
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,900
talk if you want come up believable
these fabrics if you feel the texture

91
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,780
and these fabrics that people use away a
put in clothing

92
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,180
mainly because the great amount little
manic electromagnetic pollution

93
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,050
wife all I to everything else it's just
see Lexmark pollution

94
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:38,240
and people keep it far away from the
body is possible this fabric

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,270
doesn't shield as much more pliable

96
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,370
too well Creek loading out of this
fabric

97
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,170
react no have a

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:54,120
Garrett and I'm sure you've seen these
in airports

99
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,150
and if I bring bike

100
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,460
so reacted pretty readily

101
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,930
this fabric while

102
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,620
yugos field text fab in other countries

103
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,450
is more Ave concern

104
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,840
about much man pollution than there is
in United States

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,630
special low-level magnetic fields and

106
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:27,760
these fab but you can buy are I don't
have commercial interest in it have my

107
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,120
email address

108
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,250
in the session if you send me a little
blurb house a new way to find the

109
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,960
fabrics

110
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,630
so that's what backs and this will take
you

111
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,450
back x-ray backscatter which is very
very soft x-ray to

112
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,340
that will be reflected in of this and as
I said

113
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,540
this type of device is very intrusive
arm

114
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,510
I'm gonna get some with a contusion or
how

115
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,360
home in security wants to implement this
right now they're just doing testing

116
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,080
arm I don't think they know there any
countermeasures I don't think they care

117
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,960
and Dom I don't think they do a lot in
terms testing security

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,210
the test two devices but the test them
in the most

119
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,580
favorable arm environment on the books
fable circumstance

120
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:19,270
metal sectors

121
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,340
they really came into their own during
world war 2

122
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,660
sector land mines

123
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,110
and used to sweep areas where land mines
or

124
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,700
the used even today for that purpose arm

125
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,910
you can call to the airport most
buildings day without going to models

126
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,400
actors

127
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,929
they have the will to variety they have
the handover Audie

128
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,520
arm but no te quedas do least

129
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,670
not the treasure hunting melt actors or
the middle shooting

130
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,229
the corn should but the security motors
one thing they do the self-tuning

131
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,770
selves usually in a very hostile
electromagnetic

132
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,300
environment that means that there's a
lot electrical equipment going on

133
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,590
maybe x-ray machines are

134
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,310
microwaves other things which they could
pick up and they could go off on so we

135
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,180
have to be able to self to themselves

136
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,780
some metal sector security Milt actors
don't

137
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,910
self tune some with them they like you
manually tune them

138
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,540
and that's session that would have
organizations buying them

139
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,199
with another self tune or manual tuning

140
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,550
arm one min signals always another man's

141
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,130
which amended pollution arm

142
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,210
two metal detectors early walkthrough
variety

143
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,960
if things close proximity they transmit

144
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,060
signal generally under 100

145
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,330
kilohertz as a hundred thou hundreds

146
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,550
thousand cycles someone got 200

147
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,130
alerts if you have two machines the same
machine

148
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,870
which has been same frequency they'll
probably future

149
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,510
some these machines they have the
digital signal processor in them

150
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,640
they can frequency top in change
frequencies so they don't interfere with

151
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,760
each other some of them

152
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,069
frequency hopped and also can self to

153
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,420
themselves with different frequency and
again as well how smart they are

154
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,449
usually airport you probably see the
walkthrough variety

155
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:23,310
arm number feet apart

156
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,990
so they don't interfere the two modes

157
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:30,510
OVA operation like this is

158
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,770
the motion mold and the point mode the
point to mold

159
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,569
means that it doesn't have to be

160
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:45,130
emotions in check the motional

161
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,590
means that it has to be SB onto

162
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,990
ask

163
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,280
she that

164
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,260
most the mail sectors are you can come
security will be the motion mode once

165
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,689
they won't be the point Ahmad wants I'll
point them old ones and

166
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:09,320
if you want to do the demonstration
later on you can actually shield

167
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:15,300
things easily from point to move on

168
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,610
okay work work you do

169
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,030
to defend against most actors you can
shield absorb the MF

170
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,050
field create false negative

171
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,170
increasing in background which minute
field

172
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,900
increase electromagnetic pollution which
basically

173
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,270
one's self tuning ones that come lessons

174
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,920
the duty to themselves tree falls
positive you can broke ass and three was

175
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,719
attacked

176
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,780
free false positives and false-positive

177
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:52,780
basically is a denial of service attack

178
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:57,090
with %uh much merit devices

179
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,360
weapons this number different attacks
you can do a frontal attack

180
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,960
back to attack and if you do any search
is a real frequency weapons

181
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,780
I'll talk about this is actually third
coupling method to

182
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,890
are which is actually coupling for the
electric grid

183
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,900
in other words if you compromise which
grid you inject a real frequency signal

184
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,040
right into the grid

185
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,189
you be able to mom create interference
for that device sometime interference

186
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,690
arm front to attack is really something
of an urban terrorists

187
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,750
it's more surgical because you're to in
front to attack to the antenna system

188
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:37,930
and you coupling through whatever
frequency that machine is working at

189
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,830
so it's more surgical it's more
psychological

190
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,400
give you much greater control ability

191
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,570
and also treats helps increase the bit
error rate

192
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,590
which basically is if you have a device

193
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,780
that

194
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,569
just got up very dry now of the other
device

195
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:05,630
that is up from to function

196
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,800
with internal signal now you inject
radio frequency

197
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,430
signal near the frequency that signal

198
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,060
it's also process seen that signal but
that is actually a narrow

199
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,110
so increase the bid to rate 20 percent

200
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,940
it's actually processing your signal
another signal that should be processing

201
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:30,940
if you do that both with analog

202
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,710
you can do that both analog chips and
digital chips

203
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,600
flannel of chips the best way to couple

204
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,180
are you real from synergy is he the
credence on wave

205
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,480
well maybe so too way with digital chips

206
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,910
obviously polls will square wave

207
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,020
but again are depend upon touch if you
wanna go after

208
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,780
and most devices they contain both
analog and digital chips

209
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,839
arm and the penny on which ship is close
to the

210
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,830
front towards the antenna that maybe you
way the one couple with that device

211
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:18,270
next couple next way back to and the
back to is basically creating

212
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,069
a very L'Auberge wideband

213
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,080
signal short duration

214
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,000
and really haven't in polls in the make
range

215
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,400
that is really something that is more
left the army or the Air Force

216
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,190
because if you try to do it which may
not be able to but even if you get close

217
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,610
you block yourself that happen

218
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,180
fact that I'm using back to a that space

219
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:50,530
shocking effect you affecting everything
you may affect your own equipment to

220
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,630
seem a burn your own are very very high
power

221
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:59,079
arm hi infrared signature

222
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:03,530
means things somethings really hot are
you good delivery system

223
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,610
if you high-energy filming that polls
cost you

224
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,070
say 10,000 miles to build you need a
delivery system

225
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,940
is least million dollars you can better
make sure them with that goes off

226
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,770
this fall fall fall away from you it's
not

227
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,530
really something that's workable for

228
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,100
damages create even a terrorist Craig if
you have a limited budget

229
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,200
the third method couplings such a great
electric power system

230
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,810
such houses and could be the local
building

231
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,980
injecting signals right into the lead to
greater the logo

232
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,459
building it could be a bus which I one
but two

233
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,570
onto the bus between airplane again oMG

234
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,079
took talk about later on building an
electron device

235
00:15:51,079 --> 00:15:54,610
which couples to little sister were
pardoned shipping

236
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,620
such that income the bomb in the future
se duniya play

237
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,200
wheelbase Liam try to do
proof-of-concept whether not

238
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,680
terrorist somebody else can do that but
again coupling to the electric grid

239
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,850
is probably the best way because you're
following most entry

240
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,000
directly to that device and again if you
do any research on

241
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,530
we offer to weapons and the government

242
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:20,839
this is a booklet talk about this war

243
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,970
that the government puts out for threat
to you for two weapons

244
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,970
they talk about these weapons think the
future

245
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,839
they have to plan for them are thats

246
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,600
hits a day or maybe with the next 5-10
years

247
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,120
the cup talk about just two coupling
methods but really three couplings

248
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,890
story another more interesting

249
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,770
okay how keen to then I'll service
attack

250
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:55,260
with greater frequency devices well use
technical modulation which basically

251
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,800
your signal is mixing with

252
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,839
the signal that the device is supposed
to be receiving overload from the

253
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,110
receiver device

254
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,800
that was put so much for you for CNG
that it's just

255
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,020
overflown front and screen a problem arm

256
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,290
today we have more real time

257
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,879
processing using radio frequency links

258
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,030
than ever before this can only increase
next 5-10 years

259
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,199
arm and it would be easy

260
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,880
again the protocols at the twenty used
for these

261
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,490
for PC devices to transmit information
arm

262
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,920
they try to do checks arms and other
authentication

263
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,100
but again to dial serves is relatively
easy

264
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:47,100
especially for something terrorist
situation them all time

265
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,260
what I have here is

266
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,050
it's actually will generate a from ramzi

267
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,290
electronics it's really ordeal and

268
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,010
radio frequency 02 five megahertz

269
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,180
and on have Garrett's

270
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,370
one and Garrett this

271
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:17,180
is probably the best belltech out there
played with a test

272
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,380
and I think see you pictures overall
airports in everything

273
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,710
and it is the best it's its design
situated

274
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:33,710
docket 50 with is

275
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,890
best Garrett advertises that

276
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:46,260
Middlesex run at

277
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,430
95 killer hurts actually number them I
tested and they run a number of

278
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,350
different frequencies

279
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,190
in the 95 alerts range this one runs at
ninety 4.1

280
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:03,190
now

281
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,370
now when the stream to generate a 94
alerts

282
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,690
this is

283
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,049
10 and

284
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:23,049
just for this Garrett I don't have I
have actually

285
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:31,630
work

286
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:41,490
and how to kill her we're work

287
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,210
high-power output 40 let's say

288
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:53,210
basic

289
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,360
sure

290
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,350
some of them

291
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:21,350
while way

292
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:32,350
from the sky

293
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,330
most you can find audio amp

294
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,929
flies actually work up

295
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,890
for haha I the 20 kilohertz which is the
highest levels

296
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,020
I'll frequency which most people you

297
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,920
I can hear that I okay

298
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,500
this device work just as I demonstration

299
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,900
but a is a scaleable how easily is a
scalable

300
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,080
and scale have a

301
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,820
kid it's hard to kill words

302
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,679
frequency generator and also generates

303
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,350
polls so too

304
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,350
waves sine waves square waves

305
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:39,890
and this run 12's this

306
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,720
what amplified and this will help for I

307
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,500
this signal high enough that

308
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,820
you could base gold can stay conference
room again

309
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,429
or courthouse whatever one pro and this
is backpack

310
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:01,110
having a backpack the problem is that

311
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:04,460
you need a lot of batteries and yeah

312
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,900
really to supply this you really need

313
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,460
at least 10 if these

314
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,950
23

315
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,800
10 individual packs yeah

316
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,490
10 packs is

317
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:29,990
about 16 pounds like this is about 4
ounces

318
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,180
forums one thing

319
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,370
that they don't tell you will tell you
if

320
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,360
roof weapons with devices whether to

321
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,960
infrastructure is that tens if its
portable

322
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,120
have a battery problem pretty quickly
you know the problem a pretty quickly

323
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,110
he problem if I'm putting out a hundred

324
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:55,280
this these are actually high plains

325
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,760
because this cooks pretty fast

326
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,820
is actually ace

327
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,250
the arm

328
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,750
heatsink that goes with this but I
thought this is heatsink

329
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:13,490
these outrageous Cup claims this course

330
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,890
twenty-five dollars any building this

331
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:21,880
for the same

332
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,030
I can actually just to go to megahertz
it's just that the weights widening

333
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,379
on two killers arm and

334
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,510
everything he just puts individual chip
function generator everything else

335
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,590
insular my sis this is 35 miles

336
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,580
so 35,000 twenty-five dollars sixty
dollars

337
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,730
forty dollars batteries

338
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,770
you want good don't want these no-name

339
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:50,810
bring batteries and I use you want knock
on

340
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:56,210
are very good if you wanna lingering how
forty also four hundred dollars

341
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,860
you basically have a device now serves

342
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,050
against courthouse

343
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,240
and Dom again close on small

344
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,810
long-term arm again the government does
not worry about it

345
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,690
think about this i'd Homeland Security
has any

346
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,820
notion that something like this can be
done

347
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,500
some successful attack can be done thing

348
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,650
is that amusing loop

349
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:34,650
as an antenna Springs says

350
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,820
like high-speed to get into the
frequency style

351
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:48,899
this

352
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,720
is directional direction him people

353
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,720
in the audience but this is the No so in
other words discussed

354
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,929
actual property that its pic sheen

355
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,960
want and other frequencies actually

356
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,490
something else I can do and I've done it
a couple times but not

357
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,240
with great success it's not 100 sense

358
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,690
week

359
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:26,670
school as I can make a laptop itself I
can't destroy the data

360
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:30,670
that's the droid roads which some people
on the internet

361
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:33,750
say that weekend devised do that

362
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,800
i cant do I can make it re

363
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,380
self sometimes cash again hard

364
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,020
still there you doing well but uses
against

365
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:53,020
so

366
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:01,210
that was for them or something else I
survived 1993 bomb

367
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,000
site as for the 1993 bombing at the
world trade center

368
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,910
I was 17 the floor to world trade and um

369
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,610
I was very scared I don't know if you
had

370
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,370
too many people who have first party
type nationwide 10 know what happened

371
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:20,680
but

372
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,430
arm which fell to jobs in the building

373
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,550
and then we heard the sound sound takes

374
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:32,610
fine art on lebanon feet per second some
way to time

375
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:36,740
regis and we had no idea what it was

376
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,630
what happen is lights were now

377
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,450
very quickly and all the sudden

378
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,850
sunny so filled with smoke and Dom

379
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,280
an autistic son and you know that I was
just thinking about him because

380
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,970
you know I thought I was gonna die what
happened in buildings

381
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,050
om the events leading shares

382
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:04,070
for the elevators and the stairwells

383
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,500
I suppose possibly pressurized smoke
doesn't fill

384
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,850
I'm and all the power went out whole
infrastructure

385
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:15,010
now now in the arm will traits and they
have something nosy

386
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:19,490
emergency notification system people
source com allows because tell you what

387
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,090
to do

388
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:29,470
com that's just was taken now the smoke
start again so heavy

389
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,450
that first 15 people died from smoke
inhalation

390
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,060
noble wifi but small cut so heavy that

391
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:40,770
you just feel the grid in your mouth and
gritting your teeth

392
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,470
and a couple people try to break out
windows and a good break up one of these

393
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,880
windows a very difficult breakup it's
like 90 pounds pencil tables at once and

394
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,770
it bounced off

395
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,930
and it wasn't are

396
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:58,940
until maybe over talent with that in the
smoker's in Dhaka

397
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,610
are it seem like we could even try to go
down

398
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:07,080
the fire escape the stairways other
phones that work

399
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,530
we got just very very next

400
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,980
on information about what to do should
be evacuate not evacuate because

401
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,530
you know that smokes kenneth was there
was you know flies on the forty floor

402
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:23,570
if successful sandifer you know with the
fire is you don't know what's happening

403
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:27,750
maybe gonna be piled into lumber people
wanna low-floor

404
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,180
and burned to death finally

405
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,300
and maybe that ninety minutes later
smoke seem to be coming from the

406
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,630
stairwells not seem to be as thick much
fuss

407
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,690
piled up and at that time

408
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,400
screen um I did mainframe security still
to me from security the security

409
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,080
and a set a laptop was pretty mainframe
ID's

410
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,770
gonna be merged he signed authentic my
me my laptop

411
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:58,900
and I joined session down walking down

412
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,910
those stairwells aw very narrow are
solely to play too

413
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,170
totaled of course we had absolute knows
idea what's going on

414
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:11,260
but again is the the fog at this event

415
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,640
what was going on if in the truck that
exploded

416
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,860
if some have a clutch sarin gas chlorine
gas

417
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:24,010
this went two floors are were killed us

418
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:27,550
now if you go to 9/11

419
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,250
something happened some number
interesting things about for quitters

420
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,480
event the first a building

421
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,390
number one world trade was hit and I
still friends in two world trade on

422
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:41,130
Sunday for

423
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,500
emergency when that building was hit
were one World Trade

424
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,180
the people to world trade wittoled just
a wee law

425
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,250
everything's over everything's fine just
keep working Dez

426
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,410
something incident world trade

427
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,770
and that was broadcast throughout the
whole number two world trade

428
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,360
friends mind that happens on the floor
one frontwoman

429
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,600
so abadi woman's body not

430
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,610
actually drop down but seem to float
down use of why

431
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,910
is like a week she couldn't believe it
and you start screaming

432
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:18,550
and almost automatic everybody their got
up just left

433
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,850
just everybody left I don't know what
happened

434
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,500
flaws you know arm there people there

435
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,090
mothers fathers wives

436
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:32,260
are you know that on here today because
I've

437
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,910
will instructions they receive their
about saying the billing don't go out

438
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,810
if I look at some other analogues to
tall building like the World Trade

439
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,750
Center

440
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,530
I can see the same thing in subway
system what happened bombings subway

441
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,139
systems

442
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,230
that if hypothetically

443
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:54,770
this guess attack and even our

444
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,460
emergency information is up her

445
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,800
predicated on that you can get first
responders the a

446
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,530
very quickly but as a guest attacking a
subway

447
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,020
what happens if somebody uses a very
different device to play with the

448
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,040
signals

449
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,389
all the doors trains where the
communication systems which very

450
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,830
vulnerable

451
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,990
its unhappiness a hundred potential
casualties on two people to the hospital

452
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,020
it being tens of thousands is the first
responders cake it to the people

453
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,400
people think it's first responders so

454
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,560
on the fog all the tears event is a very
real phenomenon I just haven't heard

455
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:36,429
anybody speak about it mention anything
about it

456
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:40,070
arm and stand in the bombing in london
the same problem

457
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:43,659
and their radios work in some way the
communication systems

458
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,930
and communication systems for more
experimentation

459
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,930
very very easy to take out it doesn't
take a lot of skill or knowledge

460
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,650
on

461
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,790
chaos chaos and not understanding what's
going on

462
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:05,790
not having full picture

463
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,420
this is is a funny slide are call young

464
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,850
never had a computer never knew anything
about radio frequency or anything else

465
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,870
and Republican thing about I doubt he
thought much about errors

466
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,070
wins call young bursts with psychiatrist

467
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:27,919
he arm develops theories personality
personality types

468
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,430
and Maya breaks there a mother-daughter

469
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,960
psychologist team and a dropped my
Briggs test

470
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,260
and they had did basically people take
this test the phone want

471
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,470
16 subtypes and was issues which usually

472
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,550
use for arm team building

473
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,570
corporations you realize that people
Ford 116

474
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,030
john 14 quadrants

475
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:56,540
and you think we perceive the world a
certain way

476
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:00,290
and when the uses for team building add
arm

477
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,470
corporations for people to go realized
the differences

478
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:09,110
and how people can perceive problems and
solutions differently

479
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,580
and optimally if you put people a
person's

480
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,750
take place from each squadrons the way
they think will perceive

481
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,610
put it together to solve a problem with
a fixed number of

482
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:26,520
arm resources they can performing get
the most

483
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:31,120
more optimized solution to that problem

484
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,020
if you look at something like the FBI
the FBI had number of

485
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,960
tipple said about 9/11 this female agent
who wrote about

486
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,750
om these people taking flying lessons
Middle East and send

487
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:47,100
number walk-ins they had a fish but 21st
hijack a

488
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,790
the agent who rices when first hijacked
he also thought there was more going on

489
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:55,110
and the FBI never picked up on it

490
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,910
they never picked up on any information
and CEO

491
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,350
say maybe the FBI needs to look at a
different model

492
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,030
I don't know if anybody Richard to
listen to a steal

493
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,399
and his conference's and

494
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,219
you know i think is 100 sent one the
money about that

495
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,440
now for something really

496
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,580
upsetting I sent away for the Spalding
radio frequency waves

497
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,699
and I read the

498
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:31,600
Bowl 10 and most it was kinda pace from
the internet

499
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,610
and

500
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,640
and I can you read that note we can't

501
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:44,639
okay which photo are ready for you when
I have an actual copy

502
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:28,079
shit

503
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,109
sorry about that

504
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:35,348
I'm giving it to look at the next
hackers on planet earth conference on

505
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:37,299
the topic and secure devices be hacked

506
00:35:37,299 --> 00:35:41,229
and make use a real fancy device to
feature you your organization might be

507
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:42,059
interested in attending

508
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:48,410
and this guy works for the government if
you want to get this ball 10 you go out

509
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:48,910
to

510
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,328
WWW dot he s WG

511
00:35:52,329 --> 00:35:55,869
dot gov is too technical school working
group

512
00:35:55,869 --> 00:35:59,079
which suppose local governments arm

513
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:06,079
fight against terrorism this is what I
got back

514
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:11,078
poor I'm not sure I could handle

515
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,920
repercussions attending little on
providing information that hackers find

516
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,430
useful

517
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:22,430
IMF to or from the public defense I

518
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,680
are from the conference I suspect my
boss would have a hard time explaining

519
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,910
that once was changed to man thanks but
I have to decline no i didnt I really

520
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,770
didn't set aside in set this guy up

521
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,180
I really did not expect this reaction I
really

522
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,069
and no may be a very naive was stupid
but a

523
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,100
I just was very surprised arm

524
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,450
I'm not sure that our country you know
people complain about

525
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,530
mother mission the national security
agency is trying to

526
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,990
gather and everything else and I'm sure
if they did get the right information

527
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,830
they be able to accurately on it

528
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:03,870
arm I know about what happened with the
FBI

529
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,020
and I was just totally blown away when I
got this

530
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,340
response about on

531
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,320
you have the originals again again said
the guy up and you know I even have

532
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,700
black males name I don't think it's not

533
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,960
that he/she we penalize anything like
that just it's more an issue of the arm

534
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,650
the psychology will love that

535
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:29,320
structure all that institution that they
haven't changed at all they don't know

536
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,960
how to change

537
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,960
well they don't know how to react
information one less

538
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:44,210
slide

539
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:50,700
to list lines sorry about that

540
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,630
people I don't know if anybody's ever
heard thing

541
00:37:53,630 --> 00:38:00,630
you but you can do a search ok

542
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:11,540
can you was a Jew physicist I think you
work for shell

543
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,590
and in the fifties who worked on
mathematical model

544
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,670
peak oil and basically

545
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,480
production and exploration boo start
declining

546
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,820
are he did frictions 56 te production

547
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,410
will people up to peak in the early
nineteen seventy that war world or will

548
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,460
peak in the year two thousand 2010

549
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,010
and arm the major

550
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,550
actor for all the major feel that we get
will from

551
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,840
is called the Garfield in Saudi Arabia
which is a monster field

552
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,750
boots is about 25 percent of the oil in
saudi arabia

553
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:52,240
and that is well over 50 years old which
means that it's ready for the decline

554
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,010
arm with peak oil

555
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:59,800
I don't think things can become safer in
the world I think that the mother

556
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,660
terrorism

557
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,069
terrorist activities gonna increase
dramatically including

558
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,310
in this country I like the guys at the
gotten

559
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:12,150
Miami I guess really wanna be's because
I don't think they

560
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:16,980
really could be a threat books you know
maybe I really don't know

561
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,070
but I think peak was gonna be a major
catalyst

562
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,750
maybe it's a callous now and our things
going to get much worse

563
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,619
but are you don't see any bright side to
this

564
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,109
now the final slide can you build

565
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:38,230
radio frequency devices working laptop
in other words

566
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:42,100
Kansas laptop be a device

567
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,220
try to vice that generates harmonics

568
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:52,170
frequencies double couple such a way to
an airplane jet airplane passenger plane

569
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,390
to bring it down for small

570
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:59,868
be undetectable because you know you
bring your laptop through the x-ray to

571
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:00,780
see if there's any

572
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,150
organic matter in its knows just circuit
switchboards which

573
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,130
that's in any laptop arm

574
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:11,330
it could be a very

575
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,880
smart want be very smart device

576
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,390
language program and wanna create square
waves at

577
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,940
1 gigahertz

578
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,640
working square way to 10 megahertz they
could be very dumb device that use turn

579
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,210
it on

580
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,030
it's not 3d and with surface mount
technology

581
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,850
and the space laptop its role to leave
easy to do today

582
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,279
and I think this is gonna be the first
time anybody has ever heard of this

583
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,310
type device a thought it may be the
staff advises me 5-10 years away

584
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,520
but I think it's doable now

585
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,320
I don't know if anybody if such a device
exists in the world well

586
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,670
impetus way if such as vice exist in the
world

587
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,510
the people who have it if they hear
about the stalk

588
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,450
would probably have to use a quickly so
you can quickly next couple weeks before

589
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:07,670
the TSA's try to develop some council
defenses against it but

590
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,600
knowing the way home and student essay
is I don't think

591
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,420
the convo been counted fences I don't
think they could

592
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,460
I think the FAA would be very concerned
about this

593
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,460
I don't think common security find it as
a threat to understand I'm sorry

594
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,390
okay

595
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:32,460
okay as far as I know I'm the I'm the
first person

596
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,010
had this type of idea actually do it are
airplanes on middle cavity

597
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,020
that means that the rate of in two ways:
bounce back and forth

598
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,900
Boeing not Airbus out a wide Boeing not
Airbus

599
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,090
and Airbus

600
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,270
seem to use of composites some other
composites

601
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:54,150
a column base date any weight to rate of
ways

602
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,500
so across mean why we seem to have the

603
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:01,570
more problem one Boeing as possible so I
have I've pic

604
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:04,960
it's not easy to take down airplanes
they the

605
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,230
FAA nasty done a fantastic job making
airlines

606
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,580
security safe it really is not easy

607
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,509
arm airplane crashes happen because out
sites to school vans

608
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,150
and basically what that means is drive
your car

609
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:25,050
run outta gas you get out of the car you
get hit by CAW

610
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,820
not the car that's a statistically call
it an event

611
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:32,010
sticks time drive a car

612
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,820
when it gets good at all get it by media
media has asked to speak or later event

613
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,940
so number outside events have happen

614
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,750
arm I gotta get a jumbo jet but at least
fifteen thousand cycles takeoff and

615
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,740
planes take off and lands

616
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,250
because I need cell cycle says more fre-
Nov

617
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,030
wiry amateur and in the plane actual
have to pick my plane

618
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:58,770
as carefully as I after the my laptop
and device

619
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:01,990
100 sensor need laptop repairs airport
security

620
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,970
this will go through security there's no
doubt in my mind is

621
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:09,720
is only 10 percent certainty that oppose
differently to magnetic

622
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,810
are radiation problem they're playing on

623
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,220
when I build the device I may not build
the best advice

624
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,960
only because twenties for demonstrations

625
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,359
and I think there is a way to bring down
airplanes

626
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:31,170
and bring in the chance up to 90 percent
ninety 90 98 percent

627
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:36,340
bud I think I'd be more comfortable just
building

628
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:43,030
device it's not as good yes

629
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:48,200
gut feeling got feel yes

630
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,750
when they try to reproduce
electromagnetic interference in

631
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,810
airplanes

632
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:55,920
if the plane has an event many times
it's hard to reproduce

633
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,609
many many times adding people to look
electromagnetic come

634
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:05,410
arm compatibility these things are
difficult to reproduce

635
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,450
so

636
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:11,190
you know I'm dealing with a lot of
things here and I have put a lot of

637
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,180
things into

638
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:16,060
basically database basically reverse
engineer everything nasa

639
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,970
has done about interference in the
airplane and I do that

640
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:25,690
any questions

641
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:30,320
a small technical question can you tell
us anything about sunspots and how

642
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,310
they possibly affect some this equipment
the other issue

643
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,740
and the bigger ones at the end of world
war two

644
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,260
when it think with the atomic bomb

645
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:45,480
after it first happened there is lots of
knowledge about it

646
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,609
in is discussed criticized in everything

647
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:51,890
but with in a year within a year

648
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:55,170
there's this enormous secrecy as if it
was

649
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,750
a secret not science we sorta faced with
exactly the same thing

650
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:05,100
today and in a far more dangerous kind
situation

651
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,490
because people pretend somehow that all
this

652
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:14,030
its secret some hard candy cap sticker

653
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:18,390
right now you know the lot secrets and
you don't know what the government is

654
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,759
is done was doing on I don't know

655
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,859
maybe the government is working on
something along lines what I've done I

656
00:45:24,859 --> 00:45:27,290
don't I really don't know

657
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,359
I know but this is our application of
technology this is not pure science

658
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:38,069
I'm not on pure science I'm doing
Applied Science

659
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,410
you mentioned that this laptop am

660
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,480
MF interference generator the you
propose

661
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,660
would pass an airline security check yes

662
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:52,370
what if the security require that you
that the laptops to the function

663
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:56,130
it will function will go on BB I'm so I
didn't

664
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,510
make it clear that's a working laptop
will go on it will be be be

665
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,220
and so that's where the first thing to
check for

666
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,070
am with the very small amount of free
space generally available in a notebook

667
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,600
how do you how do you propose to include
all the amplification and the antenna is

668
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,760
required to generate significant

669
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,210
EMF from a completely working up a
computer on my

670
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,810
I don't have them here but is surface
now to technology that's very very small

671
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:27,940
you religious so for instance mourns
more arm

672
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,440
are some laptops is a lot more room than
others

673
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,310
but there is room there arm I might put
in

674
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:38,540
separate battery pack they I'm not
really sure

675
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,130
a cat its doable it's doable weather
brings an airplane that's a question

676
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:49,310
but it is doable it's doable today thank
you

677
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,580
I don't know how relevant this is but do
you think it would be possible to have

678
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,810
on pieces %uh you may be led some
something that's going to %uh

679
00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:00,380
block X-rays for if you have a a
suitcase you're trying to bring it

680
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,690
through the

681
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,880
x-ray detector arm to stamp

682
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,400
I an image in it were actually something
arm

683
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,740
what looks like an innocuous you know
what everybody would have in their bag

684
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:12,850
and have this

685
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:16,609
in the lining are in the upper lining up
the bag so that

686
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:20,290
arm it blocks on the X-rays

687
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:24,370
in a way that would look normal and then
underneath

688
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:27,900
the stamp pieces lead let's say arm

689
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,130
that are you know look like you know
toothbrush or

690
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,500
maybe some laptop or something arm

691
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,630
you have maybe something that you want
to hide and that way

692
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:41,640
you can go through it looks innocuous
they don't see anything funny but in

693
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,029
reality you have something

694
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:46,490
mischievous companies when I saw this I

695
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,810
look at different security tractors and
different tried to drop

696
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,850
different scenarios reach them and
that's the exact same area that I

697
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:57,640
thought for x-ray basically you dopson
to create a matrix

698
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,810
I'll absorbing meadow

699
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:05,240
relations or metal and basically looks
like almost white noise

700
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,330
and I think you would be able to get in
very easily whether use

701
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:12,680
trying to but through okay do so I think
you're you i think on the right track

702
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,859
which probably means that other people
are trying to do but do you think would

703
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,609
be possible cuz I think if it

704
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:20,830
if what they would you know if it if
they saw something funny

705
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:24,180
on the screen she was like noise when
they saw scattered they could see

706
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:25,049
nothing

707
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,500
then they would open up the back and
look inside arm i'm talking about.

708
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:33,060
maybe like drawing what you would look
like if that was normal

709
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,870
things that a person going on vacation
would have in the bag stamp that design

710
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,380
out have led

711
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:41,460
and put it in so it looks like normal
stuff in the back

712
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,270
and then you have underneath nasty
things whatever

713
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:48,220
that's that's good a team that will then
what I thought because that looks even

714
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,609
better than some that small white noise

715
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:53,710
you got a better idea maybe next

716
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,040
time you try to do that for next hope
number six no problem 27

717
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:01,640
but that is a good idea and I doubt that
Homeland Security so the people have

718
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:02,460
thought about it

719
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:08,060
considered

720
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,359
okay a quick question you did not Airbus

721
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:15,920
almost impossible lanes or fly by wire
I'll that actually means wire of that

722
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:16,250
site

723
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:21,069
the fiber optic if it's actually wire
with might be more susceptible to attack

724
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:22,430
is that might pick up signals

725
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:26,029
Mike jammed the computers you right
cause issues you're right

726
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:29,430
arm but the bones all flavor why to now
it's just

727
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,560
yeah it's just that om the Airbus

728
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,120
am have to do give God instinct

729
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,870
about thing because another enemy close
their airplanes

730
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,279
are I'm going through they're not gonna
let me

731
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,390
maybe in the airport anymore I don't
know

732
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,379
I have no idea arm

733
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,830
your are I'm just saying that because
the composites

734
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,220
do tend to absorb move the radio
frequency energy

735
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,060
problem but I could try it would have us
to

736
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,120
I'm just trying to say which shipping to
him at the shop but since both them

737
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:05,650
gently

738
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,859
Flywire I think following as far as the

739
00:50:08,859 --> 00:50:12,819
equipment would actually go probably
sits on notebook battery is fairly high

740
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:13,339
power

741
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:16,660
your way if you use a super cap along
with that you making ha

742
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,940
very high level holtz's with Modelo
duration:

743
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,000
you wouldn't need high power or large
equipment because you wouldn't

744
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,589
high duty cycle overheat or anything
else they could be quite small

745
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:31,310
I think you could end up with easily
people only get 200 boss

746
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:34,920
in short pulses edible nope before I
forget that

747
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:38,230
what I did clues about 10 to 20 what's
are

748
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,609
power you could probably get a lot more
than that in short pulses yellow duty

749
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:42,109
cycle

750
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:45,220
dude by more damage yeah would block
better

751
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,250
and the battery and notebook is quite
capable doing this to be a current

752
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,280
reading the team I am so very powerful

753
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:53,530
look at those freakin batteries a power
those damn things

754
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:56,920
see trouble is they're not to let me
close to an airplane that's for sure

755
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,109
especially although I doubt that the

756
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:04,060
I really doubt that Homeland Security or
those other people have

757
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:07,799
stop me it is a scary thought months I
think it's quite doable

758
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:11,580
this week it is yep way too low a guess

759
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,790
I'm gonna work on it they told him stop

760
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:15,470
sorry about that
