1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,320
there in just a moment on a quick
announcement on

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,138
this was handed to me the SDF public
access UNIX system is giving away free

3
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:11,849
validated show accounts to hope 6
attendees

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:15,639
I A on say to telnet to

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:18,960
SDF dot Lone Star .org let's

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,350
SDF to Lone Star dot org and put hope 6

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,430
as the reference to get a free account
with web space

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,380
email applications and even go for space

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,558
there's also yes

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,309
I was reading one is in front on there's
also a talk on SD /f

11
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:40,370
on Sunday at one o'clock in room C om

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,010
if you have missed any of these our
discussions and panelists

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,769
because you've gone off to have beer or
others to things going on at once you

14
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,390
can always buy DVD's

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,870
wear the t-shirts are but since we're a
little bit behind

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,870
what's kicking off with fiber its
project in math

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,910
okay

18
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,950
want to thank everyone for coming I

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,510
need to quickly just do a couple the
sound checks just bear with me for 30

20
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:30,510
sec

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,140
yes

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,040
the

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,180
ok

24
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,230
okay what I'm gonna do is on a blue box
I'm gonna do something that

25
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:39,929
probably people have not seen in quite
some time home

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,010
I'm gonna do it so you can see it I'll
explain it

27
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,700
right afterwards do it because it'll
also give me a good opportunity to

28
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,700
to a live chat what I'm about to do

29
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,358
is use a whistle that %uh famously

30
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:08,189
was known as the Captain Crunch whistle
and actually is

31
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,769
scrunch in the audience other areas

32
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:18,769
as the story goes John use this very
wessel

33
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,400
to signal 2600 hurts and %ah

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,519
see strong space sickly trunks for those
not familiar in the audience

35
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,260
or the the cables that link up

36
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,608
telephone switches together and up back

37
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:40,959
prior to the digital age when

38
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,169
nowadays everything is packet-switched

39
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,400
uses digital signaling system up until
the very early nineties

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,060
here in New York at least everything was
still analog trunk lines linking

41
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,769
telephone switches together

42
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,849
actually used the frequency 2600 hurts

43
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,569
to signal the idle or use

44
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:07,930
century the availability trunkline and
what people could do

45
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:12,870
using electronics or even its way
whistle in mimicking this frequency

46
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,969
could essentially take control

47
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,889
love a truck line and along with the
proper

48
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,599
tones which are different from the
touchstones that you would use

49
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:26,060
home an actual different setup tones
which

50
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,849
incidentally were published in a
legendary

51
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,909
Bell System technical journal back in
the seventies

52
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:36,210
which ended up I believe it university
libraries

53
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,340
ride yeah and people embarked on
building an electronic device

54
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,659
to mimic the stones and the rest is
history

55
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,810
essentially a whole generation of people

56
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,849
this man to my right Cheshire

57
00:04:51,849 --> 00:04:55,120
I as well as Captain Crunch John in the
audience

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,289
our instrumental in exploring the
telephone network

59
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:05,409
purely by sound alone back in the
seventies and eighties

60
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:10,699
it was very interesting experience to be
able to program

61
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:14,779
the switching systems which by and large
were

62
00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:18,560
electromechanical by today's standards
they would look

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,889
robotic essentially they had very large
moving parts that were extremely noisy

64
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,510
and relays and electromechanical cross
bars in the switches

65
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,159
were essentially controlled by these
magical toms

66
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:38,010
which as I just said were leaked out via
the MIT library through the Bell System

67
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,740
tech journal that published them

68
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,029
obviously the bell system was not
intending on the general public finding

69
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,419
out what the stones were

70
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:49,260
what ensued was sort of a combination of

71
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,389
toll fraud on a grand scale I

72
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:56,990
as well as sort of a a whole telephone
counter-culture

73
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,060
that developed around people building
devices to make the stones

74
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,940
and without any further ado let me play
somebody stones or something me never

75
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,849
heard before

76
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:12,849
that's the

77
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,240
famous 2600 hurts arm the whistle of
course

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,180
can make 2600 hurts much louder he which

79
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,889
which is great because sometimes ever
really lousy connection and you need to

80
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,460
be heard by the remote switch

81
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,279
in order to seize the truck arm what I
will do right now and it might take more

82
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,259
than one attempts

83
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:38,650
is I'm now going to sees a trunk

84
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,620
and place a call to someone in the
audience

85
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,089
is this person in the audience right now
can you can t stand up introduces

86
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:53,329
he will be receiving the test go

87
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:58,479
after the test calls made and we briefly
conversed with David of I'm gonna

88
00:06:58,479 --> 00:06:59,370
explain

89
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,089
what just happened and what I did to
make this possible once again

90
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:09,849
because as I touched upon this type a
signaling is not used anymore except

91
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:10,940
maybe in the most

92
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,669
remote remotest locations where digital
switching is not yet been install

93
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,190
all there's also areas I'm aware of

94
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,200
where even though digital signaling is
in place

95
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,140
they are still using have sick because
they simply haven't modernized

96
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,640
themselves yet need to be compatible

97
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,849
with older switches that still
communicating

98
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,269
to my knowledge no one is using 2600
hurts

99
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:41,440
single frequency trouncing so I had to I
just had to recreate this inside

100
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,959
the conference so here we are we're
gonna have a demonstration

101
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,539
bearing in mind doesn't always work the
first time and in reality

102
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,060
didn't always work the first time either
so it's very realistic

103
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,659
ultimately the goal is we're gonna be
able to call David

104
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,240
using the MF tones and

105
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,099
after we briefly converse with David
unexplained what I just did and I'm

106
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:04,500
gonna explain the project

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:11,500
me this possible

108
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,330
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna call in
number which back in the old days

109
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,810
would have been a number that was at
least %uh

110
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,120
just be on your favorite local tandem of

111
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
explain what that means in a moment also
bearing in mind this is a complete

112
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,060
simulation

113
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:32,039
I'm calling real phone numbers that are
in the public telephone network

114
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,240
over Voice over IP this whole
simulations be possible

115
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,409
by modifications onto the asters PBS

116
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:46,409
the

117
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,540
I should mention I I think the belt
right up pulling an article

118
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,510
once it was released in once they
realize what problems it causes yeah I

119
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,280
think the damage was done by the time
they realized the

120
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:18,100
tones frequencies also keep in mind that
back in those days

121
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,990
order very expensive they didn't expect
that the home hobbyist the bill

122
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,100
kinda bustling is required to produce

123
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,700
phones %uh the purity required to get
network

124
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,080
network where does you know my blue box

125
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,870
which you see here on stage is
relatively small a reason for that

126
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,650
is I'm actually using and synthesizer
chip

127
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,209
you have to understand phone company
himself obviously didn't

128
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,160
bill these huge circuits and put them
into project cases

129
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,209
and to on them with little I Chris
screwdrivers

130
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,740
so mom back in back in the ladies I
discovered

131
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,570
ship actually synthesized here we go

132
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:07,350
was a weak supervision

133
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,860
welcome

134
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,330
was the answer supervision if you're not
going to attempt to seize

135
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,810
number the person you're calling he

136
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:27,810
we have now sees the trunk we're now
going to sick

137
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,230
we have the whole did not go through

138
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,510
this moment happened he and we got
dropped

139
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,630
this is actually the

140
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,280
the way that I actually programa trying
to work back in the old days would have

141
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,569
been referred to as a good

142
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:59,000
tandem because oftentimes you can remain
on the trunk

143
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,500
and after you were done speaking to
someone or keep all sing somewhere

144
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,180
you could actually sees it over again
and get another went back and I'll

145
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,200
fresh number without having to start all
over sometimes it works and sometimes

146
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:19,200
the whole call players p do it one more
time

147
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:36,990
welcome a ride message

148
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,639
hello David

149
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480
00 so the great thing about using voice
over IP

150
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,130
is a lot of the providers let you set
your caller ID do whatever you want

151
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,589
that could be the subject yet another
arm

152
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:26,800
so we just blocks to call to David there
should no longer be possible

153
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,270
how could it have been let's explain
what I

154
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,439
and how I got the site and everything

155
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,180
leading up to this point home back
around

156
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,580
the end the last year a website came to
my attention called

157
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,570
phone troops and phone trips a website
that was

158
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,899
put together by our gentleman who
traveled around the country

159
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,600
in the seventies with the reel to reel
tape deck

160
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,970
who was just fascinated by all the
different sounds that he heard

161
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,510
when he placed phone calls this didn't
have anything specifically to do with

162
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,360
blue boxing

163
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,050
but he was just amazed by all the clicks
and Kurt Johnson different rings in

164
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:13,279
and and things of that nature anyone to
record them collect them and basically

165
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,420
archive the amazing thing is that

166
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,370
thirty years later he still has all
these real to reel tapes

167
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,890
and he digitized all these recordings

168
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,529
turn them into mp3's on his website as i
understand

169
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,770
since I'm mention this in the brief
summary

170
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,839
my talk on the hope website the phone
chips website has been

171
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,010
overloaded with people downloading
trying to help

172
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,010
threes now the thing that's interesting

173
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,839
about this particular website is amongst
the many recordings

174
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,880
are some actual recordings of

175
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,450
a gentleman who referred to himself
simply as event or

176
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,790
obviously an alias cannot possibly be
Israel

177
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,360
but what he did was he took

178
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,750
reel to reel recordings he had made of
people actually

179
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,800
blue box himself and some friends is
back in the seventies

180
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,930
from the early eighties he took the reel
to reel tapes any

181
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:16,699
digitized really high-quality when this
came to my attention

182
00:14:16,699 --> 00:14:20,310
and I heard somebody actually
demonstrating blue boxing

183
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,990
in sort of a a radio show format

184
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:29,540
which was really entertaining to me he
was sorta he was describing what he was

185
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,370
doing that sort

186
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,100
interviewing himself talking on the tape
in the seventies

187
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,800
which was very interesting sorta like

188
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,870
time machines home

189
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,370
when I actually heard someone blue box
release and I got

190
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,880
would be really cool this

191
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,720
obviously really can't be done anymore
because the phone system doesn't doesn't

192
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,839
work that way anymore

193
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,279
some thinking to myself wow

194
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,529
how would it be possible if it could be
and will start its

195
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,709
and I didn't already playing with

196
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:11,130
asterisk PBX which for those

197
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:15,660
you may not be familiar is free PC
software maintain

198
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,170
scores people that's been under
development for several years

199
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,459
I have been using it for

200
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:26,680
my own fun at home it had

201
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,990
come to my attention reading through the
source code

202
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,220
that actually is capable not only

203
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:39,199
of producing after detecting them as
well I didn't know how well the said

204
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
test once I discovered that it was
actually

205
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,390
possible I intended to find out how well
the first thing I need to do

206
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:55,199
was just I need to figure out a way to
create a trunk

207
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,079
that existed in my living now

208
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:02,760
probably sounds a little weird but since

209
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,829
nobody else is really helping me with
this project at that early point what I

210
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:10,010
needed to do is figure out how can
asterisk

211
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,640
fooled into thinking that two end points
over trunk line were actually the same

212
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,420
system

213
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:20,360
and it was the computer well it also
turns out that there is a feature an

214
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,170
asterisk

215
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,720
allows t1 over Eastern

216
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,949
which is extremely interesting what it
did was

217
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:31,209
I set up to extra Ethernet cords my
machine

218
00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:34,829
which incidentally right now is sitting
in the server room downstairs

219
00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:37,910
which we're actually connecting to with
us of all

220
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,180
and boxing through now what I did was

221
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,060
I created the trunk line essentially
this

222
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,350
st1 going over

223
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,939
you know it's the one with with voice
channel 24 channel Channel

224
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:57,010
with two sides so we have four th store

225
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,880
going over Eastern with the crossover
cable

226
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,490
anyone in the audience you may be
familiar shall

227
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,609
channel bank basically works where even
if you're not sending anything in your

228
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,339
particular time slot where's

229
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:13,829
there's no audio to San you're still
sending some

230
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,849
so if you actually word do this over the
same Ethernet

231
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:21,510
going over your your network would kill

232
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:25,560
because the bandwidth utilization we
just saw I found that out after taking

233
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,649
out my home network several times

234
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:33,590
so it was very clear to me that I needed
to dedicated Ethernet cords to serve as

235
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,080
the two

236
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,970
and points for the truck and connect
them up together over crossover

237
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,990
so great now I brought this up in
astor's

238
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,659
now the next thing I needed to do was
rather than using

239
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:49,720
you know modern signaling what I want to
do

240
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,800
is having use basically set up to use

241
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,330
as a digital channel bank but do analog
signaling

242
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,899
overdid again something that asterisk
should be capable of doing

243
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,330
based on the code that I saw it was ok
and

244
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,220
sure enough using unum signaling

245
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,140
bit sick over digital it was able to
signal

246
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,820
Emmaus which I was able to confirm by
monitoring the truck

247
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,200
so this was the first time I'd actually
personally

248
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,340
heard MF tones being used to complete
phone calls

249
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,199
problem years the odd thing about the
asterisk

250
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,520
code is it was originally designed to be
used on

251
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,210
radio systems 10 the SF signal the SS
yes F signal

252
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,440
switch which wanna talk about so it was
obvious the MFT

253
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,000
maps on signaling was included Masters
obviously for

254
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,380
backwards compatibility with all trunk
systems

255
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,470
now the thing is that in order to make
this blue box since that was my ultimate

256
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,130
goal

257
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,750
was to make it possible to see strikes
again

258
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,790
what I need to do is figure out if
number one

259
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,418
asterisk was capable all using single
frequency trunk signal

260
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,570
the so-called 26 hurts saw in order to
signal the

261
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,668
availability truckloads namely my
virtual

262
00:19:14,669 --> 00:19:17,919
I created now it was apparent to me

263
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,690
that asterisk have the capability as
Walter just said

264
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,659
see it was included because somebody

265
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:29,320
the original author was planning on
using it for some

266
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,230
arteries to do signaling over radio

267
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,590
now why anybody would want to 2600 hurts

268
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,540
single frequency trucks over review

269
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:45,530
like did add to the complexity factor
gettings work because essentially

270
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,960
everything was

271
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,790
the logic everything was sorted inferred
from in original

272
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,730
what I discovered some months later

273
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:59,040
actually developing

274
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,260
is that the the single frequency from
signaling really

275
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:06,750
work obviously it was a work in progress
that did not have a very high priority

276
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,830
on the authors

277
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,040
for my kids so I was basically on my own
to get this work

278
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,700
on the biggest challenge getting this to
work

279
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,530
was that new that based on the way

280
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,690
Road the the trucking supervision

281
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:29,020
not based on timing we needed to be
based on time

282
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,129
because in order for you to be able to
sees a truck

283
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,340
yourself ok the whole system has to be
based on sign

284
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,908
when I see timing I mean that if 2600
hurts

285
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:43,600
its present trauma beyond a certain
threshold

286
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,970
it means that the calls hopscotch very
simplistic terms

287
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,820
if you are able to make 26 hurts through
artificial

288
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,110
means within a certain threshold

289
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,110
you basically keep the trunk of hook and
make

290
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,389
ready to receive tones tricking you into
thinking

291
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:05,940
that it's talking the switch on the

292
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,990
now bear in mind not this really exist
this is a simulation

293
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:13,210
my computer running masters

294
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,750
so there were a lot of challenges
getting the store

295
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,610
in fact I'll just work weaker to

296
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,669
the are getting the trunk sick

297
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:31,060
time to work was was a real challenge
the original author actually

298
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,690
wrote it in such a way that was
incorrect

299
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,440
he completely throughway the timing
factor

300
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,440
in favor of law what's known as week
star

301
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,750
week start basically doesn't care
anything about timing

302
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,590
26 basically looks for the presence of
wings

303
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,050
Witcher very short alerts 2600

304
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,220
where its only relevant if here's a wink

305
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,940
or doesn't this is not what's

306
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:03,090
was really conducive to the way I want
to make that run work

307
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,340
because it's not the traditional way the
trucks work back

308
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,939
days basically to summarize

309
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,919
like I said before the presence of 2600
hurt so much

310
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,300
meant that the truck was not use when
remote into the trunk

311
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,230
wanted to use it it would basically
remove the 2600

312
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,399
hurts for a brief time applying and then
remove it again

313
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:32,280
this was known as shop the remote side
with them removed 2600 hurts from the

314
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,690
line

315
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,010
completely and respond with another
people 26

316
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,389
hurts signaling that it was ready to
receive digits

317
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:42,450
that's what you just heard quickly

318
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,860
when I placed a call sees the truck got
the small

319
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,320
signal the of towns we conversed

320
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,350
David yards home so

321
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,169
one side the trunk seizure work

322
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,000
timing factor working these I was faced
with

323
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,750
nope which was the sensitivity

324
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,250
of times now bear in mind i'm
introducing

325
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:13,639
mast songs through pocket-sized
electronic device

326
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:18,060
all questionable clarity questionable
athletes

327
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,800
because I'm basically feeding into the
microphone itself on

328
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,010
going over Voice over IP which is now
being

329
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,710
digitized sample converted into see
protocol

330
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,220
sent through my phone system and then
converted into

331
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,950
the proper form what was it in the
beginning I think it only detected the

332
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,070
three

333
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,600
it was really because if we monitored
the trunk line

334
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,810
whole asterisk itself placing the call

335
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,560
we can actually hear it tones loud and
clear it was me

336
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,240
of course its calls went through every
time home

337
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,409
which was great all it did was prove

338
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:02,639
okay we got 26 heartsick work

339
00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:05,720
we got the MS signaling working book

340
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,690
influences in any way without the
ability to

341
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,950
influences from outside boxing's

342
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,480
if all we could do is listen to a phone
system making songs

343
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,129
all you have is basically you know a
really great simulator

344
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:25,950
you can for us water with I

345
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,399
by Tom no but seriously the thing was to
get it to

346
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,530
allow us to inject songs into the system

347
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:37,740
understand and allow us to route calls

348
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,639
artificial now the thing again was
sensitivity

349
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:45,090
and it turned out that MS detection
portion

350
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:49,240
all of the Astor source code bearing in
mind every step of the way

351
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,790
water source code modifications astor's
which

352
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,790
you want to mention I am planning to
make any

353
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:00,960
managers the whole point to this
obviously is to share with people

354
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,300
I want as many people as possible to put
these plaster systems

355
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:09,790
so we can actually connect to each other
and blue box to each other

356
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:16,790
because

357
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,470
in the spirit of up sharing I I
obviously didn't do this

358
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,700
with any monetary mind I can imagine how
I would

359
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,629
this any arm but I just gonna be really
a lot of fun to make

360
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:33,780
make total simulation the phone system
essentially

361
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,070
work you probably noticing

362
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,340
really nothing on-screen except us the
reason I did

363
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,850
is very interesting but it has
historical reasons

364
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,230
and that's that the first thing that I
told the manual

365
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:53,440
when I had the idea to present this is
that I want to apply in person to be

366
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,990
able to enjoy

367
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,020
and the reason why I said that is very
important

368
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:03,090
arm lot of the counter-culture that
developed around

369
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,679
exploring the telephone network to the
use of the stones

370
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:13,040
was done by line the main reason was
because

371
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,830
we're talking in the seventies there was
no real personal computer

372
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,139
this those this is a way that you could
program

373
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,909
some without able to see

374
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,399
this was its whole network that's spam

375
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,659
the entire planet that allowed you to
program it

376
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:34,490
using simple tones well this is
something a blind person understands

377
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,710
that he can do

378
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,840
I mean maybe somebody has to make the
device for him

379
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,760
but once that's done he's free to
explore only once

380
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,100
so I thought it would be really
interesting maybe at some point if there

381
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,409
are any

382
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:50,620
blind people around who are interested
or maybe a

383
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,210
heard about this from historical
standpoint

384
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:58,379
might want to get in touch with me after

385
00:26:58,379 --> 00:27:01,639
after the conference what I did do I
want to mention now

386
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:06,610
is registered the domain project MF dot
com

387
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,830
while I don't have a website up there
yet I do plan to put up

388
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,010
a message board where

389
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,620
I will be making the source code
modifications available

390
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,860
and also allow us to discuss the project
further

391
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,230
and I'd like to get as many people
involved as possible who have

392
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:28,280
experience not only with blue box Inc
but also

393
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,550
traditional telephony experience and
even experience with Asterisk

394
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:36,210
if possible so we could continue the
development of this project

395
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,950
again I'm doing this in my spare time
has nothing to do with

396
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,710
my my professional work and I'm just
glad that I was able to get it to work

397
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,620
in time for

398
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,120
the conference and really bring it all
together

399
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,740
what I want to do now is I wanna turn
the mike over to Cheshire

400
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,350
and i'd like him to described the
culture

401
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:03,270
thats back in the seventies us when me
and Walter were

402
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:08,190
trying to revive real boxing back in the
eighties

403
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:12,620
it was serve a different culture going
on because the computer revolution

404
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,770
had already taken place so really we
have a combination

405
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,899
people were were hacking the phone
network by ear

406
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:23,840
computers and telephone switches and so
on

407
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,899
and also we were trying to do the retro
because we thought that things

408
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:34,159
John the audience and and Cheshire did
which is really cool

409
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,440
the idea of being able to program a
computer or network

410
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,540
sounds alone just sounded like something

411
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,040
was just yeah awesome this and the fact
that we could hone our

412
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,350
electronic skills at the same time in
order to

413
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,780
constructive ice is like this in order
to

414
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,480
performance was was really bringing
together a lot of different disciplines

415
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,629
programming you know knowledge of

416
00:29:00,629 --> 00:29:04,050
of telephony knowledgeable electronics
mom

417
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:08,010
but again back in the seventies this
really this didn't exist there was like

418
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:12,330
this this counter culture that existed
around electronics portion

419
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,899
and the audio portion of it alone
tonight I'd like to shoot

420
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,809
described was like in the 70's just the
whole blue boxes

421
00:29:21,809 --> 00:29:25,440
here backtrack

422
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,529
and that stands for multi-frequency as

423
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,980
of course single for

424
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,270
actually came from here in my house
ironically

425
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,860
here in mouth signaling was it had to do
with

426
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,240
the actual checks that were plugged into
the cork boards

427
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,220
back in the days when before telephone
switches exist

428
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,760
where operators basically completed your
call after asking you what number please

429
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,279
here in mouse referred to the actual
Jack

430
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,360
part went to her your part went to her
now

431
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,789
this type signaling was obviously very
crude but it was

432
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:06,200
typeof 4-wire signaling which is carried
over

433
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,440
into electromechanical signaling system

434
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,620
which sprung into existence and it was
simply shortened to hear them sing

435
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,830
and this was initially used over short
distance

436
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,658
to signal the availability of trust
between central office

437
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:27,750
okay where to begin early

438
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,830
I first started picking up a copy per
square magazine

439
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,470
stationed overseas people knew I was
interested in phones

440
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,890
a church service in this article square

441
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:42,929
this was of course October 1973

442
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:46,250
secrets little blue box by Ron Rosenbaum

443
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,470
it was not go above hooker

444
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,960
cap crunch with a little was little
cereal box

445
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,590
and and the town house leaders

446
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,409
utilized as well from their

447
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:05,370
a I somehow heard about small newsletter
called

448
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:10,809
tap time with third world row. American
party

449
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:16,570
ok to be know before tap with your pool
the youth international party line

450
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,770
now this goes back to the days %uh rural
telephony

451
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,850
where you had one where the ran down the
road

452
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,250
well one offender each farmhouse and
everybody was on the one

453
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,350
trunkline it was a party why

454
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:33,360
a if above the operator rang

455
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,159
regs too long and one short that was the
Smiths

456
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,789
too short someone along that was the
Joneses you know the families along

457
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:42,289
party lines

458
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:47,309
and yes usually had yell because when
the phone rang every long departed

459
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:52,740
pick up in and trials in on the
conversation as well

460
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,940
the youth international party was the
hippies

461
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,279
abbie hoffman his crowd on number nine
Bleecker Street

462
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,299
and the year bull newsletter was formed

463
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:07,929
by Abbie Hoffman and iPhone free who
called himself

464
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:11,029
L bell absurd as you

465
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,289
international party line to share
information about

466
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:17,440
our telephones and our telephone
networks

467
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,970
and how the revolution could get free
phone calls

468
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,309
well about here to enter this a project

469
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,399
elbow look to the second newsletters is
always pop political crap it

470
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,130
as was also photographed with my
technological newsletter

471
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,320
so I picked up his marbles when a
broadway few blocks and

472
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:39,860
set up as tap the technological American
party

473
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,640
well it turned out that it's very
difficult at the time

474
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,309
to open up a checking account with the
word party in your name was reported by

475
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:48,940
political party

476
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,500
so it became the technological American
program

477
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,690
for official purposes

478
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:01,760
but see ago turned over to a phone freak
from New Jersey call Tom

479
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,908
edison by the time I

480
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,980
moved to New York City and got involved
in tap

481
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,419
I was running the show I maybe I should
be introduced elbow

482
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:14,690
once I'd really can't recall but

483
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:17,990
up the whole idea behind your pool
behind tap

484
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,399
was to share the knowledge the
information about

485
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:26,110
how to crawl through networks how locks
were

486
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,029
how to explore the technology up your
daily life

487
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,929
are everyone had a telephone in their
home even then

488
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,320
are now we can run our pockets

489
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,928
we were the people curious enough to
wonder how they work

490
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:46,610
how to explore those networks and play
with them

491
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:49,730
the idea of playing with technology was
just you know

492
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:52,909
something we thought was marvelous their
books on are why would you want to do

493
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,640
that God

494
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,789
and but we persevered we I found out
more about

495
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,010
what we like to do and

496
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:08,659
eventually absurd me each other your boy
actually put on conferences

497
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,669
up before I moved to New York I got down
to a conference

498
00:34:11,668 --> 00:34:14,870
people who put on in The Diplomat Hotel

499
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:18,918
New York City a plea that was nineteen
seventy three or four

500
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:22,408
and it was it was and

501
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,510
anarchistic free-for-all you are talking
about this go to that corner others

502
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:27,350
large bar

503
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:32,480
go back to back with a big ballroom
other thing over in the corner

504
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,609
because you go was for a bit get bored
go to the other corner meet somebody in

505
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,290
the middle

506
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:41,139
start talking it it was a great
free-for-all free-form kind of

507
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,330
environment

508
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,418
and we share the knowledge

509
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,739
you know somebody knew this about that
little network

510
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,450
that about the other and we just don't
talk with each other

511
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,020
a few articles came out but I'm sure

512
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,490
and what we could be put to tap

513
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,500
we kinda borrowed a line from the New
York Times

514
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,609
changed to our own devices that were
that was all the news that's fit

515
00:35:06,609 --> 00:35:11,850
we have format our magazine 1 a.m.

516
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,270
it was a lot of camaraderie through the
post

517
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,440
you know sent through the mail and

518
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,120
our readers were just rather hooker
stuff

519
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,390
I I still Clark much admiration to this
day just because I help the public

520
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,089
them

521
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:34,730
they were fun times which thats

522
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:37,980
newsletter was at the first place friend

523
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,810
that plans to build the blue box for
published

524
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,839
II was a good answer but it's very
possible

525
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:50,630
it's very possible a it was you know
strictly go

526
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,630
oscillators 7 slater's for 07
frequencies

527
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,420
and done a matrix arrayed for the
buttons

528
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,279
to cross them have you

529
00:36:03,279 --> 00:36:06,569
well like to explain it is that your
touch-tone telephone at home with a

530
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:08,630
certain center frequencies

531
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,160
if you would ask the are free to place a
call for you in those days

532
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,170
operators dial without a different
server is that directly controlled

533
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:21,040
along lines network and the blue box
duplicated the operators frequencies

534
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,670
thats life's work for

535
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,870
the box me we refer the MF times for
those

536
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,609
operators frequencies separate them from
the touchstones

537
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,420
formerly a registered trademark 0

538
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,870
which are the touchstones being work on
but touchdowns were also

539
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:43,259
multi-frequency towns we just use those
as it nears

540
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,260
and I have gone up on US

541
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,839
our PTO dot gov US Patent and Trademark
Office

542
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,890
are with all the shenanigans up AT&T

543
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,120
changing hands dying being reborn with
SBC

544
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,880
buying a few more things the trademark

545
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,569
touchdown is no longer owned by AT&T

546
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:10,880
II about that me it's not owned by
anyone at all

547
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,270
don't believe it's owned by anyone all
manual should

548
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:18,170
yeah a

549
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,980
yeah could get interesting who are you
for

550
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,140
so you no longer have

551
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,370
circle are afterwards after

552
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,259
in articles I ever have a question for
you I'll

553
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:35,529
were you were you involved in there were
some the

554
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:39,150
they were really conference bridges but
they were like for example always busy

555
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,760
numbers

556
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,470
bridged people together I use them back

557
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,400
no responsibility whatsoever things sir

558
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,130
I really never had my own blue box

559
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,560
I've John the west coast 17

560
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,600
demo are I

561
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:02,000
when I was living upstate New York Bowl
or a blue box

562
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,140
place 3 telephone calls the first was
the 303

563
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,990
499 7111 the National Institute of
Standards time signal in Boulder

564
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,819
Colorado

565
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:15,850
which I like to listen to on shortwave
is the BWB

566
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,810
a then I used now that pic above

567
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:23,440
the IPL newsletter and suppose by red

568
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,690
I got to the White Plains under and from
there

569
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,250
to the Telus first recording in London
England

570
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:34,430
so you know finally proved myself yes
the stuff really does work

571
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:38,460
there keep in mind this is the seventies

572
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,870
i dial directory assistance 9

573
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,759
10 555 1212

574
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,890
now today 10 with the North Carolina
area

575
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,009
but then the or X 10 area codes were
called

576
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:56,680
special area code and in fact were part
of the Twix teletype

577
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,850
network TWX teletype writer

578
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,560
exchange oh and this is a completely
separate network from the telephone

579
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,630
system

580
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:08,029
yeah right 910

581
00:39:08,029 --> 00:39:12,850
555 1212 drug resistance number for
teletype machines

582
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,380
I heard it ring click

583
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,470
the modem tell a bell 103 modem

584
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,850
for Twix teletype machine I new

585
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,330
it was interconnect the interesting
thing that's worth mentioning about

586
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,990
boxing is that you had access to

587
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,690
dial reach a lot of numbers that you
simply couldn't reach

588
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,299
direct dial into your normal telephone
there are a lot of numbers that would be

589
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:39,830
considered

590
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,620
invalid if you dial them that way you
are now able to dial

591
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:47,839
they weren't I'll entire telephone
networks that you were able to reach

592
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:51,600
boxing that you wouldn't be allowed to
Tyler

593
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,500
that switched network is one there was
other networks like autos honorees

594
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:00,950
military and things like that all sorts
of private telephone networks that were

595
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:01,510
actually

596
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,540
bridge together with the public
telephone network

597
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,720
either directly or indirectly were now
reachable

598
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,569
and other thing I want to mention also
in

599
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:17,230
in bring up my my asterisk system
asterisk allows you to be very free-form

600
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,410
what it calls extensions extensions
essentially could be considered

601
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,779
routing coz if you were on traditional

602
00:40:24,779 --> 00:40:27,960
telephony switch you would define of its
routes

603
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,049
or routing codes and you you would
basically defined

604
00:40:32,049 --> 00:40:36,150
go to internal things test numbers and
so on and so forth

605
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,440
arm what you heard earlier which was
really loud obnoxious tone

606
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,560
was thousands were hurt stone which was
traditionally

607
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,040
used to measure signal to noise ratios

608
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,589
this was known on telephony georgann

609
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:56,279
know what's best I actually

610
00:40:56,279 --> 00:41:01,520
mimic that by creating on routing code:
102

611
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:06,240
because back in the old days used to
actually see citron

612
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,310
key polls 102 St

613
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,900
thousands words stop the thing is

614
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,460
is that you can really recreate a lot of
these

615
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,799
routing code: news really

616
00:41:19,799 --> 00:41:24,109
to your heart's content using astor's
and I thought to be really cool

617
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:28,240
if we get some people to bring up some
the switching systems

618
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,609
you know with these simulations have
talking to each other

619
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:34,750
basically bridging to the public
telephone network over

620
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:38,540
Voice over IP which is essentially

621
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,990
so it looks like you're actually making
a traditional call

622
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:45,730
over the public switched telephone
network and getting 2600 hurt

623
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:48,500
supervision when you connect

624
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,460
and who box from from there

625
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,310
also being able to do that reverse dial
in from the outside

626
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:59,549
so this is something that has really
been possible

627
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:02,730
very very long time now what

628
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:07,180
what I'd like to do is exam questions
from the audience

629
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,450
anyone out there have a blue box with
them anyone out to the audience with the

630
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,060

yeah job side box is still illegal

633
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,819
you might be interested to know them
there 18th June of this year the last

634
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,270
into carrier

635
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:28,670
went belly-up I believe independent film
company summer in the midwest

636
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,230
that basically for Winnie and that's it

637
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,650
yeah that's it and so I was invited to
get on the conference call and make a

638
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:37,960
blue box call

639
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,290
a of course by gratefully declined

640

their illegal still in california
earlier you were talking about though

641
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,049
coz I feel every little bit on that

642
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:51,529
the cost of an operator Italian 2009 one

643
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:54,770
one you actually open with a key files

644
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:59,120
Kiki 2009 121 star

645
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,130
that would connect you to the Stockton
operator but there are other cities

646
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,670
in the 2009 area code at that time

647
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,170
there was in the best 0 and there was
also Fresno

648
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,440
for Modesto it out 2009 all 44

649
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,620
121 permit modesto Italian something
else

650
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:22,100
and in the phone trips slash

651
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,230
white web website and doorbells

652
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,500
the 10 a.m. stacking tutorial yes up
there

653
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,569
talks about Youngstown Ohio

654
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:36,880
which I drove through the issue young
and I

655
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,930
course I pay for Mitch to the handsome

656
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:43,390
on the way but that particular

657
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:46,589
Kate shows how you stack tendons

658
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:50,470
is only worked on number one crossbar
switches over to wire

659
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:53,859
tandem switches not the four a switcher
for where

660
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,200
tendons regions it sees ok codes that I

661
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:01,180
little life exploring you found a whole
lotta interesting things

662
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,440
914 0 52 star

663
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,830
the you get into the AT&T conference
bridge

664
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:12,259
at that point you can use your
touch-tone telephone to

665
00:44:12,259 --> 00:44:16,370
make calls you dial pound for unit I'll

666
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,480
a different kind of tone any doubt area
code number

667
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,020
and you hit actually the pound a record
number star

668
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,040
now is that what she could to keep us
and start

669
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,290
and then you do you did found three

670
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:34,259
and yet another guy online and the new
dial his number

671
00:44:34,259 --> 00:44:37,500
and then area code star and the

672
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,700
and then getting together you count five
and

673
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,870
tie them together I was gonna have to
bring you back for

674
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,060
also others next year at school for

675
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:50,710
are you talking about going down on a
time when a guy could work both

676
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,500
thanks yes good okay I'll free were

677
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,880
BoxTone any thoughts about yes the
future

678
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,770
boxing well any thoughts about what a
CTS

679
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:05,670
home are you talking about boxing up to
pay for my living room which is

680
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,000
for yeah %uh actually I'm not aware of
any

681
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,680
functionality an asterisk second
actually decode the

682
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,259
automated calling toll system zones but
that's not to say I couldnt

683
00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:20,690
right mom there's

684
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,799
really a the good thing about me
developing this project

685
00:45:24,799 --> 00:45:28,580
is I got to really dig into the
internals a master's

686
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:31,859
and I feel pretty confident at this
point being able to make

687
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:36,000
do pretty much anything one its are but
that would be a cool idea actually for

688
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,660
anyone is not familiar

689
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:43,060
on up until the late 90's it was
possible to make free phone calls on

690
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,730
pay phones by of mimicking the nickel
dime quarter tones

691
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:51,560
which were different a sequence 0 tone
pairs

692
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,569
in order to simulate the insertion

693
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:58,400
money into this om and this could be
used to

694
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,109
obviously circumvent

695
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:06,589
he charges basically are this is done by

696
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,890
large number of people in fact if you
were here for the the

697
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,220
the talk for aid

698
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,460
burning yes is actually prosecuted for

699
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,960
processing such a device this purpose

700
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
yeah next question please hi I'm aspects

701
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,190
hope doing local here

702
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,869
also contributor to PBX but I wanted to
tell you about

703
00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:35,290
new program of FreeSWITCH FreeSWITCH

704
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:38,660
work specifically

705
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,899
FreeSWITCH has the feature called
telethon

706
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,980
in the red spider monkey module are

707
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:49,670
mots spider which is JavaScript

708
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,760
and you might find a very interesting to
know about that because you could

709
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,900
program a javascript is fully

710
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,359
a synchronous programming to designed
this type of thing it

711
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,980
Lynn if you work in a strict %um you
know it's kind of hard to deal with some

712
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,660
the coats

713
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,379
even India apt I'll functioned 17 pages

714
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:12,670
I believe yeah it is it's terrible I i

715
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:18,020
you know I a quote beavis and butt-head
can't polish a turd

716
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:21,109
astor's he has been around long enough
that it's kinda turned into the kitchen

717
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:22,910
sink phone system

718
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,649
so there's there's a lot of crossed
level left over from

719
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,349
from years just like slapping stuff on
top

720
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,750
up the check it out wanna come up after

721
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:41,170
