17
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,690
something called

18
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,640
a biological science fiction which I
have no idea what that is

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,030
I'm coming up we have

20
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:27,030
hackers and academia with

21
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,220
number 21 number ninety number 144

22
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,890

differences

28
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,489
which problems

29
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,190
as well tries

30

recently my months ago

36
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:08,010
work with promised

37
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,349
out for software systems ok

38
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:34,349
computer networks more secure

39
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:41,060
for some time called so

40
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,060
secure work

41
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:01,520
company its

42
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,520
spin so work

43
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,139
yes

44
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:21,139
work mark

45
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,969
marks its

46
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:33,969
Res my experience

47
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:42,979
which works

48
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:50,289
so

49
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:56,340
is member

50
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:03,340
career

51
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,440
release computer

52
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,900
things so

53
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Prince

all

58
00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:39,620
theoretic interest

59
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,620
so when I think

60
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,200
want to go

61
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,050

hundred-dollar bills take

66
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:38,729
it was just

67
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,550
perfect

68
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,160
boss

never week

70
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:23,550
some

71
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,329
but they were

72
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:36,200
Windows to the office

73
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,800
way with this is

74
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,910
class with

75
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,380
upstairs

76
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,990
down this

77
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,050
the perfect

78
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,540
people

79
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,279
to it their tracks and

80
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,399
for school

81
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,399
microscope basically

82
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:38,230
now

83
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,490
industry and the

84
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:57,110
research area was computer security

85
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,949
well

86
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:10,450
people special

87
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:17,190
artists were

88
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,970
doing things like transistor

89
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,830
direct connection to the company

90
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,950
less

91
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,710
business

92
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,360
you know

93
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,360
so i'd

94
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,040
3 University

95
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,040
member substantial

96
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:09,260
work

97
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:16,460
differences academic

98
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,300
world

99
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,820
your own boss in

100
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,000
world approved

101
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
your actually contributing to the
company

102
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,380
the sea very small

103
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,320
you know research do have to raise money

104
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,550
attract investors

105
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,200
companies support research

106
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,100
things for doing you are fundamentally

107
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,630
tomorrow decide computer security

108
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:21,630
was interesting

109
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:34,080
very difference just perfect

110
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,100
right now the

111
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:46,630
think

112
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,330
you'd

113
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,279
for to produce

114
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,279
professors were

115
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,720
I think about

116
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:18,700
in a very broad sense sense

117
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:31,380
system also from from worked in

118
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,790
in different departments history
lectured

119
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:43,790
its

120
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:47,810
word wonderful

121
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,810
like

122
00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:00,210
rights program

123
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:07,210
program

124
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:15,360
so I for the last years

125
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:23,010
i'd the most somebody

126
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:27,520
incurred everybody here next

127
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:34,520
tax return

128
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:42,370
so anyway

129
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,790
to also

130
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,230
used as well

131
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,940
with

132
00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,940
technical trashed large

133
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:08,750
result

134
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:18,730
100

135
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,320
electronics see

136
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:30,320
marks

137
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:40,170
with me

138
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,060
more integrated schools

139
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,300
leninist

140
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,779
University no I'm not gonna be a teacher
we do other things

141
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,770
start schools some

142
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:09,539
this is my third hope never guess
PowerPoint

143
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,980
try to keep

144
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,380
so I've been in this doctoral program
communications

145
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,390
education specifically winners

146
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:25,140
virtual worlds for three years things
surprise me

147
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,730
everything said why school sucks was
absolutely correct

148
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,370
actually researched

149
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,929
quotes from people

150
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:45,710
stuff file stuff from

151
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:49,210
a couple read like

152
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,240
Waterford hi actually no

153
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,929
which induced schools which this way

154
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,220
whose the process yourself now you

155
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:05,470
yourself going through high school

156
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,490
mistrust 30 promote decentralization

157
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,990
tenants from hackers

158
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,710
want the big things we talk about is

159
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,710
stage see stage lecturing

160
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,970
you speak

161
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,760
construct more education

162
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,820
where students get to define problems

163
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,649
its direction

164
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,039
basically works it's just

165
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,399
obviously school there something

166
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:46,029
we've been talking about this time for
lecturing

167
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:50,039
article mentions here its

168
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,230
after get

169
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,580
around compare details

170
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:03,168
goals really does work

171
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:09,090
helps people

172
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:14,049
always yield hackers want to get into
things

173
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:17,250
touch them test sees

174
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:21,370
is absolutely also instinct there's a
lot of movements

175
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,169
education you case-based

176
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,169
that's basically like law school legal
cases you actually look at

177
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:35,140
past past

178
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:38,529
doctor cases symptoms

179
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:42,289
actually dissect

180
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:46,010
earliest

181
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,120
trying

182
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,350
was a great match for some

183
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,100
this real-world abstractions

184
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,140
basic X abstract work problems

185
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:07,299
really not the best way

186
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:10,660
this program

187
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,710
im

188
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,600
discover yes your mailing

189
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,150
you yes

190
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,299
students just go through just
discoveries

191
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,179
theorems like

192
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,400
is actually process three times

193
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,850
ways do with

194
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:47,190
help students

195
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,960
just was actually something

196
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,020
from list Eagle

197
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,270
cast week actually just

198
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:05,240
basic in context which makes

199
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,929
people just text books they take cues
from

200
00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:12,929
the context schools like wise

201
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:17,270
not structured the same last why can't I
go

202
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,879
really problems text

203
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,920
with works obviously so

204
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,100
teaching

205
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,840
hacking curious degrees

206
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,770
a lot of the things we SAT testing
obviously is not the best way

207
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,200
test is

208
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,410
structure don't have simple solutions

209
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,450
really just regurgitating answers

210
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,200
school

211
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,340
the other thing just

212
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,870
you can actually explain you can go out

213
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,230
this particular obstacle you can just do
it ride

214
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,030
school ask people

215
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,360
works work

216
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,450
just is not difference

217
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,809
where people

218
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,540
information powerful good

219
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:30,440
expertise you're saying about work

220
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,510
artists years things like this

221
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,710
your from workplace

222
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,280
school obviously teachers are just

223
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:46,428
really practice really do things

224
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:50,790
something actually its

225
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,240
its takes peopled

226
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,940
certainly well teachers

227
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,020
X

228
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,600
also soared

229
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,760
isolating students it's all up to you

230
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,299
used

231
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:17,590
you can for things your computer

232
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:24,370
your peers also real works

233
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:30,010
that's also school

234
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,500
up

235
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,549
which is the best ways to teach

236
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:44,790
the absolute forward schools

237
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:51,428
with work with a little help teacher

238
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,510
support they were able to progress

239
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:01,510
they were being just

240
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:05,668
explain X program just

241
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,870
these users who preferred

242
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,059
necessary

243
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,340
says work

244
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,270
also getting people to reflect you sort

245
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,710
problem okay

246
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,559
I think tried this next or

247
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,649
here hypotheses

248
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,200
those cycles make will transfer

249
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,150
schools like you'd

250
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,480
never context

251
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:52,720
realistic situations so all the things
that we know why do we have these

252
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,950
obviously crossed prop

253
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,280
schools are a bunch accreted

254
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,820
its years with bills

255
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,010
standardized grading things like from

256
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,280
this idea that students are products

257
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,660
just actually did talk

258
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,830
we should have should to the list

259
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,020
dust workers obviously is is
particularly useful for us

260
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,070
technology

261
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,730
that still system schools people could
that way

262
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,750
with a comfortable really work teachers

263
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,770
schools very hard

264
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:42,049
national also its left

265
00:25:42,049 --> 00:25:45,470
like he ought to be Street

266
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,570
just passed

267
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,470
Florida force this where histories to be

268
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,150
fact something

269
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:59,200
people past with few points

270
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,120
so there's real trend working against
the biggest problems

271
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:09,450
care all about child abuse

272
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:13,610
telling students deficit explore their

273
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,620
questions fight

274
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,710
with every it's basically causing all
teachers to teach

275
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,080
tasks just we're

276
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,530
conferences like RC conference

277
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,570
teachers school

278
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,659
kid shelf little truck

279
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,510
over teacher we had recess

280
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:42,250
canceling recessed mass

281
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,100
actually canceling keep the kids from
running around

282
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,010
completely Council so

283
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:57,010
this is really just schools it's
destroying any

284
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:03,168
I know posted like I was chance to go to

285
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,900
ask

286
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:13,770
for you standardized tests i'd

287
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,460
schools anything like you know if you
have a one-size-fits-all education

288
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,520
system have teachers are like you must

289
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,049
recesses good for you to have your ass
kicked because you have to social

290
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:28,200
order the more we can the more we can
start a fight the way

291
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,710
schools try to turn everybody people you
know best

292
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:38,070
key yes shares

293
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,120
side hack schools

294
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,520
trying to figure out there there is an
increasingly

295
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,650
increasing numbers people were hanging
out school instead

296
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,420
some these people I think you're doing
great way other people are trying to do

297
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:51,680
it

298
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,970
only

299
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,460
are only expose fundamentalist Christian
ideas only support

300
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,870
I do wonder whether if develop more
units

301
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:05,000
more spaces use outside

302
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,930
week of 3rd spaces places where

303
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,030
the school this week happened

304
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,990
course way I'm hoping hackers

305
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,730
I think actually good models for this
already people writer c:

306
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,700
and yeses always

307
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,470
sway keeps actually like to you

308
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,420
witness or not to make

309
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,250
grades like to resume out there

310
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:43,530
didn't get the A's market right now
school

311
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,850
iced readings

312
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,950
articles in New York City this kid
school system so much that they're like

313
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,000
dropping school

314
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,330
it's not drop nothing which

315
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:59,429
deprogramming maybe two or three years
fancy just

316
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:03,120
schools I'd like to be was forced

317
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,740
as well to work charter schools the

318
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:10,630
interesting resources think high-tech
companies

319
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,790
have a lot of resist

320
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,260
Google

321
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,629
work funding possibly their

322
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,910
google also has the same where there
please

323
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:29,130
20 percent job to go do something

324
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:32,190
say after Hurricane Katrina

325
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,440
hoping to maybe lists also

326
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,750
would be anyway maybe help teach

327
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,050
sort side

328
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:50,080
helping kids wanted to say librarians

329
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,840
it's nice

330
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,100
drink oh my god told me not to touch the
computers

331
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,430
there's a lot of a lot of migrants were
very forward-thinking

332
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:06,830
actually library side just

333
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,949
last polished who was

334
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,830
subject the book muscle machine she is
very

335
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:17,870
increasingly doing work with digital
rights

336
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,070
more computers libraries and you know
librarians

337
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:27,760
leaves think resource to also now that
these are a couple things I suggest

338
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,180
reading

339
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,200
help people learn is a great you know
get some there

340
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,990
and what do you teaches at work 3

341
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:43,990
readable book question

342
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:55,430
specifically you lived

343
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:02,500
way

344
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,980
humans construct knowledge thinking a
lot about

345
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:14,460
how years traditional

346
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:21,460
knowledge

347
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,680
swarms experimental next

348
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:34,680
us stereotypically

349
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,720
Beach

350
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:45,720

first you sir also

370
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,380
for the best

374
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,850
its

375
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:15,850
once most

376
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:38,900
I think

377
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,930
possible

378
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,930
this is

379
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,160
acceptable

380
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,240
yes

381
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,670
disrupt alt

382
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,590
success

383
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,390
that's completely protect

384
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:31,990
tax X after 9/11 also

385
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,170
there's a movement afoot you try to
standardize

386
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:39,040
education education much waited

387
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,359
so they're trying say if you're in such

388
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:46,170
such a program you know you're going to
this

389
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,900
nest products which is really sad

390
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:55,370
because I'd sociologist

391
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:58,900
linguists story artist

392
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,380
classicist system re

393
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,700
so like you know I have this release

394
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,830
like weird sick

395
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:14,930
helps it's a prop people's

396
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:20,250
York performs

397
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,640
and

398
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,259
thats

399
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:30,520
freedom

400
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,520
wide degree

401
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,710
he's proven I received a grant from

402
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,300
work

403
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:49,520
is dollars

404
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,109
yourself come back

405
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:57,880
was

406
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,630
one

407
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,270
this for researches

408
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:09,680
read a bunch law

409
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,109
across changed

410
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:23,109
thinks

411
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:36,700
your papers

412
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,859
this actually sales

413
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:44,120
questions I mean very

414
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,160
ways are also

415
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,640
which is just some

416
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,640
when it comes to things like
specifically

417
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,640
comes to you grants from

418
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:08,060
are beginning to ask for equality which
makes

419
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:13,259
their questions West answered

420
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,130
time by

421
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,130
feelings joy

422
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,480
numbers so they're beginning to cut

423
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,570
funding for researched

424
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,900
does this just ask

425
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,390
and it's really actually

426
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:40,950
houses for

427
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:44,090
basic experience

428
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,720

but

447
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:31,230
we we survive political system

448
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,160
donuts

449
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,359

tools

455
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:11,700
take

456
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,379
which exist

457
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,270
from future the current

458
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:30,270
this

459
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,340
speaker

460
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:51,340
months

461
00:43:24,609 --> 00:43:31,609
the

462
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:41,010
open

463
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:46,509
percent

464
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:51,930
up

465
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:58,930
very for classified

466
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,600
what's you just

467
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,359
take

468
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,420
so

469
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:31,350
just

470
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,299
seems

471
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,210
projects

472
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,850
just

473
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:52,850
teachers

474
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,109
thats like

475
00:44:59,109 --> 00:45:06,109
actually see what your work is also web
sites

476
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,250
so or

477
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:14,640
we're suggesting complex

478
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,299
and at the Graduate School

479
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,800
one experience this

480
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,800
articles

481
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,900
my questions up

482
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,600
I'm wondering

483
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,180
this risk management

484
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,470
because in the world

485
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:52,470
there's risks it comes

486
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:57,140
terms quality wondering what you think

487
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:04,140
are the risks spurted

488
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,870
but would of we did

489
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:13,480
may be offended schools

490
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:20,480
structure and what you think

491
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,170
if you produced just

492
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,569
risk miss rest

493
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:36,600
East members

494
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,130
I so so

495
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:43,800
is the same just systems

496
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,180
can go very far away work

497
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:52,259
honestly you can't people

498
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,770
migrates

499
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,290
you know who knows

500
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:07,700
you at least decide think people
actually

501
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,030
yes risk

502
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:18,030
a great space said

503
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,510
risk you know said

504
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:27,850
the stings necessary

505
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,190
which culture side

506
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:35,730
work

507
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,740
I was raised house where

508
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:45,740
my father which is was going to school

509
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,690
Street

510
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,819
there's strong culture want

511
00:47:57,819 --> 00:48:01,029
12 wanted things this

512

school nothing like ride

515
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:28,560
the way questions tickets

516
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,779
for example last really want

517
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:37,460
schools

quest answers so last

519
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:47,170
RC certainly teachers researched

520
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:50,170
because you obviously

521
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,510
question so missed

522
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:57,970
cast

523
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,270
just middle-class

524
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,859
really good

525
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:11,859
read the paper asks questions

526
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,990
culture

527
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:19,680
just

528
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,710
historic

529
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,770
we were

530
00:49:25,770 --> 00:49:30,030
some my

531
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:34,230
box much

532
00:49:34,230 --> 00:49:40,270
so it's really with the issues when you
have kids

533
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:46,819
want them want to learn

534
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:53,819
s

535
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:01,600
breakdowns wise

536
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:14,960
so this

537
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,960
school

538
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:45,230
structure

539
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,339
that works very well for for me

540
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:57,339
its sometimes

541
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:04,540
we think

542
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,580
the syrup

543
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:16,580
still says

544
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:23,630
20 percent 100

545
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:35,110
to think up

546
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:42,770
that's true track

547
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:50,380
this

548
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,240
in fact

549
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,600
world fresh 15 from from University

my

554
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:49,550

556
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,320
things

557
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:17,320
opportunities

558
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:25,280
wonderful

559
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:41,710
the versus learning reef

560
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:49,170
unfortunately

561
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:57,360
people much

562
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:04,360
