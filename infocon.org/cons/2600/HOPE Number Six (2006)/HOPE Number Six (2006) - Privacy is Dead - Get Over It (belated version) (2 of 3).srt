1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:07,060
up

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,830
after a bit of

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,880
or server logs word

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,340
yeah could you be more disruptive no way

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,550
one running okay we're back MapQuest for
example

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:28,420
will take your phone's GPS and will
remotely access MapQuest system

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,369
to tell you where you are what's near
you at any point I'm not

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,050
that's very convenient for you but
there's a big trade off and everything

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,890
privacy convenes MapQuest will be able
to tell

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,040
the person with such and such a phone
number which they could force

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,789
rather rapidly trace is at such-and-such
a location

12
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:50,940
trust me I'll be able to access that at
some point

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,620
he's a real world example which what we
do this for law enforcement and

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,300
and governmental agencies I'm very big
on real-world examples

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,730
Riverside County California if you are a
DWI

16
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,710
if you're convicted of DWI they make you
wear an ankle bracelet

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,890
when you're not in jail they make you
work for your tire service

18
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,990
you have to agree to that if you don't
agree they said no problem

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,570
for 10 where we were yards on early
prime we'll put you in jail druthers the

20
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,409
tracking bracelet would rather chill

21
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,150
I'll take the trucking breast know they
have a program set up

22
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:31,740
using official office of that tells if
your GPS location

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:35,060

that i think is 14 or 16

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,079
for hepatic plays this is the real world
forms

26
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,710
it's that easy and by the way the GPS
trackers this

27
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,750
that they put on the on the guys ankle
is the same one that's in

28
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:57,680
almost all cell phones more personal
information that you give up for

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,570
convenience

30
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:03,450

a great deal now

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,290
over of people mixing and matching
businesses

47

broadband TV

50
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:21,650
it's not going to just be the in the
past if I wanted to find something out

51
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:22,530
about someone

52
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,620
I have to go to multiple sources from
multiple times have information it's

53
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,810
one-stop shopping

54
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,080
you know who you talk to on the phone
when you're in the house what you

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,349
watchin TV

56
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:36,510
and so on and so forth money

57
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:41,370
anything that you do have any interest
involves money

58
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,409
your restaurant

59
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,940
you buy a book you travel somewhere

60
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,379
you payee a parking meter

61
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:55,170
every time you do anything with money

62
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,010
plus cash it struck

63
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,790
everything everywhere every time now by
the way

64
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,069
it's not only attracts but it is now
capped for far far far greater lengths

65
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:09,860
of time

66
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,959
and it's kept in one location another
there is a good reason for that they

67
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,840
want to track terrorist activity

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,540
they want to track wire transfers if a
guy gets three transfers from a

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,150
terrorist facing Yemen

70
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,780
they want to be able to find him I don't
know

71
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,610
why Department of Homeland Security
thinks that

72
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,630
terrorist on use ATM's but they

73
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,690
record everything and because the
Patriot Act

74
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,139
it's kept forever and it's immediately
available to the US government

75
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,870
and by the way that includes Pay Pal Pay
Pal

76
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,280
just have to search all the records for
people who use Pay Pal

77
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,430
in the United States but have bank
accounts

have already been arrested 140

83
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,180
everything that you do its record
everything that you do

84
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:21,490
other information can be extrapolated
from

85
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,699

86
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,600

112
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,389
this is the most insidious gather
information

113
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,750
every time that you do something
commercially

114
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,669
it's reported one way or the other
through credit for purchase

have you contributed to a political
campaign so on and so on and so on

121
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,169
things that can allow a third party

122
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,299
to accurately and immediately deduce

123
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,490
exactly who you are what your
personality is which'll likes dislikes

124

of what's

161
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,540
available out there this is just one
outfit corny marketing they have

162
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,640
something called

163
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,870
court in a pickle lets people who are

164

bills quit

thing for Hispanic people were looking

desperately seeking products domain
registration all

168
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,040
people working from home I know about
this because I bought up that list

169
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,810
before I was able to put water

170
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,670
together myself we do a lot of work comp
investigations

171

for insurance companies of your own a
business from your house

in maybe you shouldn't because i'm
concerned.

173
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,510
outdoorsman product buyers verbal
advantage so on and so forth

174
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:15,870
these are databases that tell you a lot
about the people on the list

175
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,540
by the way this I put up your cousin
just cracked me up

176
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:22,939
this use the basically

177
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,890
the loser marketing list his fault
astrology success

178
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,180
I don't love astrology success customers

179
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,290
have responded to a correct mail
solicitation

180
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,790
or fring n show like intervention

181
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,469
okay 60,000 people

182
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:52,470
not this we'll tell me if you're on this
list your clinical notes

183
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:57,200
to I want to find out if you're gay I
could find a home insurance

184
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
through your purchases through what
books you read through

185
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,459
a whole variety of indicators that you
can extrapolate out to

186
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:08,440
but if I get really lazy I'll check to
see

187
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,730
you access gay web sites or do you

188
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,610
read magazines or respond to
solicitations

189
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,560
specifically targeted for

190
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,649
gay or lesbian persons know this

191
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:25,889
got a packed away show you later if
you're interested there's even a

192
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:26,800
magazine

193
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,010
called palms Proc which is for the
people who are HIV-positive

194
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:35,910
I can't imagine working more on this
from subscribe to that little body no

195
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,420
his HIV positive noises the most on
distrusting I'm a planner

196
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:45,469
but even that isn't a database

197
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:48,950
three major companies which by the way
are

198
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,899
routinely accessed by private
investigators

199
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:56,709
have hundreds of billions of records on

200
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,250
these people take every bit of data that
they can beg borrow and steal

201
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,480
and the amalgamated and they offer
personal profiles

202
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,800
or everybody in america that are
accessible

203
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,930
by one piece of data entry I can put in
your social security number

204
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,810
the whole file comes up I could put in
your telephone number

205
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,029
and the whole file comes up I can put it
your

206
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,790
specific address number by that I mean
Street an apartment number

207
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,230
everybody at that address comes up with
their farms

208
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,639
this is routine now here's what's

209
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,680
in cities not there are good reasons for
this

210
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,279
fun to lend you a hundred thousand
dollars I need to know if you're that be

211
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,269
weasel if you're going to be a nanny in
my house

212
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:46,310
I should be able to find out if your job
loss

213
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,600
but here's where it gets obnoxious

214
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,220
the US government is the largest
customer of these companies

215
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,370
he's with the US government does US
government says

216
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,019
your choice point you've got so many
records in there so useful tools

217
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,019
here's all of our stuff to

218
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:08,199
criminal records contact lists
everything

219
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:13,459
merging with your stuff create a
separate file that's only accessible

220
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:17,899
for law enforcement which these
companies have done

221
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,760
and let us access it on a per search
cases

222
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,380
ChoicePoint accurate margins incisive
also

223
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,199
cool what they do for free I did you pay
us to access your own player

224
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,290
so choice points I said wanna head

225
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,949
did this now I so want to file a Freedom
of Information Act

226
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:44,170
request and find out what sort of
information can the government access on

227
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:51,170
I'll no freedom of information is a
private business records

228
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,690
there there the government provides a
lot of the info

229
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,519
the government accesses the in for
whatever they want

230
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,290
but it's not a government worker very
very sleepy

231
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,959
here's all listed companies purchased by
choice for the past five years

232
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,269
and by the way I could give you 10 pages

233
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:15,699
the easiest thing in the world for you
to do is go on the SEC side look at the

234
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:16,940
10 caseworker

235
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,130
go on their own site probably find this
hymie everything from

236
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,110
insurance screening to DNA screening

237
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,430
public records provider drug testing
company drug screening company

238
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:32,550
insurance rating company medical review
company

239
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,620
DNA identification company
pre-employment

240
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,850
email database before the purpose if
this is

241
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,120
they take any matching point the merger
to go

242
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,930
here's subsidiaries have chose

243
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,860
no here's what's coming facial
recognition

244
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,230
cameras everywhere and cameras
everywhere

245
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,670
that have a brain behind them that looks
at your face insist

246
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,480
thats Paul and reports it into a
database

247
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,550
these or actual

248
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,199
a I'm a

249
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,829
locations of cameras in a spot in
Manhattan

250
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:21,410
I believe that this is that this is
where where Broadway and Seventh Avenue

251
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,180
intercept

252
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,279
98 2003 2008

253
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,490
no england is a good example of where
we're going

254
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,620
it is estimated that in England the
average person just walking around doing

255
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,240
their thing traveling around

256
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,850
have a normal day is on camera was 400
times

257
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:46,820
facial recognition software will allow
somebody to determine

258
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,889
where I am at any given moment of the
day

259
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:55,050
that can fix

260
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,110
you on campus Colorado

261
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,769
University Colorado some guys had a
slogan

262
00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:04,849
you know smokin par

263
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:07,980
University Colorado first ride

264
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,819
putting up the photos of all the people
say film everything no

265
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,869
at you see they put up the photos of
everybody on a Web site

266
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:20,860
so slipshod if you know who this person
is let us know we'll give you 100 books

267
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,579
nobody responded so the winner they got
a program which cost them all up eleven

268
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,698
hundred dollars

269
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,049
the cross-reference these photos with
student ID's

270
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:36,660
every single person identified was a
stew when there are people who

271
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,090
came in of Canada safely from bone

272
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,510
all the students Cup yeah got

273
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,230
identified I got more identified on the
UC web site

274
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:55,230
I would imagine hat a very ugly time for

275
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,059
people love video people love still
photos because

276
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,100
for his number one he cover photo room

277
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:10,169
the the famous has while shooting I love
this

278
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,570
nope although if you look if you look
behind the the Texas Ranger

279
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:19,809
you see the guy who did this we did this
thing to his face

280
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,710
but you know photos overall just thought
I'd throw that out there

281
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,980
no Hughes on no other fairly

282
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,380
insidious technology that's gonna be

283
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,010
cataloging everyone had identified
current location over

284
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:37,600
this is actually in use in England

285
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,500
your ports its Katie recognition
technology

286
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,940
and the theory behind it is you know you
can put on a mustache in a big rush

287
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,350
remarks nose in a way to get a

288
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,730
and and do whatever you want but you
walk down the street to say we're even

289
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,570
if you try to disguise it

290
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,149
you know your your behind as a certain
number of centimeters this where the

291
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,250
I'll I don't know how it works I'm not
an expert on this

292
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,760
but apparently it works really really
well

293
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,760
you know we go into this but I will tell
you that there

294
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,879
used today a product available to law
enforcement

295
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,419
up put up by a company called Empire
North that allows the police

296
00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:22,820
to shoot a radio frequency ID tag

297
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,850
into you and track your that you can
beat a reply to lose

298
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,460
and it's being used by the Copenhagen
Police Department

299
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,870
so I don't know figure out where this is
going to go this is just so

300
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,890
let you know what's in the future and
freaking out a little bit

301
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,660
we're almost done with the with the
generic examples

302
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:48,210
gonna go to rid the region but we're
talking about psychic graphics

303
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,070
cited psychographic is predictive
profile

304
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,850
and it is just remarkably accurate I use
it all the time

305
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,940
the government uses it a hundred times
more than I do

306
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,669
and certain private companies that want
to develop marketing lists

307
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,710
use a thousand more times than mean the
government put together

308
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,409
the first really good use of this was by

309
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:14,549
Volkswagen you know you gotta figure
Germans were

310
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:18,110
come up with something like this but
they found out

311
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:21,200
if you own cat

312
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,159
you bite chunky peanut butter not the
Brent just the chunky kind of peanut

313
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:26,299
butter

314
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,530
you are much more likely to be
interested in buying a VW bug

315
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:35,379
so they boil the catalyst and they
bought the chunky peanut butter list

316
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,950
and they put it together and they have
you know coverage at

317
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,960
day marketed to these people and they
sold it on a VW Bus

318
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,620
the real real marketing campaign

319
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,900
this is used like may edit in political
campaigns these days

320
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:59,500
the first go to do this was of course
what they call Bush's brain call rolf

321
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,320
call roll Michael targets voters

322
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,840
where you live what you're purchasing
habits or

323
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,908
so on and so forth can allow him to
determine within your certainty

324
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,000
who you gonna vote for and how likely
you are to go out to the polls

325
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,140
now if you're inclined to vote for
george bush but the profile shows your

326
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,960
lazy fat ass

327
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,110
he's gonna said a Republican van by to
pick you up to take you to the polls

328
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:32,039
if you are a real enthusiasts and you

329
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,440
are technologically adept you may try to
have you come down to work the phone

330
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,309
banks

331
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:40,340
and that sort of thing it's incredibly
accurate only just ridiculous things he

332
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,459
discovered like

333
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,270
bourbon drinkers are republicans June
drinkers and Democrats

334
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,158
don't know why but it's true

335
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:54,710
world should you should use my database

336
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,059
quiet no heckling or interrupting on
what was going on

337
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:01,980
I don't mean that there are things like
the average American is no I'm friends

338
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,030
drink smoke from the serial ball

339
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,320
each 25 pounds you can deal year

340
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,370
has lost 12 teeth by age fifty to the

341
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:15,450
candy probably and for for smooth peanut
butter over shortly

342
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,539
everything there is to know the No and
they know it connected to individuals

343
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,260
they an

344
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,490
back to the back to the Volkswagen guys
they're doing again with Jeter

345
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,010
they have put out hundreds of thousands

346
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:38,010
up these four farthings it's on the web
is there we go to have you don't you're

347
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:41,870
is once more important than breakfast or
did you sleep last because the time

348
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,990
spent on the Internet

349
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,429
sneaky way of saying you stop him from
your computer all day

350
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:49,549
is the first place you go for
information is the inner you prefer to

351
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:52,668
shop with your friends you like to spend
a quiet evening at home

352
00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:56,640
what the rest do folks were gonna
continue the

353
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,740
examples of quick and dirty
interpretation of data

354
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:04,600
that is available on everybody

355
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:10,900
an air force employee move stock
holdings from Boeing and Airbus

356
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,289
you check flights to iraq before Obama
you buy a book

357
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:18,150
on fighting cancer normally buys a book
and fighting cancer Eliza they were

358
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:18,919
somebody

359
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:23,990
they care about his kids you run a gay
porno movie

360
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:30,159
como you put in address into MapQuest if
you put in address into my quest

361
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,150
you have some temporary or permanent
connection to the address you have an

362
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,919
interest in their trust

363
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,450
you fill a prescription for Xanax you
fill a prescription for violating

364
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:45,370
necessarily in that order here's my
favorite one

365
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,120
push this is from a real case you're on
a plane four times a year

366
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,190
sitting next to the same warm was not
you

367
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:01,760
come on now adults

368
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,460
let's talk about wreck Dakine rick is
not here

369
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:12,460
right Britain luck assays are checking
cuz he's really not a chicken

370
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,490
records in Florida probably gleefully

371
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,409
dancing naked in the young manatee
Democratic Club which user and

372
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:26,850
a leader of arm know he couldn't make it
here he had an early Thanksgiving thing

373
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,940
with his family

374
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,029
he said he would try to make it very
probably wouldn't

375
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:34,090
we put out a call on be off the hook

376
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,860
radio program for a victim a volunteer

377
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,000
the soccer Kendrick said my name is Rick
taken

378
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm willing to be your guinea pig

379
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,210
an that's the actual email at all that
we had was a

380
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,580
domain address and phone first thing I
did was I i win

381
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,059
I read his phone number three so-called
tell a tour or you put in the phone

382
00:24:58,059 --> 00:24:59,190
number gives you name

383
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:03,370
Druce gives you address history data for
social security number

384
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,580
everything from the phone number a
cross-reference businesses and

385
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,100
everything

386
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:14,380
this is the actual told a role in its
report

387
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,970
then I'd put him through skip trace
America which easily

388
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,220
database pose a lot more information or

389
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,740
so on and so forth we pretty well
determined that he was a real gun

390
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,110
so I can recall I said hi Rick how are
you on

391
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,970
Stephen Obama and for this is what we'd
like to do it

392
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,679
he said okay now let me tell you for the
2004 hope convention

393
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,289
I had a volunteer also and the guy Inc

394
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:46,809
came to me before the day before though
convention

395
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:50,500
I think he even come to be called me on
the phone with his lawyer

396
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,799
and he said listen I reviewed everything
you found them he said as a courtesy we

397
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,750
should be everything you from

398
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,130
so I can your situation I sent it to

399
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,960
we called me the next day with his
lawyer which was the day before though

400
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,230
convention said

401
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,110
you know what I know that I gave you
permission but

402
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,669
if you put it up there I'm just to see
in

403
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:15,720
this time went to my lawyers and I said
I want

404
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,520
you most all-inclusive obnoxious receive

405
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,650
release you've ever seen she drew it up
affects the tour ok

406
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,610
got worse his little shaved

407
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:34,830
he agreed to soften we just reach one
paragraph

408
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,580
paragraph through polo remade
disseminate any information about

409
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,870
Lauren's my first given to see

410
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,669
any information about me which obtains
and/or compiles to any person

411
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:49,950
in any venue as it sees fit even if the
dissemination of the information

412
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,039
could cause me harm emotional distress
pain

413
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,158
injury humiliation or ridicule or other
personal or for financial damage

414
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:05,159
and even if the information disseminated
is partially or completely false

415
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:13,230
why okay you'll notice is notarized
signature

416
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,220
I told him I want your last any did

417
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,789
so then with your investigation riddick
notice to just have

418
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:24,230
put this in context let me tell you what
we did what we did

419
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,760
we did not go out into the field now as
an investigator

420
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,039
we do database investigations on
everybody who becomes

421
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:37,010
of interest to us a client a witness a
subject to suspect would have

422
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:41,480
but we always take that information as a
starting point to go out into the field

423
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,020
because you can find out twenty times as
much actually

424
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,440
knocking on doors and talking to people
then you are just from databases data

425
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,309
bases give you a phenomenal sore
important

426
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,250
but that's it we wanted to show

427
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,620
just strictly on a privacy issue basis

428
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,950
what we could phone we can go onto the
field we didn't talk to anybody not even

429
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,419
on the telephone

430
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:09,520
we didn't do any dumpster diving by the
way great source of information on

431
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,700
persons there

432
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,220
garbage we didn't do anything illegal
anything gray area

433
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,610
or anything even though we have you're a
believer will release from me said

434
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,049
King a credit card does my phone does we
didn't do

435
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:25,370
not other we also didn't check a single

436
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,190
non public access governmental the arabs

437
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:33,960
started with her thing called a row
jurors you put in a guy's name address

438
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,299
telephone number

439
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:38,820
and it gives you back every reference on
the net even

440
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,000
on the deep work every reference to the

441
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,919
we then went and ran it through our own
it you know how service called I

442
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:46,250
opportunities

443
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:49,890
and then we use that this factually
something that's being put up it's kind

444
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,500
of a closed system

445
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,840
for investigative associations called

446
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,980
or Inc on more investigators network

447
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,149
when we used to as a beta test subject
to the

448
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:06,620
gauntlet we are medium we almost
immediately goes in

449
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,010
we got his address we got his telephone
number we got isn'ta

450
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,399
social security number date of birth we
got isn't our

451
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:18,760
residences stood missus walrus insist

452
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,330
we found no

453
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,299
who is who and what is a central system

454
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:31,020
with him and I mean less than five
minutes we found that is true name

455
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,539
his social security number his date of
birth everywhere he overlooked

456
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,629
was okay no to pose for a report would
use

457
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,710
a pretty overall good gusta

458
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,980
report we found that is a property owner

459
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,140
I where is a property owner we pulled up
the property details loses all public

460
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,090
worker

461
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,990
we did this through private database
because it's pointless in-house

462
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,580
this is all public record your father

538
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,079
that he downloads podcast because he was

570
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,930
thought we found a winston

history with the real social security

582
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,740

Florida

586
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,869
leading his own life so unless

traveling

588
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:13,190

worried worked out but

589
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:18,310
me just recap on what we were able to

what he reads what he watches on TV

597
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,460
so on and so on and so following a half
hours

598
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,910
not leaving the office stopping drinking
a cup of coffee

599
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,980
that by the way is my mourners leaving

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,720
most people or you go wall who opposed
to being in databases

606
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,880
or they have the feeling you know

607
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,210
they've been gathering info on me for
years

608
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,079
there's nothing I can do about it
privacy is dead

609
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,530
I might as well just get used to it
basically

610
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:42,589
lay down and enjoy it and there really
is a need for a lot of his name

611
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:46,009
have something simple and you thousands
or millions of dollars they have a right

612
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,950
to know what your financial history

613
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:51,220
the creditworthiness is for example
mortgages

614
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,540
pre-employment I wanna know if you're a
blood draw insight about

615
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:01,420
before I use my perceptions for example

616
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,980
if I meet somebody on wall I am or or in
person for that matter

617
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,030
I came back to the whole what drinking
segment

618
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:13,190
I'd like to be able to find out who they
are Morgan

619
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:16,280
if you can marketing problem

620
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,390
you could bring things to consumers

621
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,450
sheeple I feel less annoying one

622
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:26,960
if you are not interested he didn't play
carriers because you're allergic to

623
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,310
peanuts

624
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:33,900
I don't want to be sending you 50 pet
carrier solicitation of course

625
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,950
and I want to be able to effectively
chiefly so my pet carriers

626
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,790
so I can lower the price a lil

627
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,900
another problem is today

628
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,480
I don't know only talking about
terrorism people from overseas whatever

629

very enjoyable

680
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:04,710
who had had his license suspended
eighteen times

681
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:08,430
his license was suspended at the time
that he was driving

682
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:11,960
that killed tell people this is in New
York on

683
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,980
homes in ninety days ago burgers

684
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,880
their doctors get my slow I've
investigated doctors

685
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,440
who have been arrested and convicted for
outrageous felons

686
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,750
undersold of its your right to know if
your doctor is gonna

687
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,690
give you some laughing gas impose he
looked gross

688
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:39,619
okay not to shoot for this book who
knows your photos

689
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,470
on recent history people living in caves

690
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:46,630
still more who jokingly are but

691
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,960
UK so it's a no I V

692
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,030
job in Abyan current this is the guy who

693
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,720
claimed he killed JonBenet Ramsey and
was arrested for

694
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,970
do you know what he didn't at the time
that he supposedly

695
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:05,920
killed JonBenet Ramsey year was a
schoolteacher

696
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,210
and he was a school teacher even after
he got arrested for

697
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,400
being shown which open arms

698
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,420
no so you're going to charity so he's a
perfect example is an example

699
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,810
let me give you the both sides of the
coin

700
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:25,349
here is why the US government wants to
get information on

701
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:29,680
he is an absolute fact that fourteen

702
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,730
home the eighteen

703
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,750
9/11 terrorists could have been
identified was propagated a success

704
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,329
to people the two people would stop know
of in Cali

705
00:45:42,329 --> 00:45:45,790
were all on CIA watching so it's all
well the discussion

706
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,880
how they .bz came to the US will will on
the watch list

707
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,680
but there were no and in all the
terrorists most of the other

708
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,299
tom was willing to want some assurance

709
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:03,680
russ was no of colleague well Mohammed
on another terrorists

710
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,460
lived with them another one used his
frequent flyer

711
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,650
flyer number I'm 50 overs

712
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,490
a common telephone numbers will its
phones

713
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:18,349
if the government have been doing their
job but if the government had been

714
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:21,329
maintaining a cross reference into this
is

715
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:25,420
he's 14 guys wouldn't show

716
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,260
it's a good morning it's a really good
one I'm a New Yorker

717
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,790
I've lived in Israel so pretty much
every word every move

718
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,640
I agree with the idea you need to be
able to put in identifying

719
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,700
who's a bad guy before though so server
don't fly a plane into a building

720
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:46,780
kill 3,000 what machines

721
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,849
well here's the other side

722
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:55,790
since 9/11 US government agencies

723
00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:00,509
have swooped up hold on what's

724
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:04,530
wells close to 2,000 people

725
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:07,790
that they believed was somehow

726
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:11,210
related connected to terrorism much

727
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,920
this is not a thousand people though
they arrested at the very beginning

728
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,579
put them in jail held in forever the
didn't prosecute a single or

729
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:23,119
the zone new cases out of these cases

730
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,809
which if your former law enforcement
agency wherever they are and then you go

731
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,190
to the prosecutor's office

732
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:31,460
and so we think you are prosecutors go

733
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,670
writing of the past

734
00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:39,200
the majority of the eighty percent of
the cases the prosecutor's office is a

735
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,040
you know months people who said anything
eighty percent of the cases

736
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,910
the federal law enforcement Fort Worth
investigating bring the prosecution you

737
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,049
us

738
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,140
the government prosecutors so they work
well

739
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,730
another 10 soon are just sitting on the
sidelines

740
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,050
then you have move

741
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,460
good comes out like seven percent that
were actually prosecution

742
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:14,460
I don't that for those were actually
convicted

743
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:22,640
again on the intended uses data

744
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,259
DNA databases if you're closing blog

745
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:33,260
is all rested and they take DNA from
them which is routinely don't know

746
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:36,950
they not only have boss database

747
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,780
boss DNA in the database they have an
indicator every time

748
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,130
Waterloo Bob rose come to attention

749
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:51,640
either using about me

750
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,930
another thing you need to be aware of
who's wall the US government

751
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:00,919
is gathering game either directly or
through private company

752
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,319
they are closing aggressively even
rapidly closing

753
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:08,829
all the data that you have access to
they are running back out there

754
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:10,770
reclassifying data

755
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,490
even if it's been open for decades we
give you really ridiculous example

756
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:17,910
1971 richard nixon gave a speech

757
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:22,339
and in that speech vulnerable hope paper
on the stats on my website

758
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:26,900
go put down as about 30 examples this is
the most ridiculously

759
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,460
richard nixon 1971 gives a speech

760
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:33,670
but he talks about the small way to
russian missiles

761
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:37,250
that how many missiles they have in
other words how many bombs to land on

762
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,300
our head

763
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,390
that the US government is a Welsh 1971

764
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:45,629
posts page richard nixon press
conference

765
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:50,680
reported ever US Government classified
that the real issue

766
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,040
I truly don't know why whatsoever
brought donuts or two

767
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,980
question is assisting minutes but it's a
truly representative example

768
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:06,589
I love not just 10 minutes now
question-and-answer period thank you

769
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:13,589

Walmart all how's my that will deal on

776
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,230
who is this it would take the when you
place like that

777
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:44,130
and second word he's really worked well
with here as well

778
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,170

Rd online you home safely yes

780
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,640
well there's a would really suck if if
this was you

781
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,670
I that's a good question to give you to
ship

782
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,010
just home let me repeat the question

783
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:07,750
phenomenal two part question first
questions

784
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:12,480
how people get by private medical
history doesn't have a protected

785
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,339
and the second question is how do I
protect my IP address

786
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:19,910
ok give you a second part first

787
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,299
really simple spend a few extra bucks a
month

788
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:28,660
you have a No I do not own this is Russ
or get for example horizon DSL line

789
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:32,220
the research the the connection either

790
00:51:32,220 --> 00:51:35,800
every three days whether you like it or
not for every time you turn a more

791
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:36,609
modern of

792
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:41,930
you've got a actually go to the trouble
of doing that not elisa's

793
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:47,440
shock perfect example those Church of
Scientology subpoenaing anonymizer all

794
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,500
the way in Finland

795
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,750
getting the entire elements who's this
were

796
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:55,510
you if you want to be the other funds up

797
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:59,089
well if you if you have if you have

798
00:51:59,089 --> 00:52:03,320
I mean you need to choose between
between static and dynamic IP address

799
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:08,210
if you choose correctly and turn your
motor on of every time you log on

800
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,380
ninety-nine point nine percent in the
trucking

801
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:15,880
will disappear you know there are some
services that actually track you might

802
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,609
use

803
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:20,549
diffusion waffling nothing you can do
about them

804
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:27,030
no matter what you doing if you log in
as you check your email using wifi cuff

805
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,800
whatever nothing to do but because they
have a right to know if you're the guy

806
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,730
was really painful

807
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,700
serves so that's that's the easy really
easy question

808
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:39,869
I think what you can do to be a
non-issue pretty much in Reno

809
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:44,530
medical records medical records or pro

810
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:48,240
there or the proper to medical reference

811
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,580
not third party rights not

812
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:56,830
if you pay for your xanax with a credit
card not the issue

813
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:01,690
by a book on kidney disease not use you
dario

814
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:07,400
and a number for information on retired
dysfunction

815
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,470
you said 14 insurance

816
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:14,810
we names 10 that is very his prognosis
justification

817
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:18,029
but when your partner so that I was not
even need

818
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:22,250
because you're gonna pay for your change
with your group or

819
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:27,000
when you consider that former moon hide
frankly I'm you have a look at your

820
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,869
profile

821
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:31,770
and look at what you've been rated yet
and see how much to show you look to see

822
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:33,240
if yeltsin sonar

823
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,560
he spoke look at the games you for

824
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,910
specific there's nothing in it might be
like you

825
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:45,730
well all that's all almost nothing in
the medical databases

826
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:50,380
that I can compile on my own but
creative uses for reporting from

827
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,839
notes records or day well

828
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,310
that's the theory you know

829
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:01,130
no mother won't let me just tell you
there was no official or the whole

830
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:03,339
medical workers mostly electronica

831
00:54:03,339 --> 00:54:07,890
the most important rule which means they
must be on database that successful

832
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:13,580
there are 20 gazans move with better
suited to tell you how easily that again

833
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,390
it was electronically maintained by more
work

834
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:21,390
so his forested have a store

835
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:26,890
miss Lawrence a good you the city walk
to a medical records in the city

836
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:31,250
corruption there needs to be a rule that
the doc is keeping a stand-alone system

837
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,380
and so-and-so few

838
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:37,740
the homies you today yet

839
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,089
I'll for small little as

840
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:44,490
you okay for small

841
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:48,440
I probably shouldn't is your questions
as you interrupted

842
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,230
but I like the first part of the
question they can

843
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:56,240
there's a Social Security Death Index
every state nor cross-references it's

844
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,339
done farms

845
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:01,310
and if your social security number is
linked to that person

846
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:05,130
your day even if you up to that's how it
works or

847
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,380
there are thousands of people every year

848
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,040
who have to go down and cry at your
local Social Security office

849
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,609
this is the same way so they would have
so yes I can tell from the database

850
00:55:15,609 --> 00:55:16,609
issue that

851
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:21,170
don't do that you know our own I'll let
you get in which case

852
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,920
good Mike I can do nothing to you next

853
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,710

00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:33,020
things right going axle question

855
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,380
today yes in about a year

856
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,760
no in about a year

857
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,839
it's not it's not a question technology
license plate

858
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:46,930
data is there especially if you go to a
chocolate

859
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:50,839
the slowing down of had put you in
exactly the spa

860

where they want the camera and it'll get
you but spell your to live for

861

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,560
yeah I two summers ago and

867
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,259
days one rises who was using that IP
number at that time

868
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,800
I am NOT talking about to let

869
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:33,330
access to those records i'm talking
about third parties

870
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:38,250
be able to till by the IP number that
you forward to them

871
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:41,520
you will never be safe from your IP

872
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,009
your own he knows who logged in

873
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:50,170
to that IP number at that time you'll
never be free from your ISP

874
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:54,599
knowing who's on that one because the
billing

875
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,069
but i'm talking about. oooh

876

but because you're a victim

878
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,260
I don't generate your IP number so
instantly somebody somewhere is going to

879
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,280
know

880
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,700
that the IP number belongs to someone
who is researching

881
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,780
victims of molestation as an example

882
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,619
