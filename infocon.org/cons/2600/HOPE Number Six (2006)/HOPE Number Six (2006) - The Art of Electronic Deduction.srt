1
00:00:00,939 --> 00:00:03,229
here where

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:08,469
rate is 1700 in the open slot has been
filled by state-of-the-art electronic

3
00:00:08,469 --> 00:00:09,129
conduction

4
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:14,509
this missus hope 6 we have

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,030
ev-one announcement

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,650
a dusty corners on the web has been
cancelled permanently

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:26,070
it is not coming back to my knowledge
there will be a presentation at 12:30

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,500
tonight

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,140
by members the CAS computer club called
biometrics in sci-fi in this room

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,359
so if you're interested in that
presentation it will be at 12:30 there

11
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,320
was a flight delay

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,559
testing done is graciously agreed to
inform and entertain during this time

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,190
so I leave that for we're gonna try our
best

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,140
okay

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,559
so welcome to hope number six everyone

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,989
have a good time so far alright assets
rainy here we go

17
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:00,699
the small crowd here so everybody's
gonna pitch and you know how about this

18
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,559
actually this is a presentation I'll
tell you up front it's gonna be very

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,369
fine I am gonna be calling on people
from the audience to help out

20
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:10,920
it's very it's something that everybody
in here can do and it's nothing

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,820
deeply technical but it's a very fun
presentation I put some things together

22
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,539
that you maybe never thought about
before never looked at

23
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,810
and this way before so can keep that in
mind it's gonna be very fun and

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,000
lighthearted hopefully

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,969
funny in some parts and I guess the
start of the first thing would be to

26
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:26,969
define what is

27
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:30,329
electronic deduction and I made a nothin

28
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,710
important arm but it's basically looking
at

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,810
it can be anything from screenshots arm

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:41,539
content I guess would be the better word
focusing on content

31
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,750
and what kinda patterns or interesting
things can you find from something like

32
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,859
a screenshot

33
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,140
are something like meta-data inside the
files

34
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,939
I we could do a whole talk several hours
of talks on meta data were gonna touch

35
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:54,770
on a little bit that

36
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,200
second half but the first half hour
we're going to focus on looking at

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,030
screenshots

38
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,869
shoulder surfing things along those
lines what you can actually find out

39
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,299
probably a lot more than people may be
realize so

40
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,580
arm it is a former footprinting

41
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,920
if you look at it like that if your
shoulder surfing you're looking at

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,459
somebody's I'll

43
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:16,930
desk in their office you can find out
very quickly a look at someone's laptop

44
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,050
in here watch over your shoulder
everybody right you

45
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,090
I see looking over some a shoulder arm

46
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,040
see what kind of stuff they got
installed it tells a lot about who they

47
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
are as a user

48
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,659
on finding different patterns and
discovering software

49
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,420
that the use or or different web sites
so yes sounds pretty simple yet

50
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,040
it's common sense hacking us pop star
when the guys from our forums have been

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,470
a red dot com pam pam

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,620
%ah has referred to it in a very much as
is common sense hacking in your gonna

53
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,690
find out that it is something everybody
can do

54
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,090
but put a process to it up sitting down
and thinking

55
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,140
or what exactly does this mean sure I
see they've got

56
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,239
this application installed but was that
really me

57
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,110
so what if they've got something install
the level of depth is where comes into

58
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,730
play the depth of how much

59
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,819
experience you have how many software
packages you've seen

60
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,830
arm I've got some screenshots coming up
I've given this in a couple different

61
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,470
meetings

62
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,090
and every time I get someone points out
something new that I didn't even see

63
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,280
so it's all about the experience that
you have and what you recognize what you

64
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,720
put together the kinda come up with and
obviously VF physical access in time

65
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,930
available to sit there in

66
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,680
really pound away at you can find a
whole lot more that's when you can start

67
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,560
looking at meta data and things like
that

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,840
so yes this is very simple and I'll what
is the goal

69
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,010
love doing this well besides just being
funny kinda owning dropping the docs or

70
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,540
whatever you want to refer to it as

71
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,220
arm try to build a case think a bit you
know going to Batman won't pretend you

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,390
got utility belt

73
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,390
start putting all the stuff together
build a case like

74
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,810
I'm gonna prove that this laptop belongs
to this person

75
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,200
or arm if you want actual

76
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,340
truthful application when this might
come in handy if you do

77
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,879
get busted which hopefully nobody will
do that on

78
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:06,349
you can use these kinda things I say
look i cant use Microsoft Office because

79
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:07,189
I run Linux

80
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:11,189
or I can't use XYZ because I run that
you know you can use these things to say

81
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:11,780
listen

82
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,370
I can prove that's not a speech on my
computer because I don't have that

83
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,389
you know you can have that mister arm

84
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:22,850
but not have these individually will
stand on their own

85
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,180
they're all circumstantial evidence

86
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,080
you one thing I so don't think that this
is gonna stand up in court is some kinda

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,909
defense for anything

88
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,160
but you can build a case I love a
sequence of events and a lot of

89
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,630
different things that will prove that
something is or is not our or probably

90
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,840
as a probably is not you can never

91
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,650
also never come to 100 percent
conclusion but you can get pretty close

92
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,139
so coincidental evidence by itself is
useless so what if your

93
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,389
this person uses Microsoft Office sold
over one million other people

94
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:58,389
that doesn't really narrow it down or
prove anything

95
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,960
which there ago I guess again around her
okay

96
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,430
but building a collection of coins and
all evidence can help build

97
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,250
a case and and this is kinda overkill

98
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,400
but i wanna illustrated the kinda make
sure that the point gets across

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,340
is if you want actually chart this and
make this a process and security

100
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,030
field they like to make processes and
steps in stages and measure everything

101
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,220
which is

102
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,160
you know not exactly the hacker way to
do things but to visualize it

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,449
think are different types of users I
just made up of you here you know you

104
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:31,009
see

105
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:34,630
I hope you have a can see okay student
game or a home user

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,590
business user hacker just again made up
examples

107
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,910
and I just used a one to 10 scale
positive and negative starting in the

108
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,889
center

109
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,500
and based on what you might find on
someone's computer getting kinda build a

110
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,770
case for

111
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,780
one or the other user so for example

112
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,250
if you find a computer that has
accounting software

113
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,130
installed on it Microsoft Office outlook
as their client

114
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,310
are things like that that's going to
raise the percentage of the likelihood

115
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,630
of it being a business user

116
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,159
home users use some of those things too
so the students but a gamer

117
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,630
having an accounting software hacker
having accounting software

118
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,680
kinda lowers their probability so kinda
keep that

119
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,389
process in mind as you see some these
and think what kinda person this is what

120
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,729
kinda category my fall into

121
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:23,669
I said at the very beginning for those
who just came in this will be

122
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:25,680
interactive so I'm gonna be

123
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,340
and its it easy trust me it in in this
is a very simple nice example to start

124
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,400
with

125
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,099
first of all I mean what operating
system is this person using

126
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:40,449
commodity start the whole room windows
xp obviously we know that

127
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,479
well actually not necessarily course
people can scan things and it's

128
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,000
different when doing systems you can
trick people but that's pretty obviously

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,180
Windows XP we all can tell that

130
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,110
arm and you can tell kinda hardware
anybody really think about telling the

131
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,710
hardware from what you might see in

132
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,020
as simple as a task more when i'm
looking at a whole screen shower let me

133
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,150
just a taskbar

134
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,949
you know it's a laptop because you go so
you can put these things together

135
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,069
arm what else can you tell about in the
laptop is plugged in obviously

136
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:13,349
you see the AC power so it's plugged and
what about the speaker icon

137
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,979
you know such muted so

138
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,849
somebody muted their speakers that
doesn't happen accidentally

139
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,949
with isn't this a little things think
why would somebody

140
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:27,340
mute their speakers has got to be a
reason for that a game is not commute

141
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,660
their speakers

142
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,229
we kinda silly defeats the point right
there

143
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,568
this and this this man right here was
that no price

144
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:40,229
arm this screenshot I'll tell you was
from

145
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,460
other was this laptop on my other
laptops in an airport

146
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,830
and I didn't wanna disturb the people
around me and I didn't want to play my

147
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,930
vulgar language from minor revolution
radio tonight at eleven o'clock in this

148
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,409
room

149
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:55,270
be there me arm so yes this absence or
put this evening see how you can to

150
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,620
start with one thing kinda build up to
what it actually means

151
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,740
arm the software that's being using C
the icon in the center

152
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,389
everybody recognize that probably
Microsoft Outlook

153
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,610
what about the one next to it now this
is one of my favorite examples the one

154
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,720
right to the left of that

155
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,129
trillion what trillion not only is that
trillion

156
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,370
there's actually something else you can
pull out that little icon is more

157
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,210
information on that little icon believe
it or not

158
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,389
well I don't I honestly don't know that
that's I never heard that before that

159
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,659
that's a good one arm does anybody

160
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:36,419
isn't a very familiar with trillion
right here

161
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,610
trillion according to actually let me
back up yes if I back up

162
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,300
for those of you who don't know trillion
I'm assuming it but it does but let me

163
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,840
back up trillion is

164
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,800
a chat client that will communicate with
AOL messenger whatever their

165
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,050
things called MSN Messenger Yahoo
Messenger

166
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,130
its center is an all in one place

167
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,230
but the IKE right so there's to circles
there whatever that icon

168
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,210
if you're connected to all of the
available networks let's say you have an

169
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,830
AOL and MSN

170
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,620
Andy of if you're connected to all of
them both of those mobil's

171
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,330
light up yellow and this when you can
see that

172
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,120
only the top one is late which means
they're not connected to all a possible

173
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,290
networks they're available

174
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,719
what does that mean maybe nothing but
this is what we call building their case

175
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,430
building a preponderance

176
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,000
other evidence so many people actually
knew that the each little

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,780
icon is not just this is the software
using is actually a lot more information

178
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,550
and a lot of them so on anna & also

179
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,290
go outside on the icon says she and
other you can see the network icon is

180
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,290
showing

181
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,959
connected to a network somewhere
obviously you know it tells you a little

182
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,920
bit more

183
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,500
arm I'm sorry

184
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,070
were a actually very good point
absolutely and

185
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,530
again this is gonna fall under the might
be important might not be

186
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:59,530
but the time stamp the time stamp on
this was $3.37

187
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,740
or or what about think what about this
what if that time stamped in say 30

188
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,580
whether said

189
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,440
1537 somebody's doing military why
wouldn't you know

190
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
what kinda person would use military
time no just

191
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,130
just things like that some people might
some people I have reasons to do

192
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,160
arm so actually that's the least reagan

193
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,010
anybody in nosing come up to me
afterwards 337 has some significance to

194
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:26,170
us

195
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,449
not 1337 but 337

196
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:32,910
if you look on your phone keypad to
figure that out maybe

197
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,339
alright so first I can walk through this
one gonna come after a lot let everybody

198
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,510
play along with this

199
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,650
again for small operating system

200
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,510
Windows XP a go I'll can are ready sick

201
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,770
wireless network that's not connected

202
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:54,670
right rack

203
00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:01,670
it's running on battery power is not
plugged in good point yeah

204
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,250
well actually I'm gonna go with that is
not

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,090
what's wrong you're on the right track
or something else here that

206
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:14,890
that is actually and if anybody who is
very familiar with Dale

207
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,069
that's the application of ship with all
the bills for their built-in internal

208
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,550
car

209
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,580
and I purposely did this this is very
very

210
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,330
probably i'm looking see well on the
overhead out here but

211
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,450
you might notice that the wallpaper I
purposely clipped off from the wallpaper

212
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,760
that yeah guys can see but from the
wallpaper you can learn a lot as well

213
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,550
this is actually the default lol pic

214
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,300
this is a brand new I laptop I was
setting up for work

215
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,220
and if you know again if you're from
Iredell and lot of people roll them out

216
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,450
at their jobs or whatever you can
recognize

217
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:52,280
a lot of the Dell things come on with it

218
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,480
own apt say oh well just want to upgrade
the software that's a great one

219
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,590
the icon on the far left does that

220
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,210
now now building with our case that
we're building up your does that fall in

221
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,090
line with what I just said a new

222
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:09,060
laptop it's been pre-installed without
lock but they haven't activated it yet

223
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,750
so see were billing okay this is a new
laptop you know so you're getting a case

224
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,370
of exactly what kind user who the person

225
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,030
using this is pull out my

226
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:26,030
watchin I'm what other software you see
on-air

227
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,550
very obscure when that's gone anybody
else pick that one up

228
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,540
you know to download manager with the
goal of a download manager is

229
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,959
Download Manager and most cases and in
this case which helps build a profile of

230
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,090
this user

231
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,160
is if farm you're downloading something
on unstable network

232
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,140
and it crashes halfway through you don't
have to start all over again want to

233
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,949
automatically pick up where I left off

234
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,000
or you want to open up multiple channels
and try to pull it faster et cetera et

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,830
cetera

236
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,150
so what kinda person would need such a
thing

237
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:03,230
you know might be might be aware spa
piano could be arm

238
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,810
right there you got it I'll sit in my
this again is from my laptop or the

239
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,370
entire an hour putting that case
together the show's

240
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,720
this was from a laptop that are setting
up for work out sitting at home watching

241
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,600
TV

242
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,790
in my living room on my wireless and I
was downloading all the updates and

243
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,650
everything and i don't wanna lose that
when the first things I install on your

244
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:23,699
one other icon right there second one
from the left

245
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,890
again del they recognize the Dell that
comes with that's that damn annoying

246
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,290
del alert that you or I won't even

247
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:36,819
go into a rant on that thing arm sound
obviously the speakers

248
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,350
microsoft money came pre-installed as
well but if

249
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,220
we are you know this is a free install
system but money's kinda more indication

250
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,410
more the homies are wouldn't be

251
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,610
business as early as Microsoft Money
they're going to use a more professional

252
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,180
accounting package of some kind
microsoft money

253
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,340
could be a student may be something like
that but I mean out I've

254
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,630
I did this rumor Packers how many of you
have Microsoft Money in Salt

255
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,810
yeah so you can eliminate certain group
of people and that's again the point

256
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,000
up the whole presentation so the
conclusion already kinda told

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,090
again the timestamp in this case not a
whole lot of significance but it tells

258
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,800
you that what time I took

259
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,740
the screenshot obviously but yeah it's
pretty the cation

260
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,220
everybody sees all the evidence is there
what I describe this is me sitting there

261
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:27,220
installing a brand new computer

262
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:31,800
I for you out that's a temporary yes
that's absolutely

263
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,770
as absolutely good point in this case
was just temporary because I was playing

264
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,949
around with it in

265
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,990
but yeah I think says that can be easily
turned off and on

266
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,280
yet but it but it's absolutely 10 sings
you left

267
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,660
when I go back to the that slider sure
the beginning of making that case

268
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,420
that could be maybe a plus one or -1
kinda field all those go in that

269
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,650
direction to you get

270
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,730
get a good profile of where you're going
now this isn't just for

271
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,090
for them on taskbar obviously this can
be used for

272
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,750
anything you see on the screen and this
one again Windows XP

273
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,580
obviously but what programs the
sickening I know if you got to see that

274
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,440
especially maybe in the back

275
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,430
so maybe somebody up front can help us
out here but some programs on there that

276
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,260
maybe stand out as different like
microsoft office isn't exactly

277
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,260
different but for example you probably
see on here

278
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,610
power toys okay what kinda person has
power toys installed

279
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,970
no a power user up sometime that's not
something that

280
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,910
you know the the receptionist was gonna
have installed on your computer or

281
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,209
something like that

282
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,640
arm UCI I'll okay how about

283
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,870
nero 7 why would you have an assault if
you don't have a CD burner you just got

284
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,250
a clue about hardware from the software
once again

285
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,890
what does it mean again maybe nothing
but keepin' contact

286
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:51,150
arm iTunes UCI to user

287
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,319
possibly have an iPod

288
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,340
maybe

289
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:01,510
that's what I thats exact that was right
that was my trick question I've got it

290
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,380
in the notes here

291
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,650
that's a total red herring that's why
you wanna enumerate all of them don't

292
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,250
depend on any one thing

293
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,340
when you install that stupid dumb
QuickTime

294
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,770
it automatically puts that iTunes and
there now saucy that's a tricky one

295
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,810
night there

296
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:19,840
I love how about to let see what else I
don't spend too much time on it but

297
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,600
Tom palm thing in the bottom right

298
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,660
now as far as I know that doesn't
installed by default anything but it may

299
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,469
probably mean somebody has

300
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,470
some sort of palm device that they

301
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:37,040
use with their laptop

302
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,270
and and they obviously we know that that
comes with

303
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,910
arm Windows XP you can use the built-in
command line or

304
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,560
Internet Explorer or you know any
browser will support FTP but this person

305
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,680
went above and beyond

306
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,730
to get a doubt an FTP program for some
reason were

307
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,860
actually I'd never heard that that's a
good point yeah absolutely

308
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,210
absolutely because they're completely by
default order

309
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:06,020
course you can go in and alphabetize
them storm whatever began this case I

310
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,859
did not do that

311
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,180
s a very good point I didn't catch that
they've got

312
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,480
this person might be paranoid they've
got a couple anti-virus on their

313
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,329
I am

314
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,829
man got on all kinds of stuff

315
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,290
all me and you guys are so you don't you
guys can get the presentation you doing

316
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,280
great you name it

317
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,520
every one of these little things like

318
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,540
bowl on the desktop that's me move it
later put on the desktop for now

319
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,090
but not only that if and again I know
people can't read some the file names

320
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,310
but if you can look

321
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:47,679
you can see like the the at the very top
there's an mp3 file

322
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,310
at is even know that icon with its
associated with when I am

323
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,659
everybody recognizes that problem

324
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:03,660
gotta

325
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,140
maybe a that's actually

326
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,210
random in a randomly assigned to
something when you yeah so

327
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,210
on that could be anything arm look at
the

328
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,800
and again I know so we can see the
bombings but the file names on a couple

329
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,960
as mp3's

330
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,100
you may not recognize it DJ Snyder space
something there

331
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,890
some F bill F bill radio buddy

332
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,570
no may not know what that is from
looking at the screen shot but you can

333
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,120
go and search for later

334
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,190
on your search engine of choice we won't
mention the word whatever your search

335
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,180
engine of choice is

336
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,320
and find out and now you're building not
only profile the computer but even more

337
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,389
the person they're into this type of
music they listen to these particular

338
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,420
shows

339
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,590
what if now well

340
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,810
yeah that gives it later but I mean

341
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,990
I could make up a screen name with your
handle on it just as easily that's not

342
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:53,410
you know

343
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,730
well yeah i absolutely that so many
think summer more obvious than others

344
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:57,950
like that of course

345
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,390
I put another little man any stragglers
who knows the bottom right

346
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,930
I have a window open my taskbar the G
miss

347
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,110
in an art of deduction which is named
the presentation so

348
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,490
GG I that's not something that's
normally map by default allotted rise if

349
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,320
you're up to G

350
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,939
so this is probably on maybe in external
card or map to a drive on a network

351
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,800
somewhere

352
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,950
you know just little things now you've
built up someone who has network access

353
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,950
is a power user who has all these things
install

354
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,840
right absolutely

355
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,168
well like and I don't know this it may
be a little obscure but when those

356
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:41,929
explore

357
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:45,409
if you notice is on my anything above
that line

358
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:49,710
are you see those four things Mozilla
Firefox Thunderbird

359
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,539
Media Player and Windows Explorer 1064
doesn't go in there by the fall

360
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,999
so I went out of their way to put that
there so in my case

361
00:19:56,999 --> 00:19:59,739
Michael browse my files directly a lot
so I put that there but what if you

362
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:01,249
would have seen that accounting software

363
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:05,440
someone is using this almost exclusively
for they want a visa so much they're

364
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,350
gonna put it right up at the top or
doesn't mu

365
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:11,039
the ones below the line rotate based on
use so

366
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:18,039
a

367
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:25,840
and what kinda user might use notepad
well

368
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,869
and actually here's another thing I
didn't really think about what you guys

369
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,418
are given the idea is to is if you look
through a lot of these

370
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:35,419
applications you're saying quite a few
pieces of different shareware or

371
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:38,559
open-source offers of this person
obviously gets around knows how to

372
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,580
to get what they want so yeah I mean we
could we can sit here there's a ton you

373
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,570
see how this can build up and how fun in

374
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,090
putting all these things together so
we're gonna move on to a couple

375
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,668
others here about your browser window
we're gonna go we're gonna start going

376
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,259
through these lil bit more quickly cuz
you get everybody's obviously gotten the

377
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,080
point you guys would beat me again the
stuff I didn't find a 4-cell

378
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,699
so you guys probably got this down but
there's also some fun things in here

379
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,859
offer small the browser and operating
system that is being used we know some

380
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,249
browsers don't work on certain operating
system so that

381
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:14,249
helps isolate it but arm up

382
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:19,309
on on less on less

383
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,129
up unless they were purposely setting up
a screenshot for this presentation

384
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:31,129
com branded by

385
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,119
Comcast so we know what cable network
this person uses a cable modem

386
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:43,189
up man doesn't everybody have been Rev
on the toolbar

387
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:49,129
no not yet the Rev dot com check it out

388
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:52,249
you could download this presentation
from my sites thank all dot com

389
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:56,440
all the stuff that all the articles I've
had 2600 psi side note advertising

390
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,119
doctor opposite center center as I go
ahead yeah

391
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:05,639
Thomas squished

392
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:09,700
squished this all down

393
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,450
on here's a couple other little things
besides the AC the links in the plugins

394
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,039
are take a look at for example have yeah

395
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:22,859
you know wow that's a that's really good
yeah that's absolutely right

396
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,840
I notice how many okay so let's look at
the individual toolbars and this is

397
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,590
where at the very beginning I said the
more experience you have more things to

398
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,330
recognize

399
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,178
on the Google Toolbar if you have to
experience with it she's got the pop-up

400
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:35,690
blocker

401
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,340
and it's blocked a lot stuff sick of
myself

402
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,918
lotta stuff so they've had it all for a
while

403
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:46,019
you know this isn't a new computer for
somebody can say all know I just

404
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:46,649
installed

405
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:50,899
Ono you've had it for a while you know
that you're going to Lotte prawn site

406
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:51,720
with pop

407
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I that's not me though that or

408
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:07,799
their paranoid up %uh spire and i were
absolutely on

409
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,519
look over on the far right-hand side of
the Google toolbar use the snag it

410
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:15,960
does anybody know what Snagit software
screen capturing software

411
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,599
so this person has a reason to do that
maybe make screen captures a videos

412
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,470
recordings for something like I don't
know act TV .org

413
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,690
him why I'm gonna for up published
leaving

414
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,619
I am arm product place at that sort of
stuff struggling for the word there

415
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:35,379
product placement the awful toolbar
actually gives you a little bit more

416
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:39,409
arm focus target this is actually some
useful stuff here

417
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:42,419
if you and again this experience you
know what comes with the fault with the

418
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:43,330
Yahoo Toolbar

419
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,869
by the fall with Yahoo it doesn't put
these things over here are like fantasy

420
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:47,720
sports

421
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:52,279
this user isn't a fantasy sports for
some reason and that kinda narrows it

422
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,269
down to a lot of people specially
hackers

423
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:57,470
my the only fantasy sports here in
hacking community

424
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:01,249
okay one more so that narrows it down a
lot as well so

425
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:05,519
again a lot of arm a lot of stuff as a
couple more obscure ones just for the

426
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:06,859
heck up at the very top

427
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:10,369
arm there's you see the the

428
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:14,149
passionately to point that very top
they're the ones on the far right

429
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:18,269
I looks like the AOL my icon guy there
and as a couple other between as anybody

430
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,820
recognize those

431
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,389
yeah they probably up they've got MSN on
their the low dollar sign

432
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,149
right there Party Poker now

433
00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:33,210
so this is somebody who's online playing
poker

434
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,429
which in that narrows it down yeah and
well you know an input now that we've

435
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:40,690
got this big footprint now let's step
back again let's do the analysis part

436
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,889
we can cut it so what type of user is
but we've got enough in just this one

437
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,619
to really pinpoint we know this person
is has a yahoo account

438
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:52,389
because I got ya into what they probably
got a Google account maybe not not

439
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:55,889
are required for the pool to I don't
think anybody correct me on that

440
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:59,159
okay but you'd for the Yahoo account for
you to have your

441
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,789
those custom links and stuff in there
you have to have a yahoo account for

442
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:02,330
that

443
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,589
so you put all that together you know
they've got a party poker account they

444
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:06,908
play party polka dot net

445
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:10,759
XIV all of these things you really
pinpoint it down if you're a

446
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,859
are detective trying to find this for
real trying to pinpoint

447
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,970
get the information from Party Poker
fine from ya who put it all together

448
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,339
you're not going to get your free

449
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:26,339
pretty good handful of people

450
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:33,879
yeah that's so you gotta give me all
kinds every time I get that this

451
00:25:33,879 --> 00:25:40,879
so much that no you know it's great I
keep coming keep uncommon

452
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,320
thank you I

453
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,639
alright so again

454
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,540
this is another one Tom very quickly
through this because I see how much time

455
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,100
here

456
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,940
nor worker arm very quickly for this one

457
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,960
different browser but still looks like
Windows XP

458
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,190
using Firefox Eva says most Firefox on
arm

459
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,480
again Lotus the links you see the been
traveling on their

460
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,510
arm there's a couple other interesting
things and these links

461
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,640
now we're getting very precise a very
detailed I want every back up and think

462
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,350
of the overview that you're looking

463
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:34,790
for specific things that you can build
their case on and they were

464
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,920
using examples to illustrate them arm
IMDB

465
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,050
that's an interesting link to have on
they have three different search engines

466
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,210
that someone

467
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:47,200
who doesn't have any allegiance to one
particular search engine

468
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,800
the big G somebody who actually wants to
mix up their searches for whatever

469
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,230
reason

470
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:57,540
arm tiny or else an interesting thing to
have arm

471
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,680
how about list this to on here that are
really

472
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,220
the very next witnesses post to
mainstream does anybody here

473
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,110
for me with mean streams good friend of
mine de CS

474
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,430
and I rattle run a site name streams
which is a arm

475
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,570
social bookmarking site kinda like
Slashdot

476
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,570
things on those lines are based on the
medics engine

477
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,000
arm but that's a post to

478
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,970
I can go to a web page that I find
interesting and click that button that's

479
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,280
a little JavaScript ap lit that will
post

480
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,530
that injury to my particular blog on the
site so

481
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:33,899
this person must have on the extremes
account we've narrowed it down quite a

482
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,800
bit once again

483
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,240
and a/c way back machine than

484
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,280
the very last one assist press it does
anybody recognize

485
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,430
that I'm hoping somebody will get this
one press it

486
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,430
who said that

487
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,590
WordPress there we go Word Press

488
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,050
that is same thing if you it's a little
job thing that will post

489
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:59,820
and it read your blog and you're not
voting interest

490
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:03,649
other people's blogs are you well I
guess in some cases you can but mostly

491
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:04,950
your posting your own blog

492
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,470
so it says right there digital doll cut
off or whatever so

493
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,310
that's my site a pretty but this one
pretty much nails it down to who it is

494
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:20,310
again

495
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,360
right and if you know the stumble upon
toolbar

496
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,520
when you do go to our site you can post
comments and things like that

497
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,629
if it's a site you've been to an add a
comment the entries on that will change

498
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,200
the colors will change in your you know
that this person has been to this

499
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,360
particular site before

500
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,930
right right and this case yet this was

501
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,180
just put on again for the screenshot so
arm

502
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,800
yeah

503
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,920
yeah absolutely Sangha Gogoi Gmail com

504
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,530
anybody care arm are

505
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:10,750
again to briefly go through this one IRC
ever is getting the point some really

506
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,240
nice speed up to a couple more these

507
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,820
arm you know they're using what client
using work obviously

508
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,409
but you can see in that screenshot you
can tell what username I was using

509
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,690
I was logged in as so this is more like
shoulder surfing you want to find out

510
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:26,710
with our login as he so-and-so is that's
also what I do

511
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,080
they see the username you can see what
downed server they're connected to this

512
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,710
is our

513
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,270
in red saree see what channel they ran I
just chop this office is pretty

514
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,560
self-explanatory

515
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,450
what user names anything else like that
you get a time stamp on this

516
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,920
as well depending on what the topic as
you see the topic the channel is

517
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,080
been Rev radio 134 this Tuesday so

518
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,179
134 with Mark Spencer white what time
frame was that that was

519
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:54,680
you know what we're gonna be doing 157
tonight at eleven o'clock so

520
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,530
you know twenty some episodes ago sing
at a time frame exactly when the

521
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,820
screenshot was taken as well

522
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,450
up

523
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,450
90more is the messenger clients

524
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,520
I this is these are just reply from the
first um

525
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,650
first Google Image Search all these and
look at all the plane user names people

526
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,700
take screenshots

527
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,870
when I can harass anyone these people if
I want to be a jerk I mean

528
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,780
they're posting their usernames all
their list of all their bodies you know

529
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,350
let's

530
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,000
think oh well you know the bad things
can happen when are you going person a

531
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,110
Denny's people can pretend to be on a
friend of so-and-so yeah

532
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,360
you know Center could be dangerous to to
have someone that kinda stuff

533
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:39,360
out there but you can learn a lot of
from it I do that

534
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:15,529
Ste just

535
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:22,529
just saw

536
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:33,429
check check check costs Ste

537
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:28,000
physical access to some other files

538
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,080
any better when I have to eat the thing
hello

539
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,100
check check you better get

540
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,930
I am so what's actually got physical
access to some the files even if

541
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,340
for temporarily getting access crabs
them off

542
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,490
well you look at the Med and again
people

543
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,390
probably know about meta-data skim
through this quickly but meta data is

544
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:49,050
actually

545
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,790
data about data that's the Wikipedia
definition I think it's a great

546
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,800
definition very simple and to the point

547
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,300
data about data so what kinda files use
meta data

548
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:02,940
image files document files music could
be anything really

549
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,320
arm it's all in the file specifications
and what the file

550
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,300
contains arm and what kinda data to the
attached for example id3 i think is a

551
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,840
great example this because

552
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:17,040
you to put the author the title on the
genre all these other there's a lot of

553
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,430
stuff and

554
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,880
id3 tag that's a former meditate its
data about

555
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,980
the rest of the day about that mp3 file
so

556
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,930
meta data can be really really cool XML
is the rocks or is awesome it's a great

557
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,600
way to

558
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,940
export and import data arm

559
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,980
and here's a really good example this is
a fun story this is my

560
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,720
to the trends manassas and Virgil who

561
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,830
mom did a presentation at inches onto

562
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,280
a couple years back the blackboard case
where they present a simple abilities in

563
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,389
Blackboard software

564
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,540
and you can go do the research on an
hour it probably would be to end up

565
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,600
going to hear but

566
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,840
basically they gotta cease and desist
because black or didn't want this

567
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,030
information released

568
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:59,940
well the cease and desist was sent in
Microsoft Word format

569
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,040
so I took the file this was several
years ago so they I took the file

570
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:09,150
I open it up when I see this comment in
there nothing they can read a bliss says

571
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,700
on this section gets us nowhere airing
our dirty laundry and this supports the

572
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,750
notion that we picked onto kids they
don't have spelchek they can stop it

573
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:17,139
right

574
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,819
we claim things and they denied way to
embed

575
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,310
embarrassing stuff in there and I have
the exit or not we will call an XML as

576
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,830
Microsoft bastardized

577
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,199
XML we won't go there on to show that
that's actually embedded

578
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,580
in that data and I can't go in there and
look at the properties of that document

579
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,100
file I can tell the author

580
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,339
this was the second revision so probably
secretary type that handed

581
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,960
lawyer he and his all comments and then
made a fool themselves until the company

582
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,409
name

583
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:49,799
hope they don't come after me now
because that arm fight is public

584
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,120
information is out there on Google you
find it anywhere

585
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,929
tells the date that is created they
can't deny that they didn't say this

586
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,279
they can't deny that this is a file from
them it's

587
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,370
it's right there in plain text in its
not really much they can say to deny it

588
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:05,750
true

589
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,140
sure you can artificially change meta
data but

590
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:13,279
you can get into deeper levels a
forensics to prove

591
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,650
real actual dates and things like that
that's totally

592
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,970
could be a whole presentation in other
itself

593
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:26,970
but its pretty damning evidence will put
it like that

594
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:44,020
great

595
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:54,630
even if you don't turn trains tracking
you everything is on

596
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,120
every time you pass something back and
forth Microsoft logging all that stuff

597
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,270
Microsoft Office

598
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,830
doc format or whatever well terminology
just explain

599
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,029
but it logs all that stuff here's a neat
little trick if you ever find

600
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,690
I found this is someone at work on time
before the had this follows about three

601
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,720
or four pages long but I was 10 megs

602
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,360
minor asking my sis pile so big it's
only couple pages long

603
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,940
so copy and paste that text output and
new files in a backyard is to clean up

604
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,440
and then I

605
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:23,790
you know look to see what's really in
the file is taking up the stand next

606
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,820
business day it's not

607
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,330
you know its all these undue is an all
these iterations of stuff them

608
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:32,520
past self a lotta stuff that's kept
captain

609
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,490
in the document and there are tools out
there if you're worried or concerned

610
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:38,190
about that he's always go through this
tools you can download I think even

611
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,070
Microsoft KB

612
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,000
made one they will strip a lot at midday
out for you for privacy reasons

613
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,870
but see X if properties

614
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:50,109
in Windows XP the screenshot we have
here meta-data

615
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:54,540
in photos again building a case on gonna
spend too much time on this but you can

616
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,980
see

617
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:59,150
the equipment make arm stamped in there
by default the camera model:

618
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:04,550
that's the type of camera the person you
so if you someone can claim they didn't

619
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,440
take this picture

620
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,640
that picture you got some nasty prawn in
the compound in on your doors and

621
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,580
you're not going to say you can take it
if you got the camera model is stated

622
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,520
its timestamp

623
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,250
notice at the bottom there's author and
keywords those optional

624
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:20,870
but if somebody actually put those in
and seated with their camera it's gonna

625
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,350
stamp that in there as well

626
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,720
really damn yourself but the other funny
thing out a throw this out I'm not gonna

627
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,830
given examples of this but another funny
thing I did find some

628
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,180
you go to someone site and find

629
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,089
they've got pictures of their vacation
and the kids sledding in the winter and

630
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:39,870
smiles

631
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:44,020
and then somewhere else they've got
those private pictures with their wife

632
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:47,100
that they put on some site that in think
anybody ever find but

633
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,770
coming from the same time frame same
camera type same author tagged in there

634
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,730
you get yourself in some embarrassing
situations so

635
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,410
again daytime pinpoint some the general
say again circumstantial evidence

636
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,290
but never give them any more information
and this is something that I

637
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,509
talk about the usual at never
voluntarily get more information than

638
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,100
you have to

639
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,529
those things are blank by default don't
put in your offer name what would you

640
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,000
really have a reason to unless you're a
professional photography

641
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,510
copyrighted or something like that by
you should be

642
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,090
making Creative Commons I here's one
example that I made up on one other

643
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,660
thing that's kept in phnom

644
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,450
in meta data is thumbnails sometime so

645
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:30,910
on this a good example my very good
friend along who

646
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:34,609
come bump into here in a week or two our
good friend along for this is a picture

647
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,990
of her from Freaknik

648
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,090
conference on the southeast thumbnail
love the image now you see the image

649
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,990
name up there's

650
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:44,550
I am g0 10 2001 details

651
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,960
all of the properties of that image well

652
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,480
noticed that thumbnail in the bottom
right corner that's embedded

653
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,030
in the meta data that is part love the
image okay

654
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,450
now we're gonna go to the next screen I
open this up and I edited

655
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,370
and I my graphic skills are the socks or
so all I could to

656
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,450
was tight the big white box over this as
we love a la ca

657
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,780
arm but I did say that that is an added
that to change the picture

658
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,570
the thumbnail does not get updated
specially older applications it does not

659
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,210
update them

660
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:18,830
and updates new versions of Photoshop
added that feature in there

661
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,580
when they realize what was happening and
everyone

662
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:28,970
in the room above 18 is a famous example
Aug 02 actually I do

663
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,290
how to find the data native support in
the OS

664
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:35,540
so you saw some screenshots I was doing
we're just right click on Properties

665
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,610
or application specific like id3 tags
and there are several tools out there

666
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,210
there's these Java libraries yes I want
to do from the program inside things are

667
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:43,830
some other

668
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,270
tools you can download arm or you can
actually go in and fix

669
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,710
and it the data itself and you'll see
earlier you saw the

670
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:56,970
sickening back you saw the camera name
their eastman-kodak et cetera

671
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,800
CX 7430 you have to use the properties
are the limits the operating system over

672
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,120
nothing up in hex editor

673
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,259
hex editor of choice and you can
actually see the data they see the

674
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,070
bottom says Eastman Kodak Company

675
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:11,490
it's in love a different format you got
the end of line markers in

676
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:14,730
control characters and things like that
in there but you can see that data

677
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:18,240
so yes catch Schwartz famous example of
this

678
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,010
cast I didn't know this was to be honest
because I didn't have cable

679
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:26,660
but apparently this was a host of tech
TV show some tech TV show

680
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,020
and she put these two pictures up on her
page

681
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,870
and you know looking also tree in
seductive

682
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,810
all that good stuff and you know should
you be worried about something like this

683
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,920
well

684
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,820
these are private pictures and as I said
earlier there's a thumbnail that's kept

685
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:47,050
in those images so even with you edit it
like for example you only want to show

686
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,940
off the eyes or something like that

687
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,390
and forget to update that I had to edit

688
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,650
I had to edit the naughty bits because I
didn't know United wanna get in each

689
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,640
other or

690
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,569
but you know she's a little grainy
because these were

691
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,900
for me it worse X expressed expanded on
with the proper term would be that

692
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,540
they were pulled out of some now so
they're not as high quality other

693
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,330
pictures

694
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,490
but yeah you trim those pictures and
don't do the update and yet you can

695
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:15,590
get yourself in an embarrassing
situation question is nothing to be

696
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,180
embarrassed about

697
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,210
yes me but will go on from there

698
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,300
um or what else Luciana speed-up

699
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:27,150
wanna miss anything arm Microsoft this
is another great example of my favorite

700
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,220
examples

701
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:32,240
arm Microsoft busted in piracy

702
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,720
they had an excuse but will we'll get to
that in a second and you can open it up

703
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,010
right while I talk a few emails using XP
can open up right now there's a path at

704
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,060
the bottom

705
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,110
you can browse so that and look at these
files and you will see it on

706
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,640
your laptops right now you can have
evidence that this on

707
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,379
this is one of the wave files when their
sound files in the help

708
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,360
and you go into the way file to hex edit
on you see the salt agar very and

709
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,620
and some love you might not recognize it
is kinda obscure but deep zone

710
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,799
I S ft Sound Forge 4.5 we know any
program that used to create these way

711
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,720
files it was

712
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,160
Sound Forge version 4.5 but the

713
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,270
key here is the word deep zone

714
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,320
deep zone is the name of a cracker this
is a cracked version if

715
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,330
a sound forge 4.5 minutes in every copy

716
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:24,520
a Windows XP so Microsoft excuse was we
outsource the sound production to

717
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,730
another company we didn't do that

718
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:31,290
but they can't tonight they can say no
we did you gated

719
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,480
so when he did the crack it would at
that to the files

720
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,620
so here's the last example so the first
two were kinda funny that

721
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:41,040
more serious all the more scary and all
that maybe more close to home for some

722
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:41,770
people

723
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,850
in this is great because it's a fairly
recent example on

724
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,529
keep in mind the legalities especially
for defense it was an interview in the

725
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,610
washington post as you see dated there
you can

726
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,180
certainly reference this in and verify
that it's all true

727
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,169
on and it had well they did in an
interview with this guy

728
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,240
I don't know how you pronounce his name
0 as 0x 80 of 80 of city

729
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,700
whatever and Dom didn't interview with
him

730
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,370
and it had IPTC information IPTC is
another former meditate it's an optional

731
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:12,150
former meta-data

732
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,280
shoes by The Associated Press

733
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,400
because they have these giant databases
all these photos the stock photos at the

734
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,740
use for their stories

735
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,740
and the mix them all up well

736
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:28,520
they all this optional extra data into
their photos

737
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,590
so they're doing and story on this

738
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,990
0 by eighty guy who was running by

739
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:38,670
nets bragging about how many millions of
dollars he made from scamming people out

740
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:39,730
of money

741
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,930
all the straw that he's committed in an
interview and kept him truly all this

742
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:44,600
anonymous tough

743
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,100
all but they have accidentally put the
city and the state

744
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,720
in the IPTC information saw okay we'll

745
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,980
okay fine narrowed it down to a CD
Universe New York City

746
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,630
you know from this is Roland Oklahoma

747
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,590
self little bit more extra research
again

748
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,370
utility bills go Batman on national on
this was

749
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,609
detective work from people on Slashdot
on the article itself gives you a lot of

750
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:11,550
clues

751
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:14,880
you know that this person was 21 years
old that he had blonde hair covering his

752
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,110
eyebrow City skinny et cetera et cetera

753
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:20,530
nearly down physically quite a bit you
know the smokes and even for for is

754
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,170
morally

755
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:25,380
you know get details on the story in a

people dropped out you know

760
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,270
you know in a lil customer seven years
ago sorry about that

761
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:46,370
and the even says that you lose your
used car lot a gas station convenience

762
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,190
store in a strip club

763
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:52,230
well you take that a step further mix
all that together

764
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,140
well fact role in oklahoma has a total
population of around 3,000 people

765
00:44:57,140 --> 00:45:00,940
3,000 already narrowed it down to member
preponderance of evidence to build down

766
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,500
a narrow down to find the person you're
looking for

767
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,800
probably twenty the role in our mold row
high school the only two high schools in

768
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,760
the area

769
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,070
you know pretty pretty straight for that
that's going to be

770
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:14,550
pretty accurate city data dot com
reports there were only about 40 people

771
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,750
in that town

772
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,120
that were that age in the year two
thousand little math and Mac

773
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,220
to got wage was in 2000 only about 40
people

774
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:27,400
down to forty possible people now and
the fact that he told where he lives

775
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,560
Google Maps will give you the court
instead he somewhere between that strip

776
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,279
club

777
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,260
their convenience store and that used
car lot somewhere those coordinates

778
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,010
and you can actually go and google map
the whole thing

779
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,980
cell kinda scary that here you are
giving an anonymous interview

780
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:46,000
in this presentation is that haven't
done it hope in the passage definitely

check out about

782
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,680
how to talk to media be careful you
don't give them stuff like this and

783
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,470

PowerPoint PowerPoint every summer arm
obvious if I use PowerPoint

793
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,880

keeping all that animate or as we went
along but I gave you a lot of

798
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,200
information about me just from

802
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,040
me just from this

803
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:55,290

presentation in this is this is to
everybody

813
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,310
this presentation that very first

814
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:30,620
image that use of the little taskbar was
me

815
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,710
flying for work and I look to my task

816
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:38,480
think downey like I wanna fight guys at
my meeting with recognize that

817
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,800

818
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,710
screenshot

819
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,970
like on its Kenny don't know what else
we can come up with so I went to the

820
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:49,240
meeting thinking all this just be a
silly little side note in we all started

821
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,090
looking around why what else cool if I
will sacrifice actually put together

822
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,690
several other screenshots

823
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,840
put it together into a fifteen minute
thing now we've got a full presentation

824
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,250
looking meta-data

825
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:02,030
all the information that you can find
out again I made up the term electronic

826
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,820
deduction but it seems fitting

827
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:07,210
have all the stuff any %uh view even
these little things that you find

828
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:07,710
interesting

829
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:11,250
other people can find interesting if I
know this is kinda finally did make

830
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,620
learn anything from this is a lot of new
stuff in your right I mean is nothing

831
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,230
that was above anyone's head

832
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:18,670
you know it's all stuff that you know
before becoming putting it together in

833
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:19,750
such a way

834
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:22,820
that it's like wow thats that's kinda
cool that I can isolate site

835
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,210
stuff like that so your gifts give
presentations at your local been

836
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,500
meetings at your local 2600 meetings
whatever you make whatever you call it

837
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,550
doesn't matter

838
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:33,700
meeting with people making all
presentations you never know what you

839
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,090

stairway from the spinning monkey the

842
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,120

minutes left so I'd be happy to

846
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,840
I'm sorry arm that was actually of love
your blog was

847
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:05,840
no such

848
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:19,420
shop thank you and I bring in bring that
checkered

849
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,570
look if you open up the chip pecan added
plus

850
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,730
which i think you're using to look at
the source

851
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:28,850
a Photoshop also put in some doubt about

852
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,950
I'm pretty sure there's a time in there
when it was edited and then that

853
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:35,720
original exist at it was still there
when the photo was taken

854
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,930
so you can also check for photo
manipulations way

855
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:42,609
if new some saved in

856
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,560
things get deep yeah you will also put a
you know metadata

857
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,720
said what's after with

858
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:56,670
another way of checking so to speak

859
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,590
you said I was there was ways of telling
if somebody was messing with the

860
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:00,460
meta-data

861
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,600
if somebody is like except writer or
something like that

862
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,840
uuuu minutes his ways that you could
kinda prove that how would you do that

863
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,330
you can change that's really while

864
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,110
talk afterwards because you get into a
lot it's not my expertise

865
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,810
but there are forensics things that can
go through their mostly what he's

866
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,570
describing

867
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:23,810
what I was thinking up was just going
back in there in a racist like describe

868
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,440
the Microsoft document

869
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,640
keeps a lot of stuff in there but their
applications custom

870
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,529
custom design that will do that they
sell law enforcement security and stuff

871
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:33,130
like that

872
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:37,060
rip it out or like he said plus is what
I use

873
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,820
good is a presentation on those tools

874
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:44,480
Sunday is presentation on those tools
and a

875
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,560
great comebacks what

876
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:53,060
also tonight for some people came and
your toys

877
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,640
tonight eleven o'clock find a revolution
radio season 4 episode number one

878
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,589
come back have some more fun probably be
a lot more colorful language is that

879
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,950
when this was love it more low-key

880
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,320
at some point across for that and

881
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:12,320
black racks doing freaking 101 tomorrow
at twelve o'clock

882
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,170
in this very room make check that out

883
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,300
I was gonna expand upon that point about
the forensics basically

884
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,420
what you do is you back in new track
with the computer dippers and use you

885
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,700
look at file access times file free
eight times

886
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:30,140
use access to our network you get that
data on

887
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,730
the servers and that as far as the
frenzy tracking

888
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:37,810
annex this

889
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:41,240
I don't like the way microsoft does that
turn tracking on

890
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,380
its tracking anyway you know this is
kinda like this way to say oh yeah

891
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,580
to make it easier for you to follow
other people's but is keeping a lot

892
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,920
all data on its own anyway and

893
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,030
yak of yourself anyway

894
00:51:55,030 --> 00:52:02,000
thank you very much short notice yes

895
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,080
original one is cancelled that was
supposed to be

896
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,140
yes has been cancelled but there is
still a police station

897
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,109
12:30 tonight after shows come back and
check it out thanks again for your
