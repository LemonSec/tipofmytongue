1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,989
events right serve it in the context of

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:08,060
emergency communications which it's out
it's very useful for

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,240
on between a 911 the northeast blackout
now those events

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,710
are all good examples love a

5
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,760
relying on amateur radio to sustain
communications

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,949
in conditions where other
infrastructures are unavailable so

7
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:25,380
that's probably the context in which
most people hear about it because that

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,410
gets the news coverage

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,320
but I'ma to radio is a SEC service

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,300
that I is available to anyone who

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,260
can pass the exam which is very simple
at this point and a and just play around

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:39,600
it

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,850
it's it's really more of a hobby than
anything else Anders levels

14
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,010
there's levels to the licensing the the
most basic license right now is the

15
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,449
technician class which is a no code
licenses are not required to learn any

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,299
more scope which used to be a stumbling
block for some people

17
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,869
up recently the amateur radio is
completely restructured in that there's

18
00:00:58,869 --> 00:00:59,449
now only

19
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,190
I guess essentially three licenses
there's technician class

20
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,130
general class an extra class what you
get

21
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:12,039
with a technician class is probably 99
percent what anything

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,710
a geeky person would wanna play with a
on the radio

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,390
the only thing you really don't get is
access to what's called the HF and

24
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,720
traditionally known as shortwave bands
frequencies below 29 megahertz

25
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:29,970
down there's a lot of other interesting
stuff and to get access to that

26
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,929
right now you still have to pass a code
test within the year that'll probably go

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,570
away

28
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:39,910
up but the general class gives you an
initial access to the

29
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,960
HF frequencies the extra class kyushu

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,460
an extra chunk of those HF frequencies
that's probably all you need to know to

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,250
get started

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,159
tech license is the entry key and a its

33
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,980
relatively easy to get as they were
saying before we started a

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,830
right now the FCC is produced a question
for the three hundred questions

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:05,620
%uh you only have to take that 35 what
question multiple choice test and you

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,940
only have the past twenty one of those
questions

37
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,379
and you're there and that the
opportunity to actually take that test

38
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,280
is going to be presented tomorrow

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,400
up and some of the other members in the
group will be able to talk more about

40
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,819
the details that but we will have
testing here at the conference

41
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,790
and I wanted to work explain to people
who are here not very technical

42
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,030
that a I

43
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:32,469
día radio spectrum is really yeah

44
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,620
the radio spectrum is a pretty broad

45
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,019
arm most people additional year with the
frequencies that

46
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:42,769
maybe they watch television a ha over
the air or

47
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:47,239
or listen FM radio or AM radio on all
these are really come so they've

48
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,489
electromagnetic spectrum and this is a a
chart showing at

49
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:54,779
most to the useful I Electromatic

50
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:59,109
spectrum as got chopped up an allocated
by the United States government

51
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,969
and you'll see all these colored blocks
their

52
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:06,608
and it's really a crazy patchwork will a
frequencies

53
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:10,230
um falling all the Inbox up there

54
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:14,819
are all broadcast blocks so for example
the big one on the second row is the AM

55
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,659
broadcast

56
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,418
block great st. location that you would
find a if you're turning around her and

57
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:20,359
broadcast radio

58
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:23,650
a couple the other ones on the fourth
line down are

59
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,579
television FM stations and also FM radio
stations just to give you an idea of

60
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,760
where things are located here in our
coasts

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,138
in fact let's let's point which is a
couple is a commentaries on this

62
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,480
it's kinda like a time line %ah when can
you point to like the year

63
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,599
the AM radio band yet now

64
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,709
keep in mind one thing is it from

65
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,269
not a hundred percent to scale

66
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,129
so don't I mean I i I the the broadcast
people have

67
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:54,590
a lot of spectrum but the one thing when
you look at this is that it makes it

68
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,510
look like they have of

69
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,779
a particularly in the AM broadcast band
this is not

70
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:02,769
that incredibly wide but here you go i
mean that standard broadcasting a.m.

71
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,930
the scales become more compressed as you
go

72
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,699
died down each row just because it how
much bandwidth you have on each

73
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,540
on each row theirself this goes from DC
all the way up to like 300 gigahertz

74
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,370
right so

75
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,899
right has you have I'll you have a
difference in scale from the first row

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,820
to the last girl to get CDM the AM radio
band which is

77
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,040
more accurate is the medium wave and is
a

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,660
near the bottom discharge me load
frequency to round 1 megahertz

79
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,500
and Lincoln is give up to the FM
broadcast band I just I'm just giving

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:32,870
these

81
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,000
these vance's examples because they're
the ones in people from laypeople

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,790
emotional your with

83
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,110
on kiss him people listen to radio

84
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,390
good one of the things that makes ham
radio fun

85
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:49,610
is that we don't need as much bandwidth
does the broadcasters to do our thing

86
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:53,400
whereas up broadcast signal just

87
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,790
say maybe has to be that wide to is a
very

88
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,270
course Wales showing it we only need
that much

89
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,440
we can now we can get by with as little
as $250 hurts and still get a signal of

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,830
two other people

91
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,690
a we have to use specialized techniques
%uh we have to learn specialized skills

92
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,760
but that's what makes it good %uh we
don't need

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,950
up either the the the band with where
the power

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,539
up it's possible the amateur radio
talked anywhere on the planet

95
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:27,990
was less than 1 watt compare that to
them megawatts than FM broadcaster Mike

96
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,360
and also to clarify the diffident death
differences between terms

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,660
broadcasting and transmitting
broadcasting a

98
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,920
by definition means for transmitting a
signal and you don't have a particular

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,010
I individual in mind for receiving it

100
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,190
broadcasters like freest commercial
radio station

101
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,260
they just broadcast in whoever listens
to is great maze people possible

102
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,820
as opposed to non-broadcast which it
would be everything we're really talking

103
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,010
about here today

104
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,789
which you have a specific individual or
group of individuals

105
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,090
you're communicating two ways with a
back-and-forth

106
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,350
so I none of the things that I will be
discussed it really that broadcasting

107
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,150
their about

108
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,810
transmitting and you cannot broadcast as
an amateur radio operator or

109
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,200
any that the services were talking about
you can't transmit with a specific

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,050
audience

111
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,140
specific recipient in mind there's

112
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,180
there's a couple of very in a row
exceptions within that but

113
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,380
that is the absolute general rule and in
still your target

114
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,460
your target audience or your target is
amatures

115
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,740
now when you're talking about amateur
radio um but I just wanted to point out

116
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,060
a couple things you you know you see
this big job lock up a lot of blue stuff

117
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,930
but you also see a pretty good chance
for the green stuff which is amateur

118
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,580
%uh in here and the you know sometimes
they popped right up against the

119
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,469
broadcasting but it it a lot of people
are kinda blown away by the fact that

120
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,740
um FM radio and abuts upright against TV

121
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,500
his their channelized in in with an FM
radio

122
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,270
four AM radio you get a frequency within
TV get a channel and

123
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,630
a lot of people don't put it together so
when you look on here you come to get an

124
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,230
idea

125
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,540
where up where things lie

126
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,200
hand %ah you know what's next to each
other

127
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,180
but you getting down here you get into
some interesting things that are

128
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,920
overlapping

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,030
where there's a lot of sharing we'll
talk about that a little bit

130
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:24,760
can you point out Lina some other
frequencies people here most familiar

131
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,920
with like a

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,410
a cellular telephone NPCs frequencies
other

133
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,270
typically around a hundred maker 800 900
megahertz band into the nineteen hundred

134
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,510
megahertz band

135
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,800
much gonna point out where where those
frequencies land spectrum

136
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,880
know it's an RTS in fine print here but
its

137
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,260
it's just a huge resource available to
the public the electromagnetic spectrum

138
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,300
so to give you an idea and the next
almost every champ above broadcasts

139
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,920
up bandwidth available there's almost
always adjacent chump somewhere in the

140
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,780
vicinity for

141
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,610
amateur radios to use so every type
propagation that you would get with the

142
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:03,120
shortwave bands with the show is
broadcast bannister

143
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,450
the station's you can hear from Europe
and the medium weight band and the FM

144
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,210
band

145
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,310
you can also get with amateur radio
assuming you choose to join us

146
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,190
which we hope you do a one of the things
you've you'll find discussed amongst

147
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,340
amatures is

148
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,670
is frequency access a frequency control

149
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,980
there's a political end to that there
are some of our frequencies

150
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,280
that are covered it if you follow
anything in broadcast news or anything

151
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,300
and commercial radio news

152
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,039
a that the FCC essentially cells

153
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,110
frequencies to commercial entities and
they make money on that

154
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,360
and whenever there's money on the table
things get interesting

155
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,000
%uh so so every now and again some FM
some

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,830
amateur radio frequencies look like
they're on the block

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,120
the biggest protection we have against
the government

158
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,610
taking those away is our use

159
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:59,150
and our uses those responses for for
good purposes

160
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,500
member gency communications a so

161
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,570
keep in mind that when you enter into
this a

162
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,470
don't just get your license get on the
air %uh if the hell it's very helpful to

163
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:09,940
the

164
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,050
the overall causes keeping the
frequencies that we have

165
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:17,790
it in I'm pointing up here too 5254
megahertz which

166
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,980
um I is commonly referred to as six
meters

167
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:25,590
up cuz thats approximately the
wavelength in GC it comes right up

168
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,480
against

169
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,850
channel two 34 well

170
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,890
TV channel she's evil channels 234

171
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,029
and you'll notice that there's no
channel one

172
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,330
well guess what it was right here

173
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,029
and channel 0 was right here and other
parts of the world that's where they are

174
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,560
any native New Yorkers here that used to
have a rabbit ears

175
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,460
yeah you know he had a $6 Mir operator
living area

176
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,700
his chakra channel two right its now

177
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,180
I'll tell you one thing about this there
is an amateur who put a petition before

178
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,980
the FCC

179
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,310
to reallocate 5254

180
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,740
to bomb FM broadcast

181
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:14,050
and some fortunately it failed um now it
would be nice to have more FM broadcast

182
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,029
frequencies and

183
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,660
that would help for me yes radio and
what other people but at the same time

184
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,199
it takes away from another service

185
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,910
um and all these frequencies to

186
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,029
a lot easier grandfather to maybe a

187
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,520
Joe you can discuss her first get my
even if their history on this

188
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,319
up when radio was new technology in the
early part of the last century

189
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,190
I the government I decided they're gonna

190
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,270
they had a manager's someone had
originally was manage it all rights get

191
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,020
knows what is wide open everything was a
pirate radio station

192
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,870
a but what happened was a

193
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,490
the government with the understanding
that the technology at the time

194
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,720
in the early nineteen hundreds they
looked at the spectrum from what the

195
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,310
physicists for telling them and said you
know

196
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,310
everything up here above

197
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:09,380
two hundred megahertz that's never going
to be useful for anything

198
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,750
let's give it to the hands and a

199
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,130
what happened was we not only fun but it
worked

200
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,250
we found out that work better than
anything else

201
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,000
and the thats basically what we now call
the

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
the the I'm not to a record store meters
are I

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,430
but but the up the situation was is that
we

204
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,850
discovered the technology is Hans to
make that stuff useful

205
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:39,339
so then they chased us further up the
van and said there's nothing up there

206
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:40,029
above

207
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:44,910
about nobody's gonna have a practical
use for anything above 150 megahertz

208
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,290
we came up with repeaters we came up
with satellite communication that was

209
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,899
cheap enough to be done by somebody
other than nasa a

210
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:56,290
wherever they stick us on the band

211
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,529
we creatively find ways to make it work
because

212
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:05,130
unlike when you go out to %uh you can
use FRS GMRS only those public access

213
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,370
radio frequencies it %uh very easily go
up to

214
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,210
right out here on the street corner by
the radios but you can't build your

215
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,440
radios

216
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,470
and you also can experiment with those
radios hams can bill

217
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,670
we are the last we can build

218
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,560
we can experiment we can try new things
we can come up with new ways of doing

219
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,290
things

220
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:30,089
without applying for any kind of special
dispensation from the FCC

221
00:12:30,089 --> 00:12:33,700
we are supposed to experiment

222
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,470
and last time I checked at a hacker
gathering I think that's what we like to

223
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,930
do

224
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,270
and and its is it is an interesting
compliment here with

225
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,360
to with the I hand amateurs and entry
operators in

226
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,300
hands and as the hacking community am
stammer you have reset

227
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,480
early on a really the first electronics
hackers

228
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,089
on communications hackers they figured
out ways to use a

229
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,960
communications technologies new
technologies a

230
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,940
to communicate with each other on knows
analogous define freaky exploring and

231
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,210
the

232
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,830
the public switched telephone network
well Hamza in early part the

233
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,830
like back in the twenties if you get out
ways to communicate have

234
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,310
wirelessly and we think alike but while
medication is a new thing

235
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,810
it's been around for like 80 90 years
and the original hams

236
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,920
a who didn't even if the license because
it was such as Wild West if

237
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,860
up for a non regulation which was kinda
good

238
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,040
the tooth the two tone phone frequencies
that you

239
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,800
here when you dial or when you play
around the DTMF for something like that

240
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,360
there was a time that ma bell would let
anybody touch those

241
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,550
Hamas started using them for control
applications on repeaters

242
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,520
and it was partly due to the ham radio
community needing access to that

243
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,880
that technology that started sum up what
became eventually

244
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,130
the telco breakup so there's

245
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,680
we're in the middle ham radios are in
the midst of all this stuff

246
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,790
so they are first let's explain maybe
what different

247
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,800
what sort of different things we can
expect from different parts of the

248
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,700
spectrum

249
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,880
so how many how many of you guys are
familiar with short-wave radio and have

250
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,390
listened to international broadcast so
good a good chunk if you're familiar

251
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,270
with that

252
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,420
and a familiar with the kind as
propagation that you can expect

253
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,459
a maybe some %uh view our and so I at
the at the

254
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:20,950
relatively lower and a the our spectrum

255
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,899
are the HF bands which is
counterintuitive because that stands for

256
00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:25,380
the high frequency bands

257
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,520
um a long time ago they were considered
the high frequency bands

258
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,880
because like I said I like like skip
said there wasn't really much

259
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,970
going on in sao VHF and UHF which is

260
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,580
very calm today with a handheld radios
so the kinda propagation that you can

261
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,680
expect

262
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,520
are on when you're transmitting were
receiving on these

263
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,110
frequencies is this stuff from all over
the world depending on the time of day

264
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,100
depending on the season depending on

265
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,220
this II where you on the sunspot cycle
different frequency ranges will

266
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,940
propagate differently

267
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,630
Tom and by propagation I mean bouncing
your radio signals of those

268
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:04,200
the atmosphere so you literally transmit
you're a Dr your

269
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,899
RF goes up into the atmosphere bounces
off the atmosphere comes back down again

270
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,290
maybe bounces off something else like an
ocean or or

271
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:16,099
up piece of land that happens to be
reflective to RF goes up again bounce

272
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,980
back down again and this can happen

273
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,959
for you know until you get to the other
side of the world and a and this is what

274
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:22,820
enables us to

275
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,880
communicate across the world and physics
at this get

276
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,899
its you know pretty complicated but it
works really well and

277
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,149
and and this is what enables worldwide
communications without any

278
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,680
infrastructure at all

279
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,600
so on that happens at the lower end to
the our spectrum once you get

280
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,360
up into the VHF and UHF sections are are
types propagation

281
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,110
that do work like that like ducting and
and and other sort of

282
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,940
I interesting features but it's mostly
line of sight so you would be expecting

283
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,130
all communications that kinda stuff that
your police department Fire Department

284
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,580
news

285
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,529
and it all works the same the amateur
radio service as it does in the business

286
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:58,430
pants and

287
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,480
and everything else so that that sorta
where you stand as far as

288
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,570
what kinda X propagation characteristics
you can expect

289
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,279
generally speaking the rule of thumb is
the higher up you go the more dependent

290
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,899
up online to say you are and and the
lower you go

291
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:19,160
depending on the range I propagation
characteristics

292
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,500
not differ a lot you the exception to
that is

293
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,750
two things we have access to that are
pretty unique

294
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,790
as Hans we have access to satellites and
we have access to the moon

295
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,089
a which is a sadly in it I saw this
natural satellite

296
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:37,940
right natural satellite right and out
what happens is that

297
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:42,080
as as as joe is saying about balancing
the signal of the

298
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,320
atmosphere being controlled by the
quality of the atmosphere on any given

299
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,220
day

300
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,630
a satellite is an artificial version of
that whether it's the moon or artificial

301
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,640
satellite

302
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,130
we bounce the signal of that to give it
further distance

303
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:01,410
up there's 12 or 13 handset lights up
right now

304
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,699
front-runner there's a bunch led by if
you can get them up on the idea one now

305
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:05,760
there's a bunch

306
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,470
up the the ISS space station

307
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,030
has amateur radio capability performing
very much like that

308
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,250
up but then moon bouncing is probably
the most incredible

309
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:21,290
and most advanced thing you can do an
amateur radio it's not for everybody

310
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,270
largely because the cost

311
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,540
but the ability to basically use the
moon is a passive reflector to try out

312
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,159
carrier signal around the world

313
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,360
a that's pretty slick so and I wanted

314
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,910
I wanted to own talk a little bit about

315
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:41,710
um a couple have the just kind of a base
we talked a little bit in some detail

316
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,890
about immature but on

317
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,690
this is kinda 0 what you're seeing if
there's kind of a rough

318
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,910
um snapshot I love

319
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,120
some things we talked about you've got a
lot of different types a communication

320
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,990
modes

321
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,370
on a lot suitability to experiment
high-power communications are permitted

322
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,440
based on your license class

323
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,570
um up to 1500 Watts

324
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:11,470
which is you know a huge amount of how
are you way more than you need

325
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:15,710
right for most applications it's way way
more than you need

326
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,150
Tom but a the ability to use

327
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:23,690
a higher power in the reason that they
limit it with license classes because

328
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,650
they teach you a lot

329
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:28,049
there's a lot of stuff in the higher
license classes about RF safety and how

330
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,139
not to %uh fry yourself

331
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,460
um 12 one other restrictions that we
also didn't talk about was

332
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,309
no business communications okay its

333
00:18:38,309 --> 00:18:41,570
purely amateur as defined

334
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,629
cleanly for the love the communication
and that's probably one of the things

335
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,900
that you found

336
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,970
that bernie & I have discussed a couple
times at fault level with

337
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,970
with ham radio is that pam's like to
talk about

338
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,309
ham radio a lot and then that not a lot
of other things

339
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,960
so E you know it can be used for other

340
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,870
applications and then

341
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,480
relief but if you listen to a ham radio
band at any given time you're going to

342
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,010
hear a lot of people talking about

343
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,158
that they're using how the car carrying
member the Sherlock Holmes Amateur Radio

344
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,289
Society I beg to differ with you

345
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,980
okay well there are people talk about
other things on the record

346
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,250
yeah there are but there are a lot of
people that will talk about me know if

347
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,230
you tune across a band

348
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,380
a lot of times the majority what you're
getting here is but

349
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,149
people giving sing or ports and talking
about a pretty good quality of their

350
00:19:34,149 --> 00:19:35,620
signal and their equipment

351
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:40,190
all about improving this there's a
phrase used actually in the FCC

352
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,120
regulations

353
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,139
improving the radio are that's a very
powerful statement the idea that we're

354
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,950
not just supposed to get out there and
talk to one another we're supposed to do

355
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,039
things to make

356
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,059
our own stuff better and work together
to make everybody stuff better

357
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:59,700
thats thats you know there's nothing
more exciting than learning something

358
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,970
new in trying it out

359
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,010
and ham radio let you do that and so
what lynn

360
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,029
when was mentioning you know that that a
lot I have to talk about

361
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:10,470
you know only ham radio but likes get
mentioned that's not necessarily true

362
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,940
and it's i mean it's like that with any
sort of

363
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,720
a hobby if you get a bunch of people who
are into like golf together right the

364
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,940
first thing that they're probably gonna
start talking about his golf

365
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,250
and it sucks or like a common ground and
conversations on your segue into a hole

366
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,679
realm of different things so it's not
it's not limited to have really ok let's

367
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,799
generally what you hear when you first
start a QSL

368
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,379
if we want you to a radio communications
to up for

369
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,740
business purposes and with the
restricted yeah

370
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,679
away from amateur radio there's other
technologies you've mentioned

371
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,010
I N us the Samia Family Radio Service a
lot he seems walkie-talkies you can buy

372
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,309
I for very expensively

373
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:53,740
out or three um GMG Mrs

374
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,389
general mobile radio service and I think
its acronym isn't yet general mobile

375
00:20:58,389 --> 00:20:59,559
radio service and

376
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,639
EP some other things are on here you
know you can conduct quote unquote

377
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,139
personal business

378
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:09,279
%ah you know is compared to

379
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,100
Tom is compared to ham radio it's a UHF
allocation

380
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,220
by in and around the biz the the the

381
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,270
generally assigned business pants

382
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,460
and their 16 channels and speak get some
others are shared with the Family Radio

383
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,429
Service

384
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:29,570
and you're limited to a maximum of 50
watts and some

385
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,439
on other channels you can use a repeater
which he is

386
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,590
a device that sits on a tall building
our mountain top or whatever

387
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,428
that receives on one frequency in re
transmits on other simultaneously to

388
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:43,929
extend your range

389
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,929
as if you were on top of that building a
mountaintop um

390
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:53,230
and there's no %uh antenna team
restriction on GMRS so

391
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:56,510
the get 50 watts is way more than enough

392
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,590
and a lot of the small radios you can
buy it to now

393
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,379
local stores as consumers a will do both
GMRS and Family Radio Service

394
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,169
frequencies in this %uh 14

395
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:10,309
14 Family Radio Service frequency
allocations in their 1680 Mrs rickety

396
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:10,970
allocations

397
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,549
GRC has a licensed RN you text you have
to it's seventy dollars

398
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:19,590
%uh to apply and I think it's
thirty-five dollars a year seventy

399
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,959
dollars a year something like that but
it if that's good for one of the family

400
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,429
billy goat Dale NFAT yeah I have to look
at very few people actually by the slice

401
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,659
sis but a majority let me just tell you
the majority of wal-mart's use GMRS

402
00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:35,270
I and they've never paid for a license
yeah and their life

403
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,158
FRS Family Radio Service is essentially
is the modern version of CB

404
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,490
citizens band is still out there %uh but
but fr-s is basically you can walk into

405
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:44,919
a love

406
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:49,629
all wally world and for 30 bucks have
communication come

407
00:22:49,629 --> 00:22:54,409
another one that's thats recent ruth has
been recently allocated in

408
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:57,450
and not two thousand Mrs has been around
for a long time

409
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,700
okay um be murders multi-user radio

410
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,379
service is of 5

411
00:23:05,379 --> 00:23:10,600
there sa 5 um VHF allocated channels

412
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,590
there is no license required FCC didn't
wanna process licenses

413
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,570
%uh to watts maximum power um

414
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,200
there are some restrictions on how high
the antenna can be but no restrictions

415
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,299
on how much gain antenna and have

416
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,320
a with a top

417
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,520
0 one talking to another talk you're
looking at about five miles

418
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,399
there's no rules on content there's no
rules on encryption

419
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:41,679
bomb you but you have to use an FCC
approved radio

420
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,000
um and experimentation other than your
antenna is not really allowed

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,450
you can use low speed data and when I
say low-speed I mean about

422
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,010
1200 2400 maybe 4800 baud but you have
to stay within the emissions

423
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,020
%uh the ban without cation alanis was

424
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:03,740
lynne's next to last bullet point is
always in my mind the most important one

425
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,860
related to why amateur radio as opposed
to any of the other services

426
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,679
must use an FCC approved radio no
experimentation

427
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,909
ham radio operators can build their own
radios an experiment with them

428
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:21,020
and Joe I'm down into the table as two
radios he built

429
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,850
%uh neither one probably cost more than
twenty dollars to build

430
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,490
and neither one has the capability under
the right conditions to communicate

431
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,730
anywhere around the world

432
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,559
if you want to discuss last couple sex
it will will will will finish did

433
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,539
discuss see all the different types of
services available and then we'll go

434
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:39,158
into specific applications a

435
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:43,110
amateur radio and a and and how we can
use different modes and stuff to

436
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,909
communicate but first we'll finish with
the

437
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,490
different services so far 15 is part 15

438
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,270
is the one place where you can
experiment

439
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,899
without a license okay Tom

440
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:01,700
you can build your own equipment it with
and certain criteria and power output

441
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,480
levels

442
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,740
the output levels are very low okay very
low

443
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,630
there is some allegations %ah

444
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:11,730
and it all over the um

445
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,720
radio spectrum four-part 15 use um

446
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,400
it mostly I SM bands we at our

447
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,220
which are on that chart as well and and
those are areas where you can

448
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,480
use a certain amount of power and with
others restriction and there's people

449
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,120
that

450
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,520
that communicate over hundreds of miles

451
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,910
with part 15 um I wouldn't say that it's
something that would be a reliable form

452
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,179
of communication but it's certainly the
place

453
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,370
to to experiment you can broadcast

454
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,760
although an extremely low power levels
um

455
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:49,540
and the FM broadcast band and in the AM
broadcast band

456
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:53,659
I don't believe that you can use part 15
within the TV and

457
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,770
um specifically they got rid of a lot of
that stuff in the

458
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,690
in the seventies and eighties the
application you may see this used

459
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,190
on a daily basis would be if you if you
drive around you see real estate for

460
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,400
sale and they might have assigned tune
your radio to

461
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,330
1604 1610 to hear about the house

462
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:18,139
those are usually part 15 transmitter an
even more commonly if you have an iPod

463
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,360
I or yeah any player something you want
to hear the

464
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,000
hear that here the signal on your car
stereo system without connecting it

465
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,600
directly likes to need a certain
frequency channeling your

466
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
car radio whatever a thats Mar 15 a

467
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,450
transmitter sewer annealing the
affinities

468
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,190
they call in like a I II age I A on my
side trip

469
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,300
I tres one and in if you use one of
these you know how incredibly poorly

470
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,050
they work

471
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,889
and that by the way research on the
internet there actually hackable

472
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:51,540
yet you can you can do a lot you can
play around with those a lot

473
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,540
oMG it's very output power level a lot
of people say oh as long as it's a

474
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,370
quarter but water less it's okay

475
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:01,580
but if that's not really the case if you
read the rules specifically is something

476
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,350
very complicated and nebulous

477
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,840
to most people om it's really its

478
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,000
part fifteens real intention is for
manufacturers to be able to

479
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,260
um make consumer electronic devices that

480
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,020
don't have your license they don't have
to be licensed so so any any

481
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,480
sorta a small scale wireless device like
a garage door opener or your

482
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,450
portable phone in your house or you know
a remote control for some devices almost

483
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,480
always part 15

484
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,850
and you could find the specification on
the back till lb stickers that

485
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,490
mark that so so does anybody else

486
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,990
%ah there's one other probably

487
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,660
most used part 15 device

488
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,250
its this conference dizzy many have any
idea what that is

489
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,740
wifi there's also an interesting caveat
with wifi

490
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,730
%uh interesting situation with WiFi
that's a ham radio band to

491
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:01,030
we we share that and and I think this is
a good place to talk about primary and

492
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:01,990
tertiary and

493
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:06,110
secretary all that other stuff
government is primary

494
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:09,600
on every way for radio location is
secondary

495
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,560
ham radio is tertiary part 15 is

496
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,720
is %uh way below that start okay in the
wifi band was a

497
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,040
was most commonly used by all this %uh

498
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,970
with our microwave ovens say lead st. I
was the first application while

499
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,030
probably the first common application
for that heart attack back in the

500
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,250
seventies early seventies a migraine
bouncers

501
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,690
first coming company at the FCC figure
how we gotta put these on a sick this is

502
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:35,500
radio energy

503
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,070
with this define a frequency band organ
if they're gonna put these things onto

504
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:43,169
your fear that the services and no they
don't really have much of a choice of

505
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,530
the resonant frequency right for the
nine hundred megahertz a

506
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,560
portable phone started to come around I
can always tell

507
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,909
you know when my wife was making a cuppa
tea downstairs

508
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,350
because I had the right here the signal
on my mice

509
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:00,410
might see our recently a cordless fans
came out on a 2.4 gigahertz and then

510
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,040
wifi

511
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,810
on so that's why you have some
interference sometimes with your life I

512
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,200
can't

513
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,880
a services that could be as somebody
with a cordless founder a microwave oven

514
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,370
interfering with it unintentionally or
it could be your neighbor that's a ham

515
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,230
that's running a 10 watt amplifier

516
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,650
cells we can legally do that actually we
can legally run a hundred watts

517
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,050
spread spectrum with power controller 10
lots without power control

518
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,210
and if you played with WiFi that's a lot
more power than your average person eats

519
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,250
so think about this a hacker can

520
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:32,370
own wifi mmm my want to come here

521
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,980
the right you can do all sorts of
experimentation if you modify

522
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,620
your comment to be able to transmit and
identifiers such as your call sign which

523
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,490
is what are the requirements of using
the service

524
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:44,690
and and play with this stuff and you
have privileges over

525
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,080
what part 15 allows you to do so if
you're interfering

526
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,020
technically I you know they have to
accept that

527
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,090
yet no not not anyone intentionally
interfere with anything but

528
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,300
if it if it's part of the services it is
something that your you have privileges

529
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,020
over

530
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:05,520
you know part 15 a nice if you flip over
your part 15 device Europe you're a %uh

531
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,060
take pick apart 15 device your
television turnaround read the back it

532
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,330
says this device must accept harmful
interference even their parents

533
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,070
it may cause unsatisfactory operation so

534
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,090
%ah if if the

535
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,300
a ham month in this is a very common
scenario with ham gets in your telephone

536
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:23,850
line

537
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,510
%ah

538
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:29,920
in its a part 15 telephone um it's up
between the two love you too

539
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,190
you know him will try to work it out
with you %ah a good one

540
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,090
almost every in almost every case
they're very cooperative and will help

541
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,520
you

542
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,930
eliminate interference or adjust their
station to

543
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:44,760
eliminate the interference because
there's there's no nobody wants to cause

544
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,420
a problem

545
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,470
by you technically don't have any say
over the matter

546
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,160
cell we can we can probably get into
specific applications at amateur radio

547
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,290
so that we don't mine at the time with
that stuff and

548
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:58,690
just get a real quick Icecat Liz gonna
touch in the year this the CB radio

549
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,780
frequencies

550
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,149
so there's forty channels %uh

551
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,930
experimentation other than the antennas
is I'm not really allowed

552
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,130
mom you can have long range
communications

553
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,250
but it's technically not legal there's
actually a techno I'm think it's 50

554
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,950
miles or something 150 mile

555
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,020
cap %ah that you're not supposed to talk
further than that I don't know exactly

556
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,170
how the FCC runs out in blocks radio
waves but that's the cap that's out

557
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:26,610
there

558
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:29,610
%uh you have forty channels um

559
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,340
and two modes I a.m. and single sideband

560
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,130
om which his sights Ingleside means
kinda modified a.m. that day

561
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,060
goes a little further om and and even
use a CB four

562
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:46,540
like like Family Radio Service FRS and
mrs.

563
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,389
you can you see the for any business
purpose is nowhere om

564
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:53,420
no restriction and camber kits music
that you can you know if you're in a

565
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,550
taxicab company

566
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:58,100
um you can you see the ratings for that
and this is where you get a new one at

567
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,680
the

568
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,960
the overlapping gray areas

569
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,780
a of ham radio and other services is

570
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:09,510
the CV band is immediately below her
mediately above

571
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,840
and we look at it below that the
10-meter

572
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,330
amateur radio band CB bandit in other
countries is actually have been injured

573
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,949
in Japan for example to 11 near him bad
um

574
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,030
what happens and and is all all

575
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,250
all-too-common is a people who

576
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,110
happen educ V will buy amateur radio
gear

577
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,650
which can you substantially more powers
we discussed

578
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,450
and modify it for CBUs it's fair use is
probably no

579
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:42,610
more than tweaking a couple OVA ok
passengers are quarles

580
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:47,900
a with this in mind your your you run
across the stories why her about

581
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,370
truckers are something is the most
common story here's a truck around 2000

582
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,830
Watts out the cab of his truck

583
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,360
is probably using a modified ham radio a

584
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,970
but thats that's what are those those
interesting stranger is that so

585
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:03,180
fun do with these pay attention to up
but

586
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,190
10 meters is us and knowing are supposed
to be their lesser licensed alright

587
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:13,110
so she we say going out you have to
right so we can start talking about some

588
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,790
specific applications %uh

589
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:18,659
amateur radio and I don't know it's over
the QRP stuff

590
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,130
i 90 skips into it and and I'm really
into it as well

591
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,030
I want my favorite mods operating within
the amateur radio

592
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,840
a service is saw something called QRP
which essentially means

593
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,660
very low power operation yeah QRP the
the term QRP comes from an old Morse

594
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,860
code signal

595
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,840
which means reduce power you would send
QRP to send

596
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,410
tell somebody to raise property is par
the amateurs are actually if you read

597
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:44,270
the regulation were

598
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,810
were moralist obliged to use the love in
our qualified to use 1500 watts were

599
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:51,540
obliged to use the lowest level of power

600
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,180
necessary to complete the communication
people like joanne i take it

601
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:00,980
to the extreme and we drop QRP in with
an amateur radio community is

602
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,070
essentially considered five watts or
less then below that is QRP

603
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,909
sub P which is one water less

604
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:14,060
and there's people that go lower QR pp
this the room in the back

605
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,310
up where people use less than then

606
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:22,610
than half a walk a people have
successfully to me the the standard

607
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:26,730
award if you wanna call that
demonstration very much a radio skills

608
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,100
working a hundred countries

609
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,500
people have worked over a hundred
countries people worked over 200

610
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,070
countries

611
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,379
with half a watt it requires skill

612
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:39,418
are but the equipment is easily
affordable as you're about to find out

613
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,319
okay so also wanted the cool things
about QRP equipment is that

614
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,770
its not dangerous to work with your
you're dealing with very low power

615
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:47,370
levels

616
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:51,279
so it's its its it's totally okay to
experiment with

617
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,440
arm and generally very easy to build

618
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,650
are you don't have to worry about Mike
much

619
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,690
in terms of interfering with other
things you have someone to that one of

620
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:02,480
the main things that's required

621
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,650
when you build your own equipment is
obviously making sure that you're not

622
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:06,650
interfering

623
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,880
with any other services and and so you
have to

624
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,830
really be knowledgeable technically
about what you have to do to filter

625
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:17,660
the harmonics and and other things in
the QRP equipment it's very easy to

626
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,509
satisfy the requirements and there's
there's not a lot to

627
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,690
hefty equipment involved in that I

628
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,310
a an example here is a little QRP
transmitter this was actually very

629
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,279
common

630
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,310
you can do on you i think it was first
released in

631
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,200
in 7de 76 and it was released in

632
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,910
on a very common amateur radio magazine

633
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,589
at as as a QRP project and so this guy
published a schematic

634
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,410
up the tune it into which is the name is
transmitter and as you can see it's

635
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:46,839
built

636
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,600
and an old tunic and this circuit

637
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,210
the circuit board liaison happen the I
tunic and all the components are kinda

638
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:55,600
sticking out the top so its

639
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,410
its it's it's one of those show of
Greg's week and see all the circuitry

640
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,830
by Tom this this transmitter operates on
40 meter band

641
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:06,540
which is a very very I comment and
that's all seized by

642
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,230
broadcast stations so when when your
international sure International Short

643
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,980
sure we broadcast stations so I your
likelihood have

644
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,920
up picking up European stations and and
stations around the world at night time

645
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,350
is very very high

646
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:22,870
is transmitted puts about a third of a
wideout

647
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:26,040
and and you can use it literally
detected

648
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,820
communicate across the world you can
power it with the something as simple as

649
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,870
a 9-volt battery

650
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,900
or a car battery and it lasts for hours
and hours and hours

651
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,570
on Ike Ike I also have another QRP radio
here

652
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:42,020
this one this design is based on the
pixie to

653
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,910
and this one doesn't have a printed

654
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:51,190
as nice a printed circuit board it's
just basically perforce heart sorry

655
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,990
this is one thing real we don't have
very good lighting here unfortunately

656
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,050
but on if you can see a

657
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,520
I can get the likely effects of the this
is this is something that I just built

658
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,910
on a PC purport

659
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,250
all the components on the top and its
it's this is

660
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,360
kollegah sloppy staff construction
everything is just

661
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,860
sat on the bottom and you know standard
acquire

662
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,920
and this is a transceiver wears a
connection to is just the receiver

663
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,170
transmit I'm sorry and right now they're
both operating on the same frequency

664
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,580
so I can I can give a a short
demonstration love

665
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:28,810
very close range communications of when
I transmit

666
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:32,549
with the tune it into its gonna sound
worse than it would normally sound

667
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,670
because

668
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,710
I'm not loading it up correctly the
antenna is not what its tune to be cell

669
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,540
it sounds a little bit of but the
perceived got this other key or key

670
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,700
receiver here's powered off a nine volt
battery the tune it into

671
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,440
is powered off this power supply can
very easily be power from the battery or

672
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,920
from a car batteries well

673
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,710
cell either the circuits can be built
for under 20 dollars

674
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,910
well under 20 dollars well and I we r if
you have a jump box

675
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,359
the prior everything you need right cell
this this is an example love

676
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:04,990
arm a Morse code transmitted disease on
Morse code this is the key I'm using

677
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,560
a can if you can see it this is a little
portable

678
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,600
CW key I'm sure you guys have sort of
seen these things

679
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,569
in I don't know people seen them yeah
people are seen as

680
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,640
well while CW is no longer required for
the basic license

681
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,180
I it's a very efficient mode of
communication especially a low-power

682
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,000
so people who get into see QRP
inevitably

683
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,840
find their way into into Morse code and
it's really not as hard as people make

684
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,660
it out to be

685
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,740
so basically what that what what it does
when ike cokie down

686
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,130
is basically turns on the transmitter
and the transmitters a very simple

687
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,010
oscillator which is what creates the RF
frequency

688
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:50,010
and an amplifier and it puts out like I
said about a third of a lot

689
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,890
so so I just tidied our station which is
and 6h in Morse code

690
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:01,129
and its and that's all it takes I mean
this in these two devices right here can

691
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,490
literally enable you to communicate
around the world

692
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,830
and they were both killed on a weekend
and

693
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,930
you're using an incredibly small amount
of power if I a typical antenna

694
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:14,220
for this sort of a setup with me a dye
Paul

695
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,780
and for forty meters but that by Paul
length would be

696
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,070
20 meters long and I just people are no
typos just

697
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:24,430
really just be so wire that's a what do
you explain that

698
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:28,009
like the link that you knew it you would
have you would have about 10 meters on

699
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,240
each side and it would come down in the
center with

700
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:34,430
with the PC feelin and thats that's
really all that's required

701
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:38,620
connected to this side a circuit board
right here and

702
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,819
justifies fans out to around sixty-two
feed ish

703
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,650
right give or take and any mounted as
high as you can

704
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:50,190
up comfortably in free space and and
that's really all this

705
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,690
required for simple very basic antenna
setup in it and a transceiver setup is

706
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:58,230
is what I have here with two pieces a
soft Murr

707
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:02,750
in skip to give some examples is a I use
Afrin therapy for a really long time

708
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,080
maybe not really long time to on

709
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,580
with a good like this a you communicated
with the

710
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,710
other other people how far away the

711
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,900
wanted the with it within the QRP
community the

712
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,390
the the the gold standard award is
something called a thousand miles per

713
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:23,930
what I communicated with the Marshall
Islands would have what

714
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,620
hours Marshall Islands the over there

715
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:31,130
haha so um other side the world to i've

716
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,070
I've worked I've worked over 150
countries

717
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:38,310
I've worked all the states over to the
states on

718
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,670
3 the fans I have a couple more to go a

719
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,940
its it's a challenge is it right now
we're at the bus call there's there's a

720
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:45,540
something

721
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,330
as you get into the show aired about the
propagation cycle on the sunspot cycle

722
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,390
and right now where the very bottom

723
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:55,400
that cycle it's very hard to communicate
a

724
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,850
great distances with your P although
it's still possible %uh

725
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:03,430
six years from now I'll be able to talk
everybody get about

726
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:06,540
up that's just one aspect to the hobby
um

727
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:10,259
what's what's nice about your PC is is
is right within the hobby now although

728
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,790
there's experimentation everywhere

729
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,310
the midge a good chunk of the
experimenters are playing with you are P

730
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:20,160
um the idea that you can build you a

731
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,450
you can basically take an old radio out
a career-high

732
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:30,280
out about over trash can %uh and turn it
around and make a transmitter out a bit

733
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,420
the if you know which parts to pull off
that circuit board

734
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,710
that's pretty that that's pretty
exciting to me i i I have to confess

735
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:38,370
that I enjoy building

736
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:42,299
probably more than I enjoy our operating
so I'm is likely

737
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,750
like Joe our bill that put it on year
there on the shelf to build another one

738
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,720
fifth in the the concept a lot of people
don't get his career you know we're

739
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,859
conditioned and a consumer culture

740
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:55,450
the if you want to communicate you have
to pay some company or

741
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:58,839
entity to to use their infrastructure

742
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:02,570
this is using any any government or
corporate infrastructure you're

743
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,930
communicating literally around the world

744
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,419
for free I'm if

745
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,510
with yet without having to pay any
monthly fees or or or

746
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,589
or by air arm inexpensive cell phone

747
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:19,839
I'm that's one of the beauties about to
is kinda communications is your

748
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,980
your you're not dependent on another
another entity

749
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,230
I for their network um usually pay
around the world for free

750
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,410
now as a counterexample to all this QRP
stuff which is

751
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:35,490
%uh is home built radio equipment I have
a an actual commercial transceiver out

752
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:35,830
there

753
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,359
up up on stage facing you guys hopefully
you can see it

754
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:46,359
and a and I'll out I could just show you
real quick how this works

755
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,740
no but the promises not to transfer so

756
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:56,120
so commonly with a QRP equipment a lot
of a lot of it is crystal controlled

757
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,060
which basically I only allows you to

758
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,840
use one frequency at a time of stuff she
with the crystal looks like to resume in

759
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,370
a

760
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:10,109
are the camera in on the honey sodium
per second I will that work

761
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,830
our okay so so this is what a crystal
looks like

762
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:17,630
and this is basically some literally
there's a crystalline there

763
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,120
and it's cut to be resident on the
frequency that I want to use will

764
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:25,630
is which is seven points here 40
megahertz and just coincidentally that's

765
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,880
that crystal as a is the same packet
sizes the crystals that I year

766
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,000
ended up going to federal prison for for
I distributing here

767
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,560
%ah I that is Chris's or 6.2 49
megahertz

768
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:41,040
so you know crystals can be so useful I
things I

769
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,370
so what so basically that circuitry uses

770
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,920
that package that crystal as a reference
point for keeping everything very stable

771
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,850
at that frequency and it works very well

772
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,680
up commercial radios you won't find that
anymore arm

773
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,310
you know forty the fifty years ago that
was more common that you would have

774
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,230
a crystal option with the radius but our
radios these days use what's called the

775
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:04,610
VFL which is variable frequency
oscillator

776
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:07,730
and you'll usually see you know these
big knobs on the radios

777
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:12,000
and it's basically allows you to turn
around so right now I'm set on 7.0 40

778
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,480
megahertz

779
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,780
if you want the U of I clicked something
audio

780
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:20,560
and I got ok but did you take it from me
at transmitted via if you promise not to

781
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,710
transmit although there

782
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,950
a few you took it off the wrong intended
to start the process

783
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,360
going down the the slippery slope
becoming a ham radio operator and

784
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,420
going to be a train your taking the test
just our to realize that that at this

785
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,080
level at the entry level for the hobby
the thing the FCC is the most concerned

786
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,130
about you is putting out a clean signal

787
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:43,470
and proper band it can be very bad
business to be interfering with

788
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,880
communications from an entity that's hey
on a frequency that doesn't belong to

789
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,250
you

790
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,280
and the SEC takes a very dim view that
so

791
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,920
when you get when you take the basic
test just seem the majority the test

792
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,020
anymore we're used to

793
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:59,610
really emphasize theory it emphasizes
rules and regulations

794
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,810
making sure you stay in the right
frequency bands that belong to hams and

795
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:05,049
making sure the signal you put out is

796
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:08,560
as a high-quality and doesn't interfere
by

797
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:12,410
having harmonics up and other people's
gary is a business

798
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:14,819
and that's one of the main
responsibilities that you had as an

799
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,120
amateur radio operator and one of the
main reasons

800
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,210
wider so strange with the exams and and
licensing procedures

801
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,270
so I just just as a demo in the
commercial receiver

802
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,130
I you know this this is what it sounds
like when you don't hear anything and

803
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,020
then I'll demonstrate

804
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:31,280
with this QRP transmitters well what it
sounds like

805
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,280
this up on a hey are I'm to Joe doesn't
know is right now there's some guy in

806
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,110
China

807
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,540
whose hearing this thank you is at your
Zen talk on the back too many new york

808
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:53,029
so so that's that's what it sounds like
when you say i

809
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:58,120
a commercial receiver on its their
transmitter doesn't sound its best like

810
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,960
I said because it's not loading properly
but

811
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,320
but it it usually sounds much cleaner
than that and again you can use it for

812
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,230
world like communications a lot of times

813
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:10,070
you know I hear people coming back to me
with details 1.5 kilowatts or something

814
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,180
which like the legal limit that they
could possibly use

815
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,669
and I'm using you know of one water to
watch or something like that he could

816
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,490
turn on power

817
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:19,500
in you not limited to just I'm in Morse
code with the

818
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,170
with with amateur radio services all
these other mods yeah I'm I am

819
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:26,240
well and and a lot of these are very I

820
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,650
if you're if your primary technology
hobbyists computing

821
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:33,850
we have plenty of mods the play with
that %uh some other coming online new

822
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:34,630
like the link

823
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:38,100
but we have echolink I R L P

824
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:41,430
Internet Relay these are both

825
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,790
ways to tie local repeaters that

826
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,870
are the it's basically a voicemail right
materials

827
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,779
that done by amateur radio and
interconnecting them over the internet

828
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,190
so in that sense you are

829
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,270
relying on a third party but you're not
relying for subscription service

830
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:03,060
and then we have our pure digital modes
packet psk31 ready

831
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,810
radio to traditional radio teletype
these are all very packet radio on psk31

832
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:11,120
are very interesting is again you can
use very low-power

833
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:14,450
basically to put it very but very simply

834
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,000
you plug your computer India Radio and
talk to people

835
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,190
and it's just another form of text
messaging I basically not unlike

836
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,740
yourself and text messaging has been
around for

837
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,640
decades and decades but you don't pay
for but this is this is totally free and

838
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,410
you can send

839
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,509
text messages back and forth around the
world totally free even send small files

840
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:35,640
yeah back now every 30 overhead it I

841
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,850
while we're talking about pac and I just
want a real quickly show you this this

842
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:42,700
is a a system that came out and I've
been involved with this since

843
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:48,000
to begin almost the beginning ovett APRs
automatic packet reporting system

844
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,250
which uses an unconnected protocol to
sand

845
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:55,520
opposition information asset information
weather information

846
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,750
and %uh it blows my mind every time I I
do this but

847
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,520
this is actually coming over the
internet because logistics stuff is

848
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,940
easier to do it this way but

849
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,670
just to give you an idea of how many
people are on APRs in assets are out

850
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:09,330
there

851
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:12,560
on the radio that they get
interconnected back to the Internet

852
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,790
this is the New York tri-state area and
there's more people than that

853
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:19,060
these are just the ones who want to go
out over the Internet and ices

854
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,140
this is all very easily able to be done
without the use of the Internet you can

855
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,790
happy a radio hooked up to the sound
card and have it be much like those high

856
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:27,759
notes just as easily

857
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,010
I don't you get the idea about how many
assets are on there

858
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,100
but doubt but it is really the size
individuals these are a soldier

859
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,940
stationed all with weather stations and

860
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:40,240
the green ones RDG the the blue ones are
that that

861
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,340
cover the map over here I can taking his
son I was sending your call sign out as

862
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,150
a beacon

863
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:48,740
it can be as complicated descending
telemetry from a weather station

864
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,800
a information from from any other
resource that you can take

865
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,970
a create into a packet and and and send
out and the voluntarily transmitting

866
00:48:56,970 --> 00:48:57,370
their

867
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,190
their their coordinates
latitude/longitude so we can see in real

868
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:01,900
time

869
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,700
world is other stations are at their
mobile if they're like arthur

870
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:09,140
portable with an exceptionally useful in
emergency communications which is

871
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,230
primary use

872
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,910
and Henry other things we get to do we
get we get two ways to play TV

873
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,930
%uh amateur radio television a TV which
is very similar

874
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,500
to traditional broadcast TV only you're
talking cam2cam

875
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,640
but we have another mode called slow
scan TV which is done it HF frequencies

876
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,029
and it if it's about a frame every
minute yeah

877
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,190
to frame a minute but it's still a
practical for me communication for many

878
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:34,990
purposes

879
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:39,000
using a very narrow band with less than
less than a tenth the van with that a

880
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,400
regular broadcast signal have preceded
is a picture example via

881
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,540
a picture the key percent from I I'll

882
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,779
a a radio to from here you could even be
low power to her

883
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,210
another station anywhere in the world on
it takes a bit longer than a

884
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,880
conventional television but

885
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:58,100
you can send images anywhere around the
world with other people for free

886
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:02,910
and with fast scan %uh there's a very
easy way to pick up fast and if you do a

887
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:05,259
little research and find out that you
have fast and

888
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,650
TV in your area which is you just
standard television

889
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,940
channel 57 our channel 58 on a cable TV

890
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:17,750
setting it to cable TV mode and looking
into an outside antenna

891
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,170
thats polarize properly and

892
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:25,730
you can pick up %uh immature television
in your area if it exists everyplace

893
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:29,340
doesn't have it and that's not on 24
hours a day like a broadcast station but

894
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,280
you might see some

895
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,180
ugly mugs out there talking to each
other are some nice attractive looking

896
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:34,990
and we did

897
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:39,100
unfortunately we're starting to run the
time you want yes so we're gonna be here

898
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,830
to talk at the ham station about this
all you want about extra stuff but right

899
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:44,620
now we want to hear some your questions
so

900
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:48,210
any anybody with questions that we can
address their like or

901
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,470
whatever I i've I was wondering if you
could discuss

902
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:56,760
ugh a new radio this open-source ready a
movement and what effect that might have

903
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:57,450
on the whole

904
00:50:57,450 --> 00:51:02,110
movement the new radio is is is an
awesome project I'll look into radio

905
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:06,410
is is basically an open source software
defined radio project

906
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:09,700
where you're literally using arms us

907
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:14,050
software to control the RF wait for me
that's up converted to something that

908
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:14,510
you can

909
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,890
actually transmit with and so all the
circuitry

910
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:21,690
that you know that commercial
transmitter is using and the commercial

911
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:22,940
receivers are using

912
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,420
is all done in softer and you have a at
you have a very minimal amount of harbor

913
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,570
that you're dependent upon

914
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:33,110
there's actually a of New Jersey QRP
club I think it's NJ QRP .org

915
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:39,200
cells a little it fits in a USB slot a
little experimental STR radio

916
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:43,110
for about its yeah I think yeah I think
it's of rock forty right I think it's

917
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:43,780
like

918
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:47,660
twenty thirty dollars he could begin
experiment with STR for that little bit

919
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,450
amount of money

920
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:52,610
and and and basically so is so it
eliminates a lot of the dependency upon

921
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:55,710
the hardware to generate the RF and to
do the modulation and all that other

922
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,450
stuff so

923
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:00,010
we can spend hours and hours and hours
talking about software defined radio but

924
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:00,910
essentially

925
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,480
it moves all love the modulation and
demodulation

926
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,760
into software so it's very very flexible
you can come up with all sorts in

927
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,690
modulation techniques that would never

928
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:14,960
have been possible before things we used
to have to do with coils and capacitors

929
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,620
you know do a song can write your own
radio now you can write your

930
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:22,440
me to really write your own radio so any
other questions

931
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:27,180
got I said a quick question i'm new to
him radio I was wondering why the eff

932
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,690
restriction on encryption

933
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:33,180
good question ham radios is it's a
public service is meant to be accessible

934
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:33,940
by

935
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:37,170
anyone who's using the service on with
with

936
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:41,270
cryptography they're not be able to
enforce any of the other rules such as

937
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:46,030
no business communications and and and
all the other restrictions apart 97

938
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,550
arm week in order to get what we have we
have to give a little back it's

939
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,430
interesting when you brought that up
because the the battle for that we were

940
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:54,890
only allowed until

941
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:58,230
the late seventies were only odd
old-fashioned 5

942
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:03,620
a five bed Bartow a ready good music as
he takes forever to get ASCII

943
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:06,990
and now that the floodgates kind open
after that um

944
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,360
but the idea is that the purpose of our
communication is to communicate

945
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,970
to some degree in the clear with other
people in other parts of the world

946
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:19,000
so our encryption is a little more open

947
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,830
next question our numbers a question or
a statement for everybody they

948
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:26,590
the ham radio move up movement or
whatever you wanna call really needs

949
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:30,270
us for people to experiment in going
there

950
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,300
I wouldn't say known no offense to
anybody here but the ham radio

951
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,750
up population is getting older and
they're stuck in their ways and they

952
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,790
really need people like us to

953
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:43,000
start breathing new life into it i've
i've discussed in a couple list like

954
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,710
geez what do you guys do like this we
can use computers for this and I've been

955
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:50,170
regularly scoffed by older people so

956
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:53,640
just you know take your license get into
its lot of fun it's a lot of fun

957
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,500
unfortunately where at halftime now and
we're gonna be by the

958
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,770
and six each station we love to talk to
you if you have any more questions at

959
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:01,860
that we can answer or

960
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:06,170
if you'd like demonstration the station
a ok what we want work one work well for

961
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:08,680
question and then we have a question for
the

962
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,680
day have a clue where we're at a time
I'm weekend we can address it at the

963
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,970
station I'm sorry

964
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:18,750
yachts are at stake on the side well
john's apologize

965
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:25,750
guys K

966
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,120
to
