1
00:00:01,209 --> 00:00:03,479
RI we will

2
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:09,429
get this started area thank you this is
the future of wireless pen testing

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:13,570
with drag ORN who I if you've been to
previous comments

4
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:18,520
seems to be in every one of them as well
are he's never 39

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,670
thorn the gentleman in the middle of
will be known as

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,570
forty-five from this moment forward and
render man

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,180
I who is known as number 112 or

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,750
guy in the Fedora om he is running

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,910
blank already hi everybody

10
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,040
pledge make arm you are making customer

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,910
now there's just a lot out there and
Mike notice that before

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,100
are work gonna talk today about the
future wireless

13
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,130
penetration testing but obviously to

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,540
talk about the future we gotta contigo a
picture

15
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,810
what we did in the past what's

16
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:06,950
work currently so I'm gonna talk first
about the history just a little bit

17
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,500
and we're gonna bounce around different
topics for today are

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,280
back in the 0 late 1990s

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,510
for around two thousand lot of
Technology start come together with what

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,630
our list of the big push came

21
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,798
when in about 2,000 one

22
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,409
802 11 got extremely for by everybody at
the consumer level

23
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:33,510
least are at that point Wireless

24
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,729
contest really start takeoff all

25
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,700
though first kind of programs came out
about

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,750
frumpy Chipley done early script

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,570
San Francisco back 2001 all

28
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,830
nets number was written also 2001

29
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:58,830
late 2001 tricor for Spurs kiss me thank
you for the many hours of entertainment

30
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:13,299
so at that point people start to become
aware of this stuff

31
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,349
being available that you was kinda hopin

32
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,129
out there and the whole thing really
story takeoff

33
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,569
I did my first four drives

34
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,650
about September 2000 while in five miles

35
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,200
came up five networks Paris

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,230
that today I think there's something

37
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,510
your about 300 networks same five miles

38
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:41,529
so and

39
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:46,049
if are so that

40
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,069
kinda brings us up to today that we
we've got this big jump

41
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,249
its out there everybody starting to get
involved in it and

42
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,049
work I know hun talk about the rest to
the

43
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,650
the panel or the such in today's real
talk about what we're going to do in the

44
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,180
future

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,579
so with that on Turner overdrive

46
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,540
up figured she'd touch a little bit
briefly on what kids will be doing in

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,150
the future

48
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,650
all the major rewrite has been in the
works for

49
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,519
little over two years since just before
the last I wish I could say it was done

50
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,790
for release today i cant but gets a
version

51
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,608
in the states and currently the main
things are useful for pen testing that

52
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:28,480
will be in a release

53
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,029
is because it's only supports forgets so
every time I say

54
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:36,189
I'm not going to put that in there
someone else can the plugin you can do

55
00:03:36,189 --> 00:03:40,549
injection through it a will be smarter
drones so that you can treat

56
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:43,599
remote capture is like the Lynx's
connect to Windows machine

57
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,930
as a local car and plugins can do

58
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,370
anything decade you can add GPS systems

59
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,199
there might even be a plugin to handle
to built into the system

60
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,150
and will takes more questions on that

61
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,339
after I'll turn it over to 104 San

62
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,469
11th thank I'll

63
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,069
basically with the future of Wireless
there's

64
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,409
a couple a difference areas where C
speak eleven's

65
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,500
here to stay rivet Bluetooth

66
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:21,130
scum big that's good others Fisher &

67
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,080
RFID its wireless broken have to deal
with it somewhere

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,520
starting at: the 802 11 stuff

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,840
811 hi the news

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,200
while Specter security spec usually
Michael

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,270
wpa2 its not the actual ratified version

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,409
um I don't know what the IEEE

73
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:47,540
working group are thinking on these
things are delighted to see some severe

74
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,800
problems with

75
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,860
802 11 I coming out reason being is a
few Alexis

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,250
factors this wonderful little statements
in there say

77
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:03,040
there's a a function called Michael can
measure message integrity check

78
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,530
basically if an access point turning
into a benign received two messages

79
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,720
that have at check someone's on the
packets

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,470
it will shut down the radio and Rican
cute all the keys

81
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,280
and renegotiate everything does this
it's just on a review for 60 seconds

82
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,460
when it does this it's Enzo at the
authentication packet to all clients

83
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,840
saying I'm going down because something
went wrong

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,730
hands I'm recapping things

85
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,470
within this back there's a smurf a line
that says

86
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,470
because we can't verify the authenticity
St authentication packet from the access

87
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,630
points being

88
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,920
actually from the access point you know
it can be spoofed we're just going to

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,900
ignore it

90
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,060
and continue trying to connect that same
SSID

91
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,470
address so ice and

92
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,400
two packets the radio with bad

93
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,320
message integrity checks the returns of

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,320
and now I can slide in my own access
point with the same SSID and mac address

95
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,210
this this is gonna be interesting

96
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:17,739
I don't know what the 802 11 group
naturally are thinking with these things

97
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,370
just don't seem to the catching on

98
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,780
there are problems they have the ability
to address them when they're signs

99
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,300
tax just do anything say

100
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,450
on a similar note the 211 W spec

101
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,630
is going to address finally some the
access point

102
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,790
indication measures to keep it from

103
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,600
being so easy to knock it off network
except they don't address

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,940
management friends use people the
network

105
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,240
so anything that there's things two
years away from

106
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,630
ratified its stuck in the meantime

107
00:06:55,630 --> 00:07:00,620
here

108
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,610
and to add to that whole thing to is
that lotta stuff is getting

109
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,050
unplugged getting thrown out the same
spectrum

110
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,130
all for instance just something learned
last night

111
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,150
is sure you're all aware lotto burglar
alarms Center

112
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,200
going towards a lot of those things are
basically

113
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,139
by firearms they're basically just kinda
out there going

114
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:27,560
not our state not not and netbooks

115
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,070
I'm an alarm state I'll

116
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,300
and that's not a big deal until you
realize that some other

117
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,830
devices or directly up

118
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,919
actionable on the outside the building
for instance are things that are

119
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,970
honors Knox boxes that carry the keys

120
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,290
two buildings he's just designs for the
fire department can gain access to the

121
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,690
billing

122
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,990
case for emergency he uses his own
apartment buildings little

123
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,020
ft logo on things we will try and what
type thing

124
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,159
mom those things if they get triggered
off will actually

125
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,980
start open on some alarm systems now
allowing anybody

126
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,490
hopefully the far apartment book if
anybody his spoof

127
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,740
the alarm system up you can gain access
to the building physically bike

128
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,690
the building is just handed key so the
big ones like should give you a

129
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,850
blueprint so you

130
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,470
can have blueprints and icky I'll

131
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,930
so there's a lot of things like that
they're getting up flood so

132
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,769
is as things are changing and evolving
with

133
00:08:32,769 --> 00:08:35,818
10 testing in general I'll were just

134
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:40,769
were going strictly from kinda be on the
polite to Euro

135
00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:43,959
the information into you physical

136
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,040
access to the buildings at the same time

137
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,379
people were just taking all lot of
things and saying well it's really easy

138
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,089
to unplug it and they're not thinking
about the what the ramifications are

139
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,720
as a they go law for instance a security
camera

140
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,949
so you can check to make sure no ones in
that

141
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:06,800
part of the building for you block

142
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,889
act there was a real good example
because those things are completely

143
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:10,829
unplugged

144
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,220
completely insecure and because they're
based on

145
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,610
the regular television signals

146
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,230
their specifically not for so anybody

147
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,110
if you don't the frequency is for a
given

148
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:30,759
camera can just tune into the camera and
see what's going on

149
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:36,639
how many remember that the opening scene
from movie sneakers

150
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,980
for for those you down basically they
set off the smoke bomb inside the bank

151
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,350
safe deposit box smokers up sets off the
fire alarm

152
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,399
automatically only emergency fire doors
open up which

153
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,779
lows guys to run in the back security
guards there

154
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,129
bombs going off just want to do it's a
phone call saying I would have a

155
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:56,480
surprise for the alarm

156
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,800
will shut off internet ok it does

157
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,379
now everybody's so you can imagine a
situation where

158
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:07,899
with this alarm system trigger it no
fire

159
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,610
trigger player do this enough times
cheaper anything

160
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,629
something's bus something shorted
whatever

161
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:17,629
future for the next time just walk up
and take keys because know the fire

162
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:19,040
departments from an economical

163
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:26,040
because up it's just an error

164
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,690
client attacks only view

165
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,110
run farrell's normally on your laptop
connected on a wireless

166
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:40,499
condition Hamza

167
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,589
arm the people who can see that was
probably about 10 to 15 percent raise

168
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:45,199
their hands

169
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:49,249
and new tools coming outs

170
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:53,790
you know it is going to some interesting
stuff coming

171
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,969
Def Con about 802 11 fuzzing and attacks

172
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,899
to drivers for wireless cards for a long
time everybody's been focusing on

173
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,949
attacking access point can access the
network that way

174
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:09,949
has been more and more research coming
out boats

175
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,119
attacking the clients themselves neither
getting to come over to another access

176
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:14,559
point

177
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:21,559
or just doing nasty things to their data
this

178
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:27,089
evil twin 0 between concepts

179
00:11:27,089 --> 00:11:30,439
just I think that there's gonna be a

180
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,709
lot more focus on getting access to
those clients

181
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:37,660
his we've all seen the businessman it's
in the airport doing is

182
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,279
spreadsheets or whatever in you never
know as an athlete next year

183
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,790
sometimes it's me friends ever fired up
a sniffer

184
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:50,459
noticed how many networks the Windows
machines are programmed for near you

185
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:55,360
how easy is it to create one of those
networks how

186
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,619
likely is it that they have a firewall
turned on for his room not very

187
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:04,019
and it's really easy to just prove
something

188
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,669
like Lynx's and all the sudden you're an
access point

189
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:12,810
think you're connecting to it's actually
am

190
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,650
enemy how many people you know I'm not
seeing anybody here does it because it

191
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,439
would be a felony

192
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,490
but how many people do we know the take
advantage to the links its global

193
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,070
network

194
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,740
how do you know that is actually a Lexus
access points

195
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,400
and not just somebody doing man in the
middle or or whatever

196
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,290
because you can never speak that right

197
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:41,290
this today

198
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,210
starts quick question this quick hands
up

199
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:49,090
how many have you on your access points
at work or home have the SSID

200
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:56,090
broadcast turned off why

201
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:02,800
just oh nobody can see you

202
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,720
there's just so much

203
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,089
bad information out there I mean were
guilty over to a certain degree is

204
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,670
prolongs timers in turn off SSID
broadcast by

205
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,029
there so many I see people out there
that reads

206
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:18,569
a book that the same do all these things
and if I

207
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:23,509
well half the time the future of this
city broadcasting have more problems

208
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,290
connecting

209
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,849
if you don't so just gimme more more
problems with

210
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,060
people just understanding instructions

211
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,620
RTFM goes a long way

212
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,230
believe towards the end of Nov

213
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,689
replicating networks the Karma tool is a
modification of the method of course

214
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:44,480
with their arse

215
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,740
which will automatically create a
network for ever

216
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,540
quest sees you don't even have to clean
the network any

217
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,769
it will just bring up the axis it'll
automatically respond to any program

218
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,180
quest

219
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:04,180
and it s interior another thing in the

220
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,220
romance client abilities is for her own
abilities I haven't seen any yet

221
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,540
but and authors card is basically an
armed seven ships running

222
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,790
fairly complex peace offer and for you
ever find a bargain that firmware

223
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,759
how often do you update that I

224
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,230
I haven't seen many from updates come
out there's a bug in there

225
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,240
you've got XQ execute ability on a
device attached your PCI bus

226
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,790
that means you've got a device that you
control test to someone's

227
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,559
memory system forget the operating
system controls

228
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,300
you can scan the emirate of if anyone
ever exploits the firmware

229
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:49,300
who knows

230
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,830
you know it's just in in we got some
stuff we've talked to before talked

231
00:14:58,830 --> 00:14:59,680
about few minutes

232
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,020
ago a lot of this stuff is all shaking
part

233
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,520
same spectrum to you get cameras like
the extents

234
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,900
those things are all over the place

235
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,950
you've got obviously 802 11

236
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,330
be anchee the same space

237
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:19,440
and some of these things ornate it
together

238
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,650
some such as me G solar you put in

239
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,760
camera an access point

240
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,810
close proximity you get problems
basically the whole spectrum

241
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:38,120
lot of places really getting overcrowded
it's not uncommon in some

242
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,500
places to actually have someone fee

243
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,050
an ad hoc coordinator for the spectrum

244
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,060
in their building just because it's
getting so Crowder in the neighborhood

245
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,890
because it's getting so crowded and

246
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:57,280
is only going to get worse people so

247
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,480
one other things do you with the pen
testing

248
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,690
you're gonna be taking look at the whole

249
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,540
gamit in a given spectrum area is to

250
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,939
what kind of things are in there what's
for what is

251
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,190
it's not just gonna be it's not gonna

252
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:18,650
just peachy it's gonna be things like
care spend

253
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,310
things like burglar alarms which are
also in in the 2.4

254
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:29,310
megahertz spectrum your spec it also
means that you have to consider things

255
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,380
that are no longer within that Specter

256
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,320
are Ubiquiti Networks now has a 900
megahertz

257
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,710
a service-based able to 11 cards
actually

258
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,290
up most IDS system

259
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,500
Center detecting a summons clicking on
authorized access point their network

260
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,260
they're not looking at 900 up Bluetooth
access points

261
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,260
they exist I believe kensington makes
one ok

262
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,100
makes most idea systems aren't looking
for Bluetooth access point but still

263
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,800
means it's there and connect to it

264
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,380
and now possibly gain access to the
network via that speaking about

265
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,750
Bluetooth just shorthand so many people
%uh have Bluetooth telephones on

266
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,640
today huh

267
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,920
and I've got one but I keep it i capable
to a

268
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,130
of fun a lot of functions on just

269
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,520
of that how many view are running

270
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,449
in discoverable that would be 37

271
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:30,640
for the record I'll

272
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,330
one person in the Packers hand that I
could see how many

273
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:39,870
know that you have it discover may be OK
Sports

274
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,460
this is not the device you're looking
for like berries

275
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:49,720
100 shown sir Brian Ventura in the
audience

276
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,000
there is

277
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,330
this is just a quick sample of a group
of people who

278
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,330
should no exactly what their devices
doing

279
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,720
now how many keep company

280
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,590
executives in that are gonna fully
understands the problems with leaving

281
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,260
their

282
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,980
Bluetooth phone enables this is
something that eggs

283
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:16,540
really term but as more and more data
and supplies devices

284
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,710
out there walking around maybe
discovered early on these

285
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,400
its mixer it's easier to use you know
their

286
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,290
could be exposing all sorts its enemy

287
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,320
not even connected to the corporate
network all sorts of

288
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,030
on can when this handheld devices

289
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,879
looks emails stuff just

290
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,380
the problem is no longer just contained
within

291
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,100
the building you have any control or
these guys around around the world

292
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,130
signing contracts

293
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,530
chase after them them down there in the
office

294
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,090
did in there's a problem here medicare

295
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,169
this yeah and it and

296
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,270
a lot of these things to do this you
know just the physical security devices

297
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,500
let's faces how many people will put
things like passwords

298
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,060
on PBS you lose the PDA you've just

299
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,399
will given to were fine Z your list voy

300
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,950
passwords and it's a PDA

301
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,570
talks via Bluetooth and WiFi to other
devices around it

302
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,530
are you creating bridging that you never
even suspected

303
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,550
maybe not but this possibility and again
if you're going to be doing

304
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:34,040
and kinda penetration testing you've got
a you wear these things and at least be

305
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,100
thinking

306
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,240
lines of can we go from device 8

307
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,630
my speed if I C in the end
infrastructure what you gonna device a

308
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,830
leave something that when they kept the
infrastructure

309
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:53,260
it's you this would be with cancer
device

310
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,170
this teddy bear as an access point built
in 2000

311
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,980
how many people would be rogue hunting
for teddy bear

312
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,200
throwing out a lot one thing with you to
let mister

313
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,480
miss access points for getting smaller
and smaller

314
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,280
you're not dealing with the big links is
Fox more

315
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,790
for your sisters dealing one it's like
the size a us-based

316
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,670
its it's a little bit bigger to punish
in a half square

317
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,150
but its it's a great divisive carry
around from for going to different

318
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,800
places

319
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,000
and its its literally about this big

320
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,210
you won't notice is an access point much
no

321
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,410
look picture a rabbit ears filing
cabinet

322
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,000
and satisfied something like this one in
the bag PC

323
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,220
you know Star Search behind both

324
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,540
or battery pack the delivery of flowers

325
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:54,540
secretary don't give away all my secrets

326
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,620
how many people have Bluetooth headsets

327
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,470
how many people have the pitter the
Bluetooth enough 4 0's

328
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,429
50 how many do you wear them all the
time

329
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:14,690
how many have seen people on buses
subways standing on a street corner

330
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,720
looking actually schizophrenic you know
talking themselves

331
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,340
if I goats up from a hotel in years

332
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,540
default teens on all these things it's
always

333
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,320
40 us no matter what model 64's

334
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,428
or 1234 of its

335
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:37,320
anytime you have people like that can't
change Analog Devices

336
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:44,189
ago Motorola and 500 its its hardcoded

337
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,630
but I phone for camera Bluetooth

338
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,950
what when I'm where s your problem and

339
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,350
one thing I actually want to see happen
all these people

340
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,679
around subways here's their headsets on
all the time

341
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,800
somebody needs to find a way to
broadcast

342
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,870
States we need to introduce

343
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,150
like an omission voice into the back you
know it's their heads and say

344
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,870
I Know What You Did I have the pictures

345
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:19,870
somebody needs to do with its

346
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,940
if they can do it with some cars with

347
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,370
program a car whisper but I think you
need to do this on a more personal level

348
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,590
it's nice to be able to reach out and
say

349
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:37,959
a jackass you just cut me off come from
taxi driver

350
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,320
distance you know i i think im medium or
personal

351
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,720
stir scare daylight savings people or to
invert that

352
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,370
open up the microphone and broadcast it
other people on

353
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:00,370
on other it sets

354
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,240
0 there is coming

355
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,020
such as we go fishing in a few notes for
I'll

356
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,980
RFID is something its as a couple really
good talks this morning eyes

357
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,830
something is all around us

358
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,059
whether want it to be hit some balls
deep house

359
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:32,460
it's in the cards for it's everywhere
why

360
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,929
Our Lady us I

361
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,529
is already being used skits there are so
many

362
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:44,450
examples one of which passports

363
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,559
August this year US is disturbing

364
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,668
RFID chips in there passports to be read

365
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,600
when you go across the border why do
they need to be read at a distance

366
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,850
is there bulletproof glass is something
that prevents them from

367
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:02,460
you know going from this far away this
far away there are so many contact

368
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,500
bassist

369
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,539
its a solution looking for a problem and

370
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:10,950
you introduce so many problems this

371
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,529
ands most people don't seem to
understand

372
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:18,210
when you introduce our you're
introducing

373
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,820
levels complexity can fail on you if
your inventory control system

374
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,010
is based on our well

375
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:30,340
what's the lace like single manufacturer
says good for a hundred thousand

376
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,699
meets well drive a Mack truck over and
see

377
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,570
creates these sort of things happen if
you're depending on this

378
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,860
its gonna fail and

379
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:45,690
you're going back to the idea that can
testing with this

380
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,820
is if your gonna be doing lot of

381
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,470
10 testing and his our fight element
into the building for instance axis

382
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,730
parts is just one more air where you're
actually gonna be

383
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:04,730
Anwar your kinda penetration testing
system so

384
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,810
Johnson West use was talking this
morning

385
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,220
leading the implanted there's a our

386
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,890
his little has a project it's just a
little credit card size

387
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,670
circuit board two switches once I one
reads

388
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,680
the other forecasts so all you have to
do is just walk up to somebody

389
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,460
it one but slaves their it activates
likes their

390
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,590
the access codes for are proximity card

391
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,970
yet but it's rebroadcast this is
something that needs to be done

392
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:45,720
elevators subway escalators walking past

393
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,750
keys to the kingdom are being broadcast
on small radio

394
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:57,080
executives pockets I believe US
passports last for 10 years

395
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,129
felt so it secret

396
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,100
how much could do was developed ten
years ago which has been broken since

397
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:12,100
boasted think anybody remember wept of

398
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:17,740
now or even md5 sale

399
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,310
what's the likelihood up this technology
surviving your passport for 10 years in

400
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,649
a way that's going to be secure

401
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:28,750
we don't know of and the thing is they
are releasing a tease

402
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,930
these passports to public for testing
that shit to me

403
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,140
malicious but I would love to get my
hands on these things

404
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,770
baby integrated tin foil from the back

405
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,920
can't read it looks close well fan of RF
energy

406
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,430
something this is something that needs
to be tested

407
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:53,660
for some strange reason state department
doesn't like sending samples

408
00:26:53,660 --> 00:27:00,660
passports foreign nationals why okay

409
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,450
were gonna open up to questions and
answers and

410
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,140
they fastest my people if you do wanna
talk to us

411
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,910
ask question please come up use
microphones and any ideas you have

412
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,950
future too two questions for you first

413
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,540
flash files have you guys heard anything

414
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,860
solid haha next

415
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,080
exploiting s possible

416
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,399
and the second thing ask use use

417
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,310
laptops fights I haven't heard anything

418
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:41,620
well there was the chernobyl

419
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,950
and remember fires %eh CIA switch with
Duke your BIOS

420
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,680
I don't see any reason it would be
difficult to

421
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,910
match the correct files to Flash your
system

422
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:56,370
but I see no reason that you couldn't
slash malicious files assist

423
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:59,770
its little development that most people
are doing right now

424
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,190
but if there were a reason with enough
money behind

425
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:06,810
I don't see any reason why would be
possible the same would go for flash

426
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,040
full access points

427
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,110
or even downloadable firmware with like
a slave driver update that

428
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:16,180
did downloading from her from the client
machine in the

429
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:19,980
like an author's Carter pretty much
anything else these applicable for now

430
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,630
is no reason that they couldn't download
some malicious rumor that did something

431
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,630
either

432
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,200
terrible overtly or covertly monitor

433
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,420
data because last time I said you might
have confrontation of

434
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:39,510
some I can't think sawyer though or
things any

435
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,590
talking about their still working on it
flee um

436
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,450
basically with a lot of consumer
off-the-shelf

437
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:50,760
access points there running when it's a
flashable

438
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,360
firmware but there's no way to verify
the firmware thats

439
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,270
actually running on their is the one
that's supposed to be there

440
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:02,360
they can log in and see this nicely sis
web interface

441
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,510
that actually know what's running into
the hood how do you write

442
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,010
how do you to an antivirus can I rather
this is something that things can turn

443
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,310
bites near future and its

444
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,889
in relation to this the blue to scanning
Lexus

445
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,180
you know USB adapter class on nothin we
fancy

446
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,690
and network industries blue sky missus

447
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:31,100
not anything there was scary this is
just a quick test

448
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,890
said news before talk here also for
Linux there's a

449
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:39,160
T Vere and a few other similar scanners

450
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,500
that own just list all the

451
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,120
cards that are open for activity

452
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,620
just a curiosity question how many have
you when you're looking for rogue access

453
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,240
points

454
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,390
year businesses or consulting

455
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:57,960
how many roses going for Bluetooth
curious not many

456
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,820
have think the

457
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:05,610
person in front yeah I didn't have a
question moreover

458
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,860
like Connor statement you could build
stuff like RFID in all this crap

459
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,870
because it creates the markets they try
to get people interested in it and it

460
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,650
was breaks

461
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:16,900
for anyone who breaks the introduce
another market to fix it

462
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,230
and they that's exactly what software
and II

463
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,510
IT security for a living people and

464
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,780
you see all the products other money on
this crappy keep buying any by more crap

465
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,990
that's broken see can get more crap to
fix the crap that's broken you get a

466
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,520
consultant to fix the craft the brokers
you own a house broken

467
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,320
any it all it is is just a buncha shit
his mind that's what it is

468
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,510
and it just is perpetuating its birth
it's all of Earth's

469
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,910
all of this great markets

470
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:51,710
have you seen installations Wireless
little spin cuddly amounts of money

471
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,530
fighting

472
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,629
specter me can't figure out how to keep
this thing running

473
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,760
think it's like okay 100 bucks all draw
wire

474
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,879
here you're not moving for this location
why do you need

475
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,120
Wireless person in the middle

476
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,590
I have personally encounter that Nick

477
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:14,440
check something returns a radio off for
60 seconds so i'd like

478
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,380
Michael kinda measures yet yeah huge

479
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,280
side determinant is broken and we all
know what is broken

480
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,830
so is it possible to run WiFi network

481
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,340
has any encryption WPA

482
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,910
done right key the moderately acceptable

483
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,910
a home what I prefer my own networks

484
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,010
not in the business and whatnot would be
to

485
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,540
sometimes even just turn off weapon
tirely leave the network open

486
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,060
and then use layer 3 incursion VPN

487
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,899
Open VPN is that simple to setup I
believe it runs on OS X Windows

488
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,090
1x arm and

489
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:58,810
there you go just for all of your access
point something %uh from the rest your

490
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,350
network

491
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:02,490
only allow the ZP imports VPN server

492
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,550
and internal everything over from there

493
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:08,810
just another kinda question it to people
generals

494
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,169
choice and how many people are actually
running any kind of our wallets

495
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,220
separated

496
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,130
the wire portion world's force

497
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,560
not to its moral expected

498
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,679
so how long is it gonna be before I can
throw out my cow patty

499
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,640
mine

500
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,490
aircraft can all rest to those finally
integrated

501
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:32,810
is how much interest to you see people

502
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:37,370
write a plugin a get easy answers right
a plugin

503
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,330
the harder answer calcutta actually
something that would be reasonable to do

504
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,030
is a plugin

505
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:45,660
because it's more for real time thing a
aircrack

506
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,910
builds a large database of packets

507
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,570
and then does lots scary math on them I

508
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:58,260
don't think that's really a runtime: as
much as a post-processing because

509
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:01,420
every time that impact probably have to
start recalculating

510
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:05,490
all your day to day run so far and i
could be a couple days worth of work

511
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,900
some cases accessing any really
interesting polls

512
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,040
I'll I haven't seen too many

513
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,770
yet %ah mainly I'm hoping that I can

514
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,870
you know turn the API X and people think
of things I didn't

515
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,380
and for things where I didn't want
integrated

516
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,400
the source wanna things up trying to do
is keep his yes

517
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,520
it just makes my life much simpler than
I can say to people

518
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,860
its architecture they might do something
with it an attacker

519
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,910
but a so in this case when I have

520
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,820
things I don't want to integrating the
code I can have people like this plugins

521
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,370
share the blame yes share the blame pass
the buck

522
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,640
it should also allow it to be much
easier for it to Windows

523
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,130
and if there are any drivers in the
future for Windows 7 capture

524
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,760
it should be possible to do complete
capture search in Windows

525
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,550
you thirty to capture sources: mixes
appliance

526
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:08,550
thanks

527
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,409
right okay on I recent leave

528
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:17,480
read it somewhere a fellow an attack
involving sending packets that explode

529
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,679
the actual try for of the network cord
so you don't actually have to be

530
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,520
accepting connections are from being
together that's going to be the talk at

531
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,020
plaque

532
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,629
I don't believe the details on that have
been released estimate simple math stuff

533
00:34:29,629 --> 00:34:30,129
from

534
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:33,649
know the idea are you talking about the
recent ones can be a black

535
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:36,790
yeah it is yep

536
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:39,989
release many details on it basically for

537
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:44,480
you might not know worked for talking
Shrek on civil no man gave a talk

538
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,530
title in the friendly skies survey
thought it was a

539
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:51,970
airplane crash or something what it was
was

540
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,179
it figured that he saying back in cattle
class

541
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:00,190
and its executives front there's
stamping

542
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,450
laptop you're in an environment where
there's no other access points

543
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:09,129
well it was awful XP on the fronts
please turn off wireless devices

544
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,250
most exec is prolly know how to do this

545
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,910
to a really high executives so they
leave

546
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,560
flutie are they leave their their wifi
running well

547
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,349
supplement basic figures awaits you

548
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:30,280
get thats to connect his laptop to
there's without them having to configure

549
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,820
and its you sitting in back health class

550
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,849
shares and everything sales interest is
your nicotine environment people

551
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:42,890
expect Wireless this other one

552
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,960
is released black spacey

553
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,520
802 11 fuzz struggles for scrap wireless
drivers

554
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,770
in washington fail interesting one case
fairly spectacular way

555
00:35:54,770 --> 00:35:58,080
no details yet see

556
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,049
from the public publicly released stuff
that was I believe on the black cap

557
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,140
agent Slashdot

558
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:06,339
it sounds like its a blog

559
00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:09,779
at the driver level basically the
Windows kernel

560
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,349
which would let you send

561
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:17,970
a couple friends and own windows at the
kernel but

562
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,580
you'll have to wait for the black have
recent Asian for that arm

563
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,650
the interesting thing about driver tax
in the future

564
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:27,950
is that so what if you're running a
firewall

565
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,520
it just got on with the wireless layer
forecasted to the IP layer

566
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,140
assuming it was even a different answer
questions yeah

567
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,270
thank you anyone else

568
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,450
show

569
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:50,450
looking at something

570
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:55,630
is the API on CBS yet the

571
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,789
plugin API is in Subversion the whole no

572
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:02,299
development is in some versions publicly
accessible arm

573
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:06,049
it's actually the plugin API is part was
running the access points here

574
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:09,880
this year so the access point control
mechanism to configure them off from the

575
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,250
NOC

576
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:14,010
is actually a plugin kids which
configures radius

577
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,380
least so

578
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,710
I remember last year there was some talk
about USB device

579
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,020
exploring USB drivers no is kinda came
back

580
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,650
over wireless as anybody figure next
week

581
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,279
runs on a PCI bus a action con

582
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:36,670
Hickory head a talk for a car his name

583
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,940
%uh had a talk up briefly about

584
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,900
using the PCI bus to do reverse DNA
mapping are

585
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,670
there's also mention their what you got
what you talkin bout with USB I believe

586
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:52,000
is not actually a USB driver hack its
use the hardware hack

587
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,020
if you confuse the USB bus sufficiently

588
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:00,520
you you can game DNA access the system

589
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,609
which allows your device plugged into
the USB device or use the bus to map

590
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:06,710
system memory starting invites here

591
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,369
out from underneath windows or whatever
operating systems running and then

592
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:11,980
modified

593
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,150
slightly different tack

594
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,700
cue infertile there was a slightly
different attack

595
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,710
yet that would be a physical attacks
after I believe there's a similar one

596
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,869
announced that far

597
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,650
all I'm sure if you google you can find
more on them

598
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:32,039
I'll I don't see any theoretical reason
why you couldn't perform a similar tack

599
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:38,650
with a a firmer exploit to a car bus or
mini PCI card but

600
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,630
I haven't seen it done maybe we will

601
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,010
it would be very complex to do but that
hasn't stopped

602
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,589
previous very interesting attacks from
happening thanks

603
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:57,779
I just wanna say looking at it for 11
security in the last couple years

604
00:38:57,779 --> 00:39:00,859
gone from web where they're saying I is
just

605
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:04,680
forty weapons okay I think we've gone
from hiding your SSID

606
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,140
forty-fifth wept if I mean there's a
point where forty this

607
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,279
forty bit weapons Lee get as the expert
restrictions

608
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:14,380
128 I was founded

609
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,970
sock so what's WPA that problems

610
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,819
wksu and that the that sprawls

611
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:25,630
start looking like countermeasures
issues

612
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:30,049
Def Con EPA's

613
00:39:30,049 --> 00:39:33,450
bulletproof somewhere along the line

614
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,510
we're probably gonna catch up but time
we've moved on

615
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,200
will be way ahead at there just seems to
be no

616
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,430
same way here to 11 right now short

617
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,288
with just what's packaged with EPS

618
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:53,520
other products and top I just think that
the IEEE

619
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,529
working group really need to get their
act together

620
00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:01,000
realize the need to keep pace with
everybody else

621
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,079
and when you view this

622
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,319
have businesses you support or even at
home your gears still

623
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,329
only web capable you know about 11 or
something like that

624
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:17,750
number so many businesses will invest in
the infrastructure

625
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:23,390
and Security Auditor Cummins yet you're
secure you got everything's good now

626
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:26,808
all how many keeping up on this

627
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:30,960
the Internet this feels like changes

628
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,160
in policy don't there so many cases
where business policies

629
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:40,640
0 remote offices to run for

630
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,848
revisit months well the next three
Slayers secured

631
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:47,970
water so far behind her

632
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,140
you feeling somebody on your staff if
they're here to the grounds

633
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,240
has the ability to me policy changes

634
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,390
on the fly say okay yesterday web was
sufficient today

635
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:04,230
it's not okay ramp to invest struck this
is

636
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:11,230
and nature surround less

637
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:17,038
link for your yeah arm

638
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,640
what can we do is people and consumers
about tarring

639
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,819
of RFID nothing

640
00:41:24,819 --> 00:41:28,170
nothing that can be done you could boy

641
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,630
call Walmart if they force that cuz

642
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,849
nobody shops at Walmart and I'm sure we
can all keep it

643
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,490
now can it like fifth-largest economy

644
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:43,309
inner I think

645
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:47,160
the depends what levels are for you talk
in there if you're talking about

646
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,390
like for instance when I get back going
forward car

647
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,740
from my bank yet and the decided to put
are you

648
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,349
debit card yet whether or not wanted
this is

649
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:03,700
you have a microwave yes I

650
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,039
that doesn't stop a hundred other people
for don't know what our fight

651
00:42:07,039 --> 00:42:10,500
is scarred

652
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,900
yes

653
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,759
the re suggestion was to invite them to
use your microwave

654
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:22,660
yes that's the best you got you know a
lot of the stuff to is

655
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,680
it's just getting pervasive

656
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,328
how many people dry force for for
related products

657
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:34,369
4x4's most popular vehicle US

658
00:42:34,369 --> 00:42:37,380
since 2004

659
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,240
I think keys are open RFID

660
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,650
transponder yes transponder in the key

661
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:49,680
and and that that is broke was based on
a forty bit

662
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,690
corruption writer yeah tape that was
broken

663
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,630
up to a year ago eighteen months ago

664
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:01,220
you can duplicate those keys on the fly

665
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,589
I think it's also this matter social
education catching up

666
00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:07,869
I mean up are fit is new

667
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:11,690
a lot of people don't even I mean I
don't wanna say everybody still

668
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,799
although I do often say that for

669
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:18,079
having a lot of people that go out by
cell phone

670
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:21,299
don't necessarily understand you know
how radio wave propagation networks and

671
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,230
we're expecting them to understand that

672
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,380
a little chip in their credit card to
the dangers to them I mean

673
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,359
it how long we've been talking about are
fed credit cards now maybe two years

674
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,400
telling the other three or four years
before you know there's enough

675
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:38,759
doom and gloom danger stories on media
to

676
00:43:38,759 --> 00:43:42,630
have that pickup mean we're still
getting restore now seeing stories about

677
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,270
how dangerous they have it dangerous it
is to have an unencrypted wireless

678
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,920
network

679
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,799
no about every two weeks some local news
station doesn't expose about

680
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:52,880
to get you know the local long haired
kid with a black teacher in the

681
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,630
neighborhood to drive them around

682
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,849
and terrified

683
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:02,200
got all the people to terrify all the
people in their town about the dangers

684
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,119
of an open wireless

685
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,460
we're still seeing that happening now

686
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:14,460
if he saying so in two years now so
happy RFID it

687
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:17,940
another aggregated notions nuisance yeah
to be

688
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,089
have been there I think we have another
question

689
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:25,078
so with the current configuration many
access points below their phone

690
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:25,970
abilities running

691
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:30,740
minutes what do you think we've not seen
a entirely AP based worm

692
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:36,559
this just exploding from wait for my two
from where environment

693
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,869
your goals that you have read my on talk
Avenue

694
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:44,240
yet we we actually about two years ago
came up with the perfect concept for

695
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:44,900
doing

696
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,759
that kind of thing and

697
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:54,319
its it's entirely possible that that
could happen

698
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,329
the there's a couple things that make it
a little bit more difficult

699
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:02,279
at least on the surface in that you
actually have to probably stop for a

700
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:03,289
couple minutes

701
00:45:03,289 --> 00:45:06,500
make connections you know

702
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:10,869
get get some transfer I we haven't seen
anything that would actually

703
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:14,640
go just drive down Road connecting
actually get

704
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,160
work to go cross now there's one thing
to say that if there wasn't an exploit

705
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,839
for one of these firmwares

706
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:24,400
me consumers upgrade the firmware points
is rather outside

707
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,809
one sitting box not a las if it ain't
broke don't fix it

708
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,910
people set password so yeah so that
exports

709
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:38,910
estimates

710
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,559
though the limitations of memories even
then

711
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,059
all you need to do is just sale tell
Matt or something like that better

712
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:51,589
this use no spam really or something
like that

713
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:55,200
as long as you still sizzling sis
Fernandes

714
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,440
everything's only city sorry sir

715
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,750
expires like how do you check there's

716
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,750
no method I know so for starsight
consumer here

717
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:08,609
you can't for your driving through
another machine and md5 sum things from

718
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:09,279
me

719
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:15,430
on the kernel at that point

720
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:18,919
reference to of people yes aren't

721
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,430
technically adept like just the random
person best lines

722
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,078
I want you know one notebook you know
got the wireless

723
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,730
you know neighboring home is known for
even know normal service

724
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:35,079
out there that good anyway do you think
the people that

725
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:39,279
technology is not a hobby to are gonna
catch on and say you know I

726
00:46:39,279 --> 00:46:43,430
you know this is only computer really
need you know look into the the manual

727
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:43,779
or

728
00:46:43,779 --> 00:46:47,299
into know what I'm doing on this is
going to affect

729
00:46:47,299 --> 00:46:51,849
you my finances you know anything about
my life is most people

730
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:56,420
in reference anything cars technology
they usually just use it as a tool

731
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,109
like a hammer and just throw back in the
box where you know if it's a hobby

732
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:03,900
ill tend to fall over you know the
problems of a certain technology in

733
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,440
of the traffic some I think has been the
bane

734
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,640
Texas distance for the beginning it's
getting people to read the freeman

735
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,290
it just thats was insurmountable
problems

736
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:20,700
making people aware they are personally
phone /url

737
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,210
this unfortunately Fox News seems to be

738
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,430
the King that this scaring day later

739
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:30,549
its historical city

740
00:47:30,549 --> 00:47:33,739
om I actually have to applaud Microsoft

741
00:47:33,739 --> 00:47:36,950
I say that when they were for using
hardware

742
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,059
wireless hardware their setup wizard
actually

743
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:45,040
you had to physically you had to click
and see no I don't want to use a weapon

744
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:48,569
so that little action not be

745
00:47:48,569 --> 00:47:52,670
open by default lets you quantum
networks being secure the probably

746
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,119
wouldn't have otherwise

747
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:57,329
that's not saying that people can just
turn it off anyways

748
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:00,359
it was leaving people down the right
path

749
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:04,250
that's where I think manufactures
intently steer the cattle

750
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:10,809
down this way you know I think also the
awareness is rising in general I mean a

751
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:14,230
five years ago how many people
downloaded l4d

752
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:18,140
I'm not not not a show of hands here i
mean in general many people downloadable

753
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,500
falling whole lot how many people are in
our and Trojans

754
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,859
probably not that many up now you watch
TV Citibank commercials are think

755
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:26,730
commercials

756
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:29,750
Citibank has identity theft recovery
services

757
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,339
earthlings talking about the Trojan
blockers antiviral stuff

758
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:35,739
I mean that reaches people they're
beginning to get more educated about

759
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:38,009
itself

760
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:41,230
I think the awareness what of that you
know

761
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:44,480
the average person would need to protect
themselves as rising I'll

762
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,140
I think they'll probably also be not
that many people necessarily targeting

763
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,670
the average person I mean I'll be the
guy

764
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,750
neighborhood needs internet doesn't want
to buy cable modem

765
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,809
will look for the next open access point
there may in the future be people who

766
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,140
right scrapers that goes the
neighborhood are like a worm activity or

767
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,359
something like that discreet personal
data but

768
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,500
majorly most people or that interesting
it's not worth breaking into their

769
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,000
computers

770
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,049
the threat comes when that becomes
automated spreads

771
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:16,349
and turns or something like that

772
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:19,520
couple things one as you mentioned

773
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,930
scar by

774
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,080
the firmware wireless device driver

775
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,230
is there any

776
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:34,470
way say for for instance next tact

777
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:37,540
that's worth should be what it is to

778
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,680
kismet or even a TCP don't filter once

779
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,830
the data becomes public if the package
is a is no

780
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:49,029
then I mean you ditch with it whatever
it is has to be in that packet

781
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,230
so if you're in monitor mode should be
able to sniff it very

782
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:56,760
some detector you could just to tease
the dumping graph food

783
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,680
time where you have to which is why

784
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,500
Wireless idea systems know in some issue
you think

785
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,810
configuration of

786
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,009
K is there Magin

787
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,540
I would think that the configuration
which means way

788
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,770
not guarantee my research was and if
your teeth

789
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,340
forties all of their settings channel a
society

790
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,140
errol's for the RAM which survives
during laugh

791
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,319
so as far as user sees

792
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,540
at three o'clock in the morning there
rather pickups 0

793
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,300
now it's back same SSID seems all thing
looks

794
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,410
the same yeah I i've

795
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,700
I've reflashed lot of devices over the
years

796
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,130
I haven't seen one actually had to go
back program society

797
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,270
change it all stays so

798
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:55,759
if that becomes a real possibility

799
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,010
I don't see use end-user

800
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,850
was relatively clueless about it be
tipped off because

801
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,950
the fact that something change wall
suppose

802
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,430
and if they didn't set a password do you
think they're gonna notes

803
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:14,420
change the channel if it still wants
associate society

804
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,740
I get something at one point comment

805
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:22,280
amazing me organizations actually use
Wireless default ask for

806
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,580
an excuse its key parts organization I
seen 1x user data center

807
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,870
had a wireless access point two miles to
where their

808
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:33,400
of his and it was amazing an overall

809
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,690
win over told over anymore basic grad
any other key

810
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:39,900
including basic breaking up there what's

811
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,370
actually i've seen sexy quite often

812
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,520
now when I used to do so it's just
amazing

813
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,640
user actually I believe there's a talk
tomorrow that fact covers

814
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,430
that exactly can we have time for

815
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,540
one or maybe two questions if the quick
just

816
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:03,870
the comment as first calling if you're
for or spin actor for the wrt54g is

817
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,490
if you're running if the link sister

818
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:10,610
X for Myer's for example bertie

819
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:14,720
you can compile and run a sire sign
which is the firmware

820
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,060
post integrity monitor but that of
course only applies if you're

821
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,290
technically savvy

822
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:23,279
care enough to watch in the first place
which case you're probably

823
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,890
be exploited there but only if it does
get own how would you check it because

824
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:29,250
you can't look at it

825
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:32,720
directly you can't for the driving
examiner something that's not booting

826
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:36,770
the kernel that's potentially old mall
or sisal

827
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,410
do so go through an actual do that the
5's take some rights

828
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:43,649
if the only way to do that would be to
get the file

829
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:46,870
from the machine over SEP were served by
the kernel that maybe own

830
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:49,940
or to get the file locally sir but a
kernel that may be old

831
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,800
which may like if you just going to a
configuration utility in looking at

832
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,300
boxes

833
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,960
the check some fear for firmware is or
its gonna hurt

834
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,670
easy to put every Alexis reelection
chances you've got a server and client

835
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:04,330
points

836
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:08,040
the service got known hashes actually
checks

837
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,240
yet from things after I guess

838
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,570
levees turner's is looking of

839
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,970
toward suffered Cyrus and

840
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:21,310
like like I said if you that
sophisticated you're probably not be

841
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:23,040
worried about that in the first place

842
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,370
gonna be that part is now running Lexus
care

843
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:29,660
if I think that's about it for our time

844
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,940
will be around the plants
