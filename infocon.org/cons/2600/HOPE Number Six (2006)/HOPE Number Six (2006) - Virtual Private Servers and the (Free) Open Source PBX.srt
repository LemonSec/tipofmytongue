1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,729
ran just run Jan to you or Windows you
have to patch it

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:07,839
to work with is an which which is a

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,839
example parimutuel ice machine this is
the one that I

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,509
personal use and its OS level
virtualization

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,630
OS level virtualization engines we
designed it

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,930
instead the other two to

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,300
be more secure isolate the data and

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,560
on process is better and

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,530
therefore making even more secure two
examples have this

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,690
is esther berger for good

11
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,449
call but SW soft virtuoso

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,090
and in the next me sir virtuosos
proprietary

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,120
and that's what most other VP S
providers if

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,760
been on the internet your Google Ads you
you've probably seen a lot of

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,960
as for them on that's when most venues I
use Win XP sarin

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,510
can be talking more about that act

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,798
and as I said it's an example a-list
level

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,229
virtualization so

19
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,639
ok the next three server provides
virtual aviation for

20
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:18,859
only Linex sis lennox operating systems

21
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,279
so Mikes and I might Microsoft Virtual
Server

22
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:26,359
you can only run this and Mannix and you
can on the run it with an ex

23
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:29,729
virtual private servers inside key

24
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:33,920
if okay this

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,479
environment unlike the others are used
the same

26
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,319
colonel for all the different PPS is
which

27
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,380
therefore limited to only Mannix

28
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:50,060
operating systems and it's kind of like
ch fruit which is

29
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:54,529
complicate I won't go but

30
00:01:54,529 --> 00:01:58,319
okay and in this environment

31
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,560
as I said unlike the others it
guarantees

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,009
more securely and unit utilizes
resources more efficiently

33
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:12,370
which %uh times

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,060
so in for benefits and specific things
for Guardian

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,140
an XP server I might Microsoft Virtual
Server

36
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,310
lawn XVI server is built-in to colonel
an

37
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,609
on you have to patch the current on
their host and

38
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:31,150
once you do that there's really no
Damon's running other than the virtual

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,450
private servers themselves

40
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,840
so it therefore uses less

41
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,650
overhead and on everything will run much
faster

42
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,639
also you don't need a pre allocate disk
space for each

43
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,019
virtual private servers so like

44
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,599
in is an if you wanna make bps for
someone that's

45
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,548
that their name is to Gigabyte's you ft
she'd

46
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,129
on the host you cannot use that to
Gigabyte's its

47
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:05,450
allocated to just that for UPS and no
one else can use it in this environment

48
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,040
you can

49
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,209
use LVM to limit to space but

50
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,099
with buttoned

51
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,810
this piece will be if available to
anyone

52
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,139
and there's no limit so if someone
doesn't use other space someone else can

53
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:21,720
use it

54
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,930
on this as long as it's within their own
minutes

55
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,650
also another

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:33,120
benefit to this is you can make mix and
match different

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
Linux distributions I'm sell for example

58
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,299
I have people running a Gentoo VP S
which is a managed distribution

59
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:46,530
I daddy NVP S&S Center last bps

60
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,659
on the same physical server as opposed
to just running

61
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,948
and regular server environment just
running read her

62
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:57,979
just running Debbie inner just running
Gentoo having have multiple

63
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:02,870
physical servers to do that also in this
environment you can

64
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,930
update V servers independent me

65
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,400
Mike standard server environment so

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,099
if you familiar with Jen to you are dead
be in the user

67
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:16,509
tree for package management so in this
way

68
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:22,139
I can not allocate space for each party
Jer deadly entry I can have one tree

69
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,860
for the whole server and everyone can
share to

70
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,229
save space and safe time also with this
you can eat run

71
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,659
a 64-bit processor but use 32

72
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:37,310
and 64-bit I'm operating systems

73
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,430
which many the other engines cannot use

74
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,380
also

75
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,099
we shall touch in times on the year
security is a major factor in this

76
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:49,080
technique so

77
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,010
in this technique everything's Eisley
its of iffy servers hacked

78
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:59,659
or cracked or something the host server
which is the main server that is running

79
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,700
on XP servers

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,779
can and trade and fix it but someone who
hacked into the

81
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:09,700
the server cannot get into other
people's

82
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,150
data K

83
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,400
so improve security so let's say you
have a server running

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,169
now my sequel Apache

85
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:25,270
a DNS server and asterisk now

86
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,510
there's at least five different
applications listening to their never

87
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,719
questioned listening to the data at once

88
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:35,550
and you then can contain security holes
with this method where you can do

89
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,860
is point each application into a

90
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,360
virtual private server so if one gets
cracked or hacked into

91
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,449
I'm not everything else is compromised
so

92
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,469
if asterisk as a whole and it gets
cracked

93
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:57,469
then the database is still running now

94
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,430
server consolidation this is also great
thing to use virtual private servers for

95
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,930
in a okay so

96
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,930
in a data center let's say you have
three different servers

97
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,589
where you can and though it increases
availability

98
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:21,560
availability in improve security to have
multiple servers just in case one goes

99
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,089
down

100
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:26,199
or something gets cracked it also
increases the Casa hardware

101
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:29,870
and space to come locator dedicate your
servers

102
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,099
so a solution to this is a creative EPS
for each application

103
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,110
so thank ice and the other in the other
example you have a

104
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,589
PPS just for my sequel bps just for
Asterisk

105
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:46,519
one for Apache and you can from them off
simultaneously

106
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,729
transparently so if one gets cracked

107
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,310
not everything else gets compromised by

108
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,310
you still have the

109
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,570
security are you still have the

110
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,919
isolation have multiple physical servers
and if you have questions hang time

111
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,010
I'll be happy to explain any basic
questions

112
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:16,010
regarding this and now

113
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:23,010
okay will he do

114
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,030
well I mean to that too

115
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,210
units are I'm and

116
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:37,210
now will be the next benefit right now
so

117
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,480
another benefit this is deploying
service rapidly so let's say

118
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,400
you have multiple servers

119
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,260
you've just even just for one just for
Apache and stuff

120
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,010
so you have multiple Apache servers but
one goes down

121
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,420
if you're running WinXP sir on multiple
servers we can do you can just

122
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,710
copy one the server to another somewhat
act right away

123
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,740
and you can run Apache right there and

124
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,430
it just goes up on a Mac the

125
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,430
and it won't it just you can rapidly
deploy

126
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:21,009
the servers

127
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:24,600
K is also good for development intestine

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,300
environment so if you test if you're an
application like

129
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,700
I a script from an ex or

130
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,719
ice an application on

131
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,089
week usually need a test and multiple
operating systems and multiple the next

132
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:40,909
distributions

133
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:44,800
make sure compiles in Gentoo make sure
compiles and Red Hat

134
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,230
are the other next issue missions with
this you can run multiple

135
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,150
VP S is with multiple the next issue
bution and

136
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,410
so you can test it in Once Upon berman
you can also

137
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,829
use different kinda hardware with this
almost anything

138
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,070
you can run a Linux server on you can
physicals

139
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,540
hardware i'm talking about. you can run
an XP server on

140
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:15,140
okay so performance wise as opposed to

141
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,689
Microsoft as opposed to Microsoft
Virtual Server or is an

142
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,640
on I love the same are the GPS is you
seem

143
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,500
colonel so in it increases performance

144
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,339
so not everything is using its own thing
and everything's

145
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,050
being processed differently everything's
pretty much filters through

146
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,050
the main kernel which everyone shares
that makes sense

147
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,459
think

148
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:52,459
sure

149
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,460
okay yesterday Fetsch GPS uses the same
colonel reach

150
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,310
for it if each GPS uses the host colonel
attacker

151
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,000
okay there colonel is on the host in the
VP esters know colonel

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,990
and this method so everything runs of
the same kernel which

153
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,370
essential ice on the host Sam

154
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:22,370
answer question

155
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,089
right in this scenario

156
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,480
as I said I can run multiple
distributions everyone uses the same

157
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,060
colonel

158
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,570
when you install an XP server part of
the installation is patching the house

159
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,430
kernel which

160
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,800
makes it more in general and for the
most part everyone's colonels the same

161
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,490
as a post in minor changes and versions
so

162
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:05,200
for example on my server everyone

163
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,830
running whether they're running Gentoo
Debian Red Hat they're all using

164
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:15,830
two points 6.1 for any other questions
before I start demonstration

165
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:23,070
yet that's where you be did as well

166
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,160
when you mean

167
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,510
there's a dress ability

168
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,950
32-bit a two gig levitation

169
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,330
32-bit operating I think use your 32g
there are 32 gig 32

170
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,510
32 byte machine there's a limitation to
get address ability

171
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,000
is overcome that or I

172
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,720
try and figure out how to mix and match
32bit 64bit operations

173
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,900
well you to be alright 64-bit our asking
you to be run on 64-bit hardware

174
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,290
right so if you're running a 32-bit OS
on

175
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,969
64-bit hardware there's no problems you
know just run through are you still

176
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,190
you still have to take into account the
32-bit addressing

177
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,180
limitation George can you address over
to if Iran 232 but

178
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,630
virtual machine can address over 2
gigabytes right yes

179
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,710
that passed in the current yeah

180
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:33,300
I'm if also virtual servers running

181
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,810
on the same colonel arm dan

182
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:41,550
how do you prevent and a successful
exploit against one of them

183
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:45,600
dead involves the kernel from thereby

184
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,170
being an ass play against all of them
simultaneously so if there's an exploit

185
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,400
for their hosts colonel

186
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,960
you're right every PPS would be affected

187
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,070
I suppose if they can gain access to the
host

188
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,620
the main server they can

189
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,840
access all the difference you

190
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:11,840
your questions

191
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:18,649
okay so one other thing I like to dress
for going to colonel for example IP

192
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:19,529
tables have

193
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,419
which is like a firewall application you
can run inside

194
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,989
bps because it needs access directly to

195
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:30,419
some part the kernel where you need it
but you'd have to do you

196
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,478
is running on that host which

197
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,160
the main server and down pay your

198
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,509
IP table frozen their thats the main
issue

199
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:44,119
okay so

200
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:47,850
and the questions I can address

201
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,549
okay so I'd also like to talk about

202
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:55,149
asterisk which seems to be the big hype
in a lot of on

203
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,989
there's a and a lot of questions about
in I'll sees asterisk on a daily basis

204
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:00,539
so I can

205
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,109
answer any questions you have on
asterisk is

206
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,160
open source PB axo if you've ever used
like

207
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,689
novell or Cisco's car manager

208
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:16,169
no now with the caller I

209
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,478
Nortel is arm if you very ever use

210
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:23,779
their PBX it's our proprietary it's hard
to scripting Jan

211
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,669
it's hard to add new extensions and the
firmware on

212
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,959
their IP phones are proprietary in
astor's keys all open source

213
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,559
and you can you everything you can do in
a

214
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:40,108
Cisco for Nortel PBX is

215
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:43,279
and customizing more so

216
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,199
I guess I'll just damn about if you like

217
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,829
and so and I have I have after straining
perfect running

218
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,419
and I V PS me thing

219
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:04,419
yankee

220
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:19,570
month

221
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,620
performance in what sense

222
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,620
yeah

223
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,670
okay

224
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,910
yeah I'm like not going to be a jerk and
not use the mic

225
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,800
so suppose that I want to use your
approach

226
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,040
love isolating my applications which I
do think is actually a good

227
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,050
I don't want my sequel server to get
around if there's you know

228
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,640
bike in some you know CGI application

229
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,590
morning under Apache my concern is
apaches

230
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,340
really slow its way slower than I ass
anyway

231
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,400
and if I run it underneath this PPS
technology

232
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,750
is it going to be even more slow or is
it going to run roughly as quickly

233
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,330
as if I work running that application
with an iffy yes

234
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,340
lbs poster hardware so

235
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,850
if the main issue would be memory
probably

236
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,980
so actually on if

237
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,040
my my concern is more comparative right
so if I wore

238
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,260
running CIA assets equal on one machine

239
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,340
both in the context

240
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,040
I love running them in separate UPS's
verses

241
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,810
running them both on the same machine
without any UPS's

242
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:56,540
while the overall performance using the
PS approach

243
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,800
be slower then faster than or the same

244
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,890
as if I were to stack both applications
in the same instance if the OS

245
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,030
okay so you don't generally be

246
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:10,670
exactly the same assuming you have
available resources on

247
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,190
the host to the main server so as far as
my mines

248
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:20,550
Microsoft sequel server well no no I'm
not using my other sites equal server as

249
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,879
an example cuz I wouldn't be running my
ass

250
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,430
and Microsoft sequel server under 1x
obviously but

251
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,560
on if I'm trying to make the business
case for using

252
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,850
Apache and say my sequel verses

253
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,209
um I A S and Microsoft sequel
performance is going to be a pretty big

254
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,170
consideration

255
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,660
right so this technology gives me more
security but it doesn't cost me in terms

256
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,770
of performance

257
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,480
right right it doesn't cost them finna
catch a man on that

258
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,890
though Linux operating system works more
like a

259
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,410
turmoil services and everything's times
placed so every single piece gets a

260
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,610
it's a piece of the processor in in a
row

261
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,160
so it just continues to go right where

262
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,320
a so it's more like running terms

263
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,510
Apache gets a %uh a piece of the
operating system

264
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,050
and something else gets is the operating
system you know are the kernel

265
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:22,050
indexes keeps processor chips lacy

266
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,570
right yes frees up another couple
questions I

267
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,139
now um one is we guarding

268
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,320
SEO e-cards resources that all the
sovereign system to try and share

269
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,210
um one of them would be I guess things
like cash thrashing

270
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,240
arm optimizations

271
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,750
for hard drive reads managing do with
caching and continuous

272
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,890
verses scattered reading of data

273
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,590
I'm having everything running undertone
VPN

274
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:07,169
with Dad mean that each thing getting it
on times

275
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,590
place would be switching up things

276
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:14,409
and reducing performance my other
question would be:

277
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:18,660
regarding things like IP connectivity

278
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,770
with each of these virtual servers have
its own IP address

279
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:26,480
and have with the talk to each other
through the host somehow

280
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,970
so are just I'm not exactly sure we mean
on the first question

281
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:38,150
as fires the okay

282
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,510
as far as you can aka

283
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:48,510
ca

284
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,210
okay

285
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,730
so for IP's each

286
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,570
V server virtual private server can have
it has to have its own IP

287
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,790
whether it's external or internal

288
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,990
it doesn't matter and if you give each
one in internal IP

289
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:12,340
yes they can talk to each other in I'm
are the data got through the host

290
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:19,340
and safety pin

291
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,659
so just demo with astor's

292
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,129
which you can in

293
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:37,129
EPS environment

294
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,260
so not gonna go over the

295
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,660
Symantec's the syntax for virtual
private servers

296
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,530
one doing is just entering sir

297
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,710
starring astor's so

298
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,690
when I set up usually spend

299
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:03,690
BC I

300
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:14,539
now

301
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:29,090
that tuner help much

302
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:36,910
she said

303
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:42,020
yes I'm I enter the GPS WiFi server in
the BPS name

304
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,510
intentar okay and then every and the
actors console

305
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,780
to get into which would be Asher's minus
are

306
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,460
so I condemn or anything by with pastors

307
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,920
by are tell you how to do it by are just

308
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,280
I ever have a quick question

309
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:04,290
mind maybe an honest and yes I thought
that you said the dues

310
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,730
absolutely no performance decrease with
running

311
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,380
virtual private servers is now it's
always the same

312
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,830
you

313
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,480
okay so it I okay so five

314
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,580
if you have say a server and I

315
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,100
its serving dynamic web pages base

316
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:31,480
you know web server whatever it is okay
mega serve up

317
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,610
X amount pages and hardware I can then
run

318
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:38,660
any number virtual servers and it seems
hardware

319
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,020
and serve up that c'mon web pages

320
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,320
there would be no loss with there's no
overhead

321
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,090
for money any there's UPS's yes there's
a small

322
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:53,129
overhead very small in and you're in
pain I'm pretty much more than if you

323
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,880
just had one

324
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,890
server right okay effect from many
servers on one server so

325
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,920
yes you small overhead I okay I just its

326
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,730
I thought you said it is nine it's
almost not

327
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:07,910
that's okay graduates he said not

328
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,690
yep ok so

329
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,050
just to show up quick demo when I did
for hope was

330
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,270
I finding T-eighty retract inward I'll
few

331
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,720
coming into asterisk and a just gonna
show how

332
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,890
back and work in hey can route calls
whenever

333
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,530
few astor's have an inbound to go out
found

334
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:33,710
if you have questions about Astor's kind
52 answer

335
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:40,710
now

336
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:55,200
know that

337
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,399
K

338
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,910
20

339
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,490
ok okay so

340
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:12,330
just a quick demo when I did was I went
out by Nov one hundred the ID so

341
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,210
for example an application for Asterisk
would be you don't wanna get out your

342
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:16,630
real

343
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:23,630
cell phone numbers so you coming okay

344
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,770
when the provider I use I can choose if
I want it to you

345
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,980
except call from payphone and yes there
is a like any

346
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,710
like any a hundred there's a surcharge
for calling

347
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,320
countries it would show them

348
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,530
said servers on register to but

349
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:50,200
I'm not registered to save so and
calling my 180 for example I could give

350
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,480
this

351
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,480
out to anyone here so

352
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,150
I don't have to give them my your cell
phone number and through this they can

353
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,880
call me

354
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,910
they can down extension want it picks up

355
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,770
and down my cell phone so I don't have
to give them my cell phone number but

356
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:05,780
they can still reach me

357
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:11,690
anti-religious

358
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,400
see the activity won't make much sense
you

359
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,620
sound impressed nine to calm myself

360
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,080
which myself found and you can see
myself

361
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,379
find yet on okay

362
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:37,640
Sam an hour

363
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,030
doing whole music farrakhan's my cell
phone its

364
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,080
so can fear by it's calling me

365
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,230
cell if I pick up I can have

366
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:55,230
again

367
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,480
so which is a qualification for Asterisk

368
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,669
I'm through this I could also down and
call out so I don't have to use a

369
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:06,510
payphone

370
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,750
are conquered and I don't have to use
five cents a minute

371
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:13,299
kind heart and I can doubt through
asterisk and

372
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:17,639
for like two cents in cheap

373
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,470
to and any general questions or anything

374
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,470
okay so from only run

375
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,250
as I said security isolation

376
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:39,690
I GS so

377
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,450
so

378
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,799
the benefit of running at I'm runnin
asterisk on average private server

379
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,929
is Security Act isolated so if there's a
whole

380
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:57,520
it won't get to my my Siebel Server and
if someone hacks asterisk

381
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,600
you can call it on it won't compromise

382
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,010
mine databases on also I can have
multiple

383
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:07,840
UPS is running on once a physical server
so I can have

384
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,610
much for servers right my multiple after
service running on the same physical

385
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:13,130
server

386
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,720
with different settings compiled with
different directories for the

387
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,860
configuration it sir because asterisk

388
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,309
for the full benefit it has to run as
root so

389
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,408
this multiple impairments got a question
for you

390
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,640
sure %ah see got that four rings your
cell phone soon have to do with the

391
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,059
number

392
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:35,220
so frances could I A for listing numbers
in

393
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,330
in Asterix and say these people

394
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:42,178
automatically go to my cell phone and if
it's not on that list then it says the

395
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,309
numbers on services on

396
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,639
yeah you could write II you using the
syntax for ASR she could do that

397
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,000
you could have it check Canadian if it's

398
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,100
in this database surf its the in this
array4

399
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,350
list div color ID's then go to your cell
phone if not say

400
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,490
press one to leave a message to hang up

401
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:08,020
and so you can also do our caller ID
spoofing I think with masters right

402
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:15,020
rate depending on that no

403
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,559
did depending on that termination
outgoing

404
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,119
to the public switched telephone number
provider use you can

405
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:25,460
so you defended the have then I guess

406
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,629
the way did the ID the d80 is a direct
inward out so that coming

407
00:28:30,629 --> 00:28:34,580
into your server work depends on caller
ID spoofing is what you sent

408
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,158
out so AT&T would be a region 18

409
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,710
to the server and coming out spoofing
your CAD would be terminating

410
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,509
to public switched telephone network or
an IP phone

411
00:28:47,509 --> 00:28:51,460
excuse me

412
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,970
0 website or take a direct us to

413
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,470
setting up the PS I shared some

414
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,289
the application I uses an XP server I'm

415
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,299
Tim there's they have a website I am

416
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:13,029
next SP server dot word I'm

417
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:17,100
so you can go in the next session the
server now Arghandab engineered how to

418
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,489
100 set up this

419
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:22,980
on the basic steps are you download the
current you

420
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,799
patching kernel on UNIX operating system

421
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,830
and then you installed the tools to make
the binary files for it the

422
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,109
I'm for the commands so you can

423
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:39,279
enter the PS created the PF on those

424
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,879
so the next SP serve readout forgive
their main website

425
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:47,090
and a they ever have to for almost any
operating system

426
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,440
or you can just got their generic one im
be

427
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:57,440
pretty much the same for anything yet
tell a freak

428
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:00,960
roan article specifically I'm not
running

day of grozny believe and John brody

432
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,809
about making PPS is specifically
