1
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:06,430
and

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,760
arrival as if you're just joining us
welcome to day to have hope the next

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,090
panel is our

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,520
wireless security flaws are and i three
panelists here

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,890
have swapped numbers so

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,949
oMG what you do on weekends is for your
own business

7
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,349
com I 109 20 and 32

8
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,720
other numbers on we have

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,510
Raven Arikan Brandon and I'm

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:40,480
aren't you guys going to get started

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,920
how's everyone doing got coffee caffeine
%ah

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,890
alright so a this story begins simply

13
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,250
a Raven friend and myself %uh

14
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,430
have this the incident where we were

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,540
driving all over the place looking at
packets and we found some

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:06,490
disturbing thing so the net result is we
decided to

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,039
look a little deeper look beneath the
covers and see where we have their so

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,770
um we're going to present some our
findings what

19
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:18,149
we believe to be some not serious flaws
in

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,750
the way people and for many things and
we're going to show some

21
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,960
some packing done since and some taos
justice

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,190
self starring Ralph friend alright

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:36,190
York

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,360
right as many you may be aware it's been

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,740
made trivially easy to go out for
driving for the past few years

26
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,830
I prices have dropped on various
products

27
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:52,250
technology is of it's working out pretty
well I think we're all

28
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,500
also pretty aware %uh how bad
transferring

29
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,330
informational booklet or clear text is
it's a

30
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,030
if you have any concerns about any sort
of privacy or security

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:08,130
probably don't want to be doing that
however

32
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,730
we found and we we also believe that a
lot of up for a call architects and

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,890
system designers

34
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,170
remains somewhat clueless I regarding
sniffing and security

35
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,989
specifically they make bad assumptions
like well

36
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:25,770
we don't need worry about security
because the firewall take care of it

37
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,020
or writers actually physically locked up
so no one could possibly get to it and

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,600
changing your configs or really do any
sort of bad things to our network

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:40,570
thoughts well that's just not tire leak
case

40
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,640
but no one is that downright well that
are true that I guess we

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,910
this would be a pretty short
presentation we have captured this

42
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,840
of

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,040
so we have a fair amount captures dating
all the way back to

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,230
%uh 2002 and its

45
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,280
British damning evidence that there's a
lot of problems seria

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,090
traffic captures from my several
different metro areas in the United

47
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,000
States

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,769
and a an important thing to note was
that all these captures

49
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,310
were basically sent to us by volunteers
and

50
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,819
we want actually trying to target %uh

51
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,700
network infrastructure this was just
random to go out

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,180
around the city a little bit see what we
can find so

53
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,730
the fact that we did find a lot of very
bad things relating to

54
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:38,730
running protocols being transferred over
wireless as a little more frightening

55
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,970
so year we have they have map just
showing some data that was collected in

56
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,390
our hometown of Seattle

57
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,930
as you can see there's quite a bit of
driving around

58
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,750
and a downtown area and for some reason

59
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,160
some people decided to drive out East I
guess maybe there's

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,370
something interesting out where they
might that they might find some

61
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,330
interesting information

62
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,030
but

63
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:09,370
so why are we here %ah sure most to view
of probably heard the old fable of the

64
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,920
emperor's new clothes

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,510
and essentially at the very end of the
story

66
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,290
patch it takes a child to stand up and
say the guys wearing any clothes

67
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,960
state the obvious and we are that child

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,030
so there about five things that we are
really gonna focus on here

69
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,130
and at first which is a network
infrastructure information disclosure

70
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,240
annex opportunities for our authentic 8
infrastructure denial of service

71
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,510
broadcasts cover it for calls to
cooperate

72
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,270
which corporate without authentication

73
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,219
input validation is not important

74
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,080
fully trusting rotting and national
protocols you probably don't want rogue

75
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,570
networks being attached announced

76
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,070
propagating across wrong new employees
design small management for calls

77
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,840
is responsible by pretty much anyone
with a pack crafting and Jen

78
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,560
five minutes and Google so finally

79
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,880
now the main point wanna say here is
that really you gotta

80
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,510
stop the madness right take
responsibility in

81
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,219
take your stuff

82
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,430
a so the first thing here is a Cisco
discovery protocol

83
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,290
CP it's very chatty required for such a
lovely cancellations

84
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,740
and it basically advertisers information
about your device

85
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,020
as well as possibly what version love

86
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,880
Iowa see a running under and genocide
information a whopping transmitted over

87
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,620
wireless

88
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,340
that's definitely not information that
You wats say people like

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,730
Eric here you looking at in his car

90
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,650
so again basically is used for a
troubleshooting

91
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,830
and really not troubleshooting it should
be turned off

92
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,270
and unfortunately a lot of network
administrators forget to do this

93
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,570
so now they have devices are very chatty

94
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,480
advertising information over wireless
that voice should be talking and so

95
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:15,900
what we have here is a

96
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,960
Smith from Asian being transferred and
what I want to emphasize here's all the

97
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,378
packet captures a we're out we're
showing here

98
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:26,370
Israel captured over wireless track you
know Cup someone's router and just start

99
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,039
how capturing packets these are all text
over wireless

100
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:33,240
so as you can see we have a

101
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,460
3600 the em all the router

102
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,169
as well as the overseer ViaWest it's
running on it not good it's

103
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:44,938
truly easy to just type into Google and
look for exports relating to

104
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:50,609
the actual router or the operating
system

105
00:06:50,609 --> 00:06:55,188
and structure information disclosure or
a wireless management traffic

106
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,539
tends to or have quite a large
monologues

107
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,419
a good example of this I'm sure everyone
is aware I was the venerable

108
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:08,359
widely deployed syslog formations
usually sent out using an accredited you

109
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:08,939
DP

110
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,069
and relieving the most common versions
almost anyone to read it

111
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:16,399
so you just like data to disclose

112
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,839
crucial enterprise data cleaning device
versions like you're just talking about

113
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:24,419
cept or not actually that but

114
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,869
now basically information relating
specifically to your network setup that

115
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:29,349
you don't want other people to know
about

116
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:32,688
so device versions state errors

117
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,559
account credentials PIII and then
attacks

118
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,209
attack tracking and remediation so if
you have an IDS reply all set up on

119
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:40,639
their

120
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,509
you definitely don't want that
announcing everything that it's too much

121
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:45,389
on the clear

122
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:48,999
to everyone so

123
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:53,119
really it's particularly tragic one
security information is being broadcast

124
00:07:53,119 --> 00:07:57,099
in the clear or wireless allowing an
attacker

125
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:01,219
basically watch responses to everything
that they're doing makes their job

126
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:05,659
just a little bit easier and these
people were really weren't doing a very

127
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:07,049
good job with this

128
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:11,059
so now as you can see there's some

129
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,319
information being transferred here
regarding at packets are being dropped

130
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,639
by their firewall

131
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,539
Haasan of the upward sections here how
we wanted to

132
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:23,878
now be nice and everyone out to really
reckon a business urs or

133
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,339
corporations so we've learned out no key
points the IP addresses so that people

134
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,169
could go out looking for them everything
RFC 1918 we left to learn

135
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,978
anything that you see blurred was an
actual internet address they

136
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,939
you can reach so I was really excited
when I started seeing

137
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:47,230
syslog across wireless I mean you can
pour ce can someone

138
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,329
and see all the ports that are being
blocked him what's getting through i

139
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,819
mean that's that's pretty exciting

140
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,529
cell ass from attackers perspective that
level information disclosure is

141
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,889
a really a fairly sensitive so

142
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:03,689
I'm obviously you know having a

143
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:07,240
having syslog broadcast across the
wireless link is is a bad thing

144
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,080
sergeant it left

145
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,279
just stupid information disclosure or
wireless

146
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,600
we couldn't believe this one at me
thought it was fairly obvious to

147
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,790
everyone by now that

148
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,870
some data is just should not be
transferred over wireless

149
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,690
say example for like your tax
information %ah

150
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:33,700
a lot of other stuff like social
security numbers credit card information

151
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,100
anything financial help especially
anything that

152
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,610
anyone might find valuable probably
shouldn't be at Facebook Wireless

153
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,539
especially for text

154
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,049
so here we have it it may be hard to see
in the back

155
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:54,098
but the highlighted areas says state tax
in the clear its

156
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:58,499
a database file so this is a single
server traffic

157
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:03,129
so there you go what what they were
doing with these tables in the structure

158
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:05,349
is far less to chair match nations

159
00:10:05,349 --> 00:10:10,029
so

160
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:14,469
or services building up from the least
says only release yes that was the least

161
00:10:14,469 --> 00:10:18,869
at section to worse and worse and
management and

162
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:22,529
similar traffic that we saw over
wireless and

163
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:25,849
for those you may have seen this before

164
00:10:25,849 --> 00:10:29,189
attend to talk about network design and
engineering have done a bunch background

165
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:32,259
stuff he used to work in eyes keys
before moving into security

166
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:37,729
and one of the reasons that I left was I
got ticked off that the

167
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:41,259
others failure as I S p's to really care
about

168
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,709
these sorts of attacks so I think

169
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:49,139
after six get it last summer daycare a
little more and that's improving but

170
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,819
there's still a lot of very stupid
traffic out there

171
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,238
and with increasing deployment of
wireless networks we're seeing things

172
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,519
that were intended

173
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,609
to only be done in data centers sent out
to everyone

174
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:03,879
and this opens up just unprecedented
opportunities for

175
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,159
network manipulations and I'll services
at Art Center so

176
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,839
just a reiterate our main point none
other stuff should ever be seen over

177
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:11,669
wireless

178
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:15,779
so let's talk about protocols that are
designed for high availability

179
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,939
you see this in most major networks
anyone on CL 59 at that time they're

180
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,019
gonna have some sort it is

181
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,089
set up for redundancy and a lot of the
time

182
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,639
they have protocols like ages are perv
RRP that are designed to

183
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,399
provide this these protocols on a wired
network

184
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,349
normally just connect these two devices
that are supposed to be redundant for

185
00:11:35,349 --> 00:11:37,799
each other with the crossover cable and
they send their little

186
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,489
heartbeat okay are you alive I'm alive
he's got the IP address

187
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:45,109
I've got the IP address that and forth
between themselves but

188
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:49,929
increasingly we're seeing that traffic
not limited to you noticed rates and hug

189
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:50,669
or

190
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,589
a crossover cable between those boxes
were see it go out over the main

191
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:56,709
networking often get rebroadcast over
wireless

192
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:02,369
this is that so let's look at it

193
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,609
HSRP and the RPM particular if you don't
have a device

194
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:10,139
on the network segment that is actively
using this for failover

195
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:14,359
you really shouldn't see it just limited
to communication between the two devices

196
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,389
that are doing it

197
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:19,569
don't send it out to a jail and and
unfortunately people

198
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:23,118
are really getting this and we have caps
now I know there's going to be someone

199
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,179
in the back it was going to say wait
wait there's authentication

200
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:29,589
there's a password you can lock this
down there's a password

201
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,659
in cleartext fantastic that will really
help

202
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,949
next so

203
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,729
here said packet capture the HSRP that
we did see in the wild

204
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:44,069
over wireless and you can see that they
are using authentication is it's very

205
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:45,549
proper it's got the default

206
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:48,929
love cisco is the password which ensure
no one would ever guess

207
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:54,309
so if anyone spots their own networks in
these captures just raise your head okay

208
00:12:54,309 --> 00:13:01,309
will help you fix that relations and
here's the RPV other major redundancy

209
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:04,449
protocol you see this one on a lot of
firewalls and they'll use that for

210
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:05,149
failover

211
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:09,129
and once again you can see the version
you can see the

212
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,069
authentication strain which we have
taken out at the headers because it was

213
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:14,079
in the default works

214
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,470
ever so slightly nice well okay I'm nice
their evil I

215
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,639
and it would

216
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,029
just very appalling alright

217
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,929
so you have really bad stuff not only
are people

218
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:33,358
using never done is a failover traffic
not only are they telling you what

219
00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:36,699
version A via West they're running it
also is it sensitive internal

220
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:37,459
information

221
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,519
but they're also announcing their
routing protocols to everyone

222
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,679
over wireless genius now

223
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,709
%uh we saw this ranging from 2002 when I
first captures came from

224
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:54,539
up until captures from last week so this
is not an old problem the people have

225
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,470
gotten over this is still going on

226
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,829
and its only get dumber every major
urban area that we look at had this

227
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,419
problem it wasn't like you know

228
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:07,999
only in Silicon Valley do they do this
or anything this is endemic in

229
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,470
it said system wide problem for the most
part

230
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,759
the study protocols that we saw were
OSTs Eddie IGRP was at dribs and drabs

231
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,009
about the things but

232
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,339
predominately this is the most popular
internal routing protocols

233
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,449
now for the

234
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:28,470
mostly bad but not god-awful you can
gather information about the routing

235
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,149
structure that network too here their
wedding announcement says

236
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:34,939
you know just how it works at the very
least you're gonna hear okay here's the

237
00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:36,649
device is looking for neighbors

238
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:42,439
hears it I P address here's the protocol
it speaking in what version that is

239
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:46,748
but the obvious attack vector here is to
set up your own little router

240
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:51,399
and join their network and when you
start speaking routing protocol to these

241
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,269
boxes

242
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,709
you know a lot of the time either there
is no authentication or there's a thank

243
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:57,209
%eh in in the clear again

244
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,489
and so it's very easy I mean the way
that many these protocols were

245
00:15:01,489 --> 00:15:05,209
is they advertising discover their own
neighbors and whenever you've got that

246
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:05,929
going on

247
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:09,720
can say ok why yes I and your neighbor

248
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,799
would you like to you about myself that
and there you go you got

249
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:17,529
essentially inability to sit on top of
their rack in their data center

250
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:21,609
and participate in their network from
the inside they should not allow this to

251
00:15:21,609 --> 00:15:23,829
happen

252
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:27,809
that's a did graphic there is a little
louder on a stick it's about the size of

253
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:28,789
cases done

254
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:31,949
and it works

255
00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:34,989
so let's look at what you can actually
deal

256
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:39,279
if you had access to speak to the
routing protocol on someone's network

257
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,359
and I know is that this five times but
from the parking lot

258
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,139
you know with the laptop over wireless
you don't need physical access read-only

259
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:50,909
data center access nothing like that

260
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:55,829
so denial of service again the least
that possibility

261
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:00,109
you can just announce a competing route
okay we see that your web servers are on

262
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,249
this sudden that

263
00:16:01,249 --> 00:16:04,720
and announce the sudden that I'm gonna
try and make it preferred to the routing

264
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,319
table

265
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,019
and all the sudden all traffic that's
about on its way to your internal

266
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:08,609
network

267
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,699
will come to my laptop and not your
giant web farm

268
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,919
and suddenly you're Jan 15 isn't doing
much good your whole Tennessee it data

269
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,319
center just got finals

270
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:20,470
into her car so

271
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:24,659
and or if you're slightly more malicious
you can hijack it instead of just

272
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:25,850
sending the trafficked

273
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,459
into my car a you can actually do
something with it

274
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:33,169
responded as though you were the web
servers manipulate the data about it

275
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,259
somewhere else you something like that

276
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,079
or what I've seen as the worst
possibility and when my favorite stories

277
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,379
from life is an incident responder

278
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:45,589
you can pick in a new subnet in their
brains you can generally

279
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:49,679
tel de series ER and look up send is a
simple look at the routing cables

280
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,799
what they're using within their nap
locker what they're not you can pick

281
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:54,069
something that's not used

282
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:58,009
you can announce it the other routers
will pick this up and say hey to get it

283
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,149
10 10 10 such 24

284
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:03,279
go that way and then you have

285
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,329
a platform from which you can wreak
great habit

286
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:10,658
you can start spamming you can start
sending out all sorts now where

287
00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:14,809
and its from their network and they're
gonna be left holding the bag

288
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:18,259
something fairly similar to this
happened with say

289
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:22,829
bounding announcement hijacked with the
very large company which was actually in

290
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,638
that

291
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,959
78 you may have heard this a couple
years ago

292
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
but essentially the bad guys

293
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,668
hijacked the whole routing block
announced it got it accepted

294
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,029
preferentially in the global BGP tables

295
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:39,990
and spent about two weeks use spamming
in hacking and

296
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,029
doing all sorts of nasty things out in
this plot that was actually owned by

297
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:44,139
another company

298
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:47,629
and eventually they got discovered in
their eyes to cut them off but

299
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:51,509
now this company is on the blacklisted
like everyone on the planet

300
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,279
no one will talk to their mail servers
they've got all these angry people

301
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,730
knocking on their door saying use

302
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,250
TV stand you bastards and you know it's
their IP space

303
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,609
they're not gonna be able to do much
except trying clean it up

304
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,199
mostly unsuccessfully for an extended
period of time they actually end up

305
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,279
going back to Aaron's Inc we have
another class a pleasent

306
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,000
%uh no so

307
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,899
obviously if you are a network operator
you don't want this to happen to you

308
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:22,629
this is like your nightmare scenario
where you are visibly responsible for

309
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:25,119
all this that traffic that you didn't
want to allow

310
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,039
all because you let your admin said that
access point for convenience and it

311
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,379
started broadcasting stupid stuff

312
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:38,429
so here's an ethereal capture BIG IP
traffic again that we actually saw the

313
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:39,089
wild

314
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:43,220
and you can see it GOP as a his sister
protocol

315
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,990
announces the software version both I
less and to be a GRP

316
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,470
here's OSTs unauthenticated from the
wild

317
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,200
other highlighted lines says of type no

318
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,769
again super genius

319
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:02,980
and here's OSTs actually authenticated
it

320
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,220
this capture I can't decide what to do
about because

321
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,000
one of the things that I've been sorted
something my per diem about for years

322
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,289
is that I want people to authenticate
the routing sessions I want them to

323
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:17,349
trying to stop the sensor trust
relationship between their neighbors

324
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:20,089
and these people did that the
highlighted lines is of type

325
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:21,500
cryptographic so

326
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,619
you know big hug for actually doing the
right thing and of educating your OSTs

327
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:30,580
and a big smack upside the head for
sending it out over wireless

328
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,639
this was the only packet we saw yeah out
our whole capture

329
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:38,260
was we saw a lot of those yes this was
the only one that had authentication

330
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,658
turned on

331
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:42,669
so no love

332
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:46,220
up the other thing they is worth
considering

333
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,559
people to maintain large network usually
have some sort of monitoring service

334
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,049
that will tell them what Notre output
nodes are down

335
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:56,589
and the way that these services work is
also vulnerable to the sorts it packed

336
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:58,480
that we're seeing over this wireless

337
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,289
and you can inject things that will the
management service will pick up on

338
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,240
and will start sending interesting data
two years this point

339
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,309
and we're not even talking about like
you know sending fussing over flow data

340
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:14,950
to the management system although their
fellow that a lot of money runs to the

341
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,049
database backends a default passwords

342
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:22,179
but even if you don't have that stay are
a %uh those set up a CDP broadcast and

343
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm going to announce that I have

344
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,809
a new Cisco device on your network and
what will usually happen

345
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,178
is your network management system
although okay and uses a device on my

346
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:31,799
network

347
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,349
alright again S&M people you and I'm
gonna send you my strain your gonna

348
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:37,609
respond to that right

349
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:40,689
now you have their S&P community strings
and

350
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,500
even if it's not public a this is a
design flaw

351
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,789
the management software the way it's set
up you know it it's not specific to

352
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,510
wireless

353
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,359
but the additional tread exposure at
doing this over wireless

354
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,609
makes it significant enough that we
thought it was worth mentioning

355
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:02,639
now the biggest push back I've gotten on
my

356
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:07,000
back then security red is oh that'll
never happen no one ever does that you

357
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,429
know

358
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,359
we we need to deal with the real threats
out there without time to waste on this

359
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:15,879
so if we only have one point

360
00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:20,220
it is these are the real threats this is
something that needs to be addressed

361
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,250
there are exploit tools there's a glist
that you can use to do this

362
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:28,649
and in my time is a senior batsman
engineer I have actually seen

363
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:32,529
not over wireless but people using
similar things and

364
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:36,329
you know I haven't worked as and I stand
here in about five years so there was

365
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,289
happening five years ago you know it's
that today

366
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:43,809
and a lot people were depending up the
on bail after the attack tools for EI

367
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:44,849
GRP

368
00:21:44,849 --> 00:21:48,490
because it's a Cisco proprietary
protocol no one wanted to write things

369
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,359
for Cisco proprietary protocol that
might get them sued

370
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,500
and you know someone did it

371
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,740
there's a Russian company called our
hearts they wrote the hacking cisco

372
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,260
Network 6 Facebook

373
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,720
and David Prescott and have a little
yeah GRP tool suite

374
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,730
and you can still see a GOP package
against s the fields to be whatever you

375
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,470
want

376
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,990
and you can answer these networks
there's a

377
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,419
open source protocol suite called zebra
which will run demands were using it

378
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:19,070
here for us yes that it will also run
BGP

379
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,079
Rep other internal routing protocols and
so you don't need to

380
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,579
to have like a ten thousand dollar
router in the back to your car hauling

381
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,649
around this huge tickets which router

382
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,109
and burning it off your and inverter in
order to

383
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,939
attempted speak these out and try to
call you can download and compile a

384
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,240
software package

385
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,179
and sit in your car and do this stuff is
very practical and very possible

386
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:46,019
there's a layer 2 tool called you're
sending a and

387
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,519
it deals with HSRP and dCTP in a bunch
another layer to

388
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,210
like China king and the land type stuff
and it will allow you to manipulate

389
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,490
tools

390
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,629
there's a standard rate for search tool
called Cisco torso was also bitten by

391
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:00,829
the are hot guys the

392
00:23:00,829 --> 00:23:05,440
russian security sucks and in addition
to trying to be resource but to the

393
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,700
Cisco passwords and things like that it
will also try send known exploits adult

394
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,109
i likey ISL s web server exploit things
like that

395
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:18,000
and finally an FX Fantino leave has done
some really good work and has

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,539
a suite of tools then dared targeting
most major backbone protocols and you

397
00:23:23,539 --> 00:23:24,010
can get

398
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,470
a really excellent data when you doing a
background pen test from those things

399
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,839
so guys this is real and I know I'm
preaching to the choir here

400
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,309
but this is something you should never
see every a while it's because these

401
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:42,928
attacks are eminently possible

402
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,200
and we can see who did the slides and he
did not I

403
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,200
sows going to write up a bunch of slides
about how angry I was about the state a

404
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,760
routing protocols but

405
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,320
I decided instead there's going to grant
for a moment

406
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,460
so

407
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,849
let's see we have all these protocols
many of them have excuses well as

408
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,609
written

409
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,730
a long time ago and sauce

410
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:11,169
you know we see you get something that
would work in its reliable crypto Stu

411
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,909
Hart security is

412
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,990
optional so with the

413
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,839
that had that mindset I we we end up
with a lot of

414
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,519
%uh our production environments you know
the things that that allows to download

415
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,049
porn everyday

416
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:28,320
right are running on protocols that are
in the clear

417
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,820
so on this really kind of angers me

418
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,309
it angers me quite a bit so

419
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,599
you know a lot energy has been spend
lately

420
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:42,710
trying to break DRM systems trades it's
in the press all the time

421
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,010
you know perhaps most the people in this
room is spent some time reading a better

422
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:50,440
a cracking enter some one thing or
another um

423
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,809
so within the domain is that the RAM

424
00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,210
we know that it's pretty much fucked
right we know that the media is going to

425
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,210
get rendered

426
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,869
the keys are on the device now is
they're not gonna win

427
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:06,529
okay on in the cases %uh routing
protocols and

428
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:09,669
other type management tools we end up in
this case where

429
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:12,779
it is actually possible to lock it down
and cure it

430
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:16,769
its people are choosing not to there
designing new protocols

431
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:20,129
all the time where you read through the
specification

432
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:24,190
and you know the designers they're not
dumb people you know they say

433
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:28,179
you know there might be this hole here
where an attacker could

434
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:32,230
you know injected modify parameters but

435
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,519
I you know if you're worried about that
you can enable the security feature

436
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,000
than then there's little star you read
on below anna says

437
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,309
well thats inversion sue and you need to
have backwards compatibility version one

438
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:45,960
so

439
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,279
you know if doesn't work for back to
just unclear so

440
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,329
we end up with a lot of protocol designs
on many layers not just

441
00:25:53,329 --> 00:25:57,710
background stuff but you know even your
web services back and

442
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,039
Communications Corporation zone internal
enterprises where they just make a lot

443
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,500
of assumptions about

444
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,000
well there's a firewall there so it's
safe

445
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,210
you many times that is not the case I
actually had

446
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,889
one engagement where we had a client
seriously say that they put the fire

447
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:18,769
wall behind the access point to protect
it

448
00:26:18,769 --> 00:26:22,230
yeah

449
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,090
sorry go on

450
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,309
so with inner within the domain earth

451
00:26:26,309 --> 00:26:29,639
designing things for your back in
network making the

452
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,370
making the assumption that you know
you're in this safe little place where

453
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,059
no bad packets will enter

454
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:38,309
is usually a pretty bad assumption we
need to stop thinking about things in

455
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:40,529
that way when you start thinking about
the fact that

456
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:44,120
bad packets may enter your system at any
point

457
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:48,990
so if you would ask a a a an engineer
who's responsible for large backbone and

458
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:49,440
say

459
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,880
design your system so that an attacker
can plug into switches any points and

460
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,940
bad packets

461
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,990
that probably makes them different
design decisions about how that never

462
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,899
was architected

463
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:03,880
um you know obviously you know binding
mac Address is to ports and

464
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,370
using strong cryptographic verification
of all the routing protocols and other

465
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,389
such things but

466
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:14,190
a month you know today that's not what's
actually happening on the field

467
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,870
I mean these packets we're seeing here
we we found one packet

468
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,000
one packet with all the caps cheaper
through those actually doing proper

469
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,970
cryptographic verification those PS

470
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,580
why is that so some

471
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,559
the reason why I am I'm kinda francine
to all these folks at here right now is

472
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:30,918
that

473
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,220
we have a

474
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,440
a lot of energy spent on breaking

475
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,299
systems that you know allow us to get
free porn you know everyone wants free

476
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:41,830
porn

477
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,860
breaking the RAM that's very sexy and
hot right now

478
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,210
okay but there's a lot of other things
out there

479
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,710
that's a are still really suffering and
don't have enough is ability brought him

480
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,179
i mean

481
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:56,940
these many these routing protocols are
are very old but

482
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,240
new things are being Britain all the
time I mean when I look at some these

483
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,380
packet captures I'm seeing see new
protocols that

484
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,649
you know 30 may or may not know how to
parse

485
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:11,789
but frequently there are CDs or IEEE
documents about what

486
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:14,419
what they're used and how they work
reduce reading through the

487
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:15,529
specifications its

488
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:18,940
absolutely terrifying these things are
written you know six months ago

489
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:22,340
and they haven't thought about security
so um

490
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,779
I compels you to to go look at these
systems and spend some energy and think

491
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:28,880
about

492
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,510
what the impact might really be so let's
see

493
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:37,700
all that I want to say is you know as
hackers you guys need to pick things the

494
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,179
sock and break them

495
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:46,179
go for it

496
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,309
okay so sees

497
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:55,160
that's all the time I have for rent
moving along um looking at all the cash

498
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,230
as we have here

499
00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,330
um we have a huge number packets
obviously it's on wireless some us the

500
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,960
traffic we saw what a broadcast traffic
announcements

501
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,070
you know access point spewing a lot of
just beacons you know here I am

502
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,220
on me on me but you know some percentage
of that data

503
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:15,880
is obviously fascinating to us for this
talk so um

504
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,059
the relative percentages are quite small
as shown here so

505
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,210
um the reason why that may seem
insignificant oh well its only point O

506
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,230
four percent

507
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:29,480
is that as an attacker if I see that
point O four percent I see that packet

508
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,100
pop-up

509
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,160
that means I've got a really good target
you know it doesn't it doesn't take any

510
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,530
more than one packet

511
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,160
for for dedicated Thacker to you then
you know not just

512
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,169
friendly be driving around but you know
pull up in your parking lot on

513
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:45,640
with the case a mountain Dew in the back
in you know it's all over right

514
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,950
so and as far as threat modeling goes if
you see

515
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:52,090
with someone who's announcing their
routing protocol is something like that

516
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,910
odds are they don't exactly have the
best security in the world they're

517
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,500
probably a feature-rich target

518
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,419
okay so

519
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,299
um you know that looking just like
percentages love traffic this problems

520
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:05,910
not getting any better it's not like

521
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:11,440
all the the reason press about how bad
web is and how wifi is scary is actually

522
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,320
making this from any better if you look
at the

523
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,840
the percentages UHV management traffic
coming on the clear its

524
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,080
staying almost completely stable spent
the fact that there's

525
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,840
you know millions have no access points
today than there were in 2002

526
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,280
the percentages bad bad management
traffic

527
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,320
still the same so that means that the

528
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,658
people hadn't really thought about this
so

529
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:42,159
okay um worldwide averages according to
wiggle another online repositories that

530
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,450
track access points is that like
forty-two percent or something

531
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:50,350
to have the world it has some
rudimentary security turned on their

532
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,950
asses point um

533
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,289
in there's a relook at which is mostly
dense urban environments not necessarily

534
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:56,460
on the countryside

535
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,630
on which they found that the number to
be much higher you know we're talking

536
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,090
about places like Silicon Valley Seattle
New York Chicago center

537
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,850
um so you know that's a good thing
having

538
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,789
having the the web switch turned on
helps you a little bit

539
00:31:10,789 --> 00:31:13,970
right because that means it's an
attacker's driving around

540
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,559
it's a doesn't doesn't scream on me
quite as loudly but

541
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,090
obviously a lot of people are still
running web that what six minutes and

542
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,299
it's gone right so

543
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,120
um yes it's an animal is your parking
lot ever so briefly in order to find out

544
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,899
how that you are

545
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:34,139
okay so let's talk about

546
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:37,919
what what folks should actually be doing
to fix some other stuff right

547
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,330
some protocol design aside um

548
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:44,090
there are some things you can do to
configure these existing devices to make

549
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,850
them a lot

550
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:48,889
I'll lot more difficult to crack and
much less attractive right

551
00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:52,279
so um basically

552
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:55,899
don't broadcaster management traffic
under general use land set up a separate

553
00:31:55,899 --> 00:31:58,529
management plan for the stuff you know
it you don't want your

554
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:01,700
general use network you know where your
employees are sitting

555
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,899
you don't want to plug in an AP in
expose your

556
00:32:04,899 --> 00:32:08,389
back on if your organization you know
they should be management traffic should

557
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:12,039
be an immensely net should not shot
mingle with the public

558
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,658
yes and one of my other and things I get
a lot

559
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:20,059
is people say oh no you know there's
this trade-off between security and

560
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:23,490
availability security and redundancy
have to pick one

561
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,760
having good security means we have to
sacrifice our five nines we can't do

562
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,169
that

563
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:31,299
this is an obvious counterexample if
you're gonna have a management network

564
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,200
your people make out a downed managed
aroused and management networks

565
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,940
for a reason that has nothing to do with
security it's very helpful for security

566
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,000
but it so that if something goes
horribly wrong on your

567
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,850
3048 you can still get to that router
and fix it and

568
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,110
the places that I've works it had good
solid reliable networks

569
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:53,580
had out a bit and ways to get to the and

570
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,990
if it's a big networking you can afford
to invest in the infrastructure

571
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,059
if you run your management over it this
week yes separate network

572
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:04,428
you can keep it off the wireless you can
keep it separate from what

573
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:09,039
Joe average user is seeing and you will
help both availability and security

574
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,850
you don't have to pick

575
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:16,899
solar cycle and isolation I mean if I
was the chief security officer in all of

576
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:19,820
my employees looked like this crowd
right here at probably makes a

577
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:20,939
difference asians

578
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,250
but you know frequently you end up with

579
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,380
you know blue-collar white-collar

580
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,210
employees at large organizations all
over the place where the like I

581
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,240
you know it's its just our warehouse in

582
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,279
you now there ten dollars an hour
packing boxes there they don't pose a

583
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,100
threat to us so we're just

584
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,190
gonna make the network of flattened
it'll be fine

585
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,809
don't worry about it so I think that
maybe an hour

586
00:33:49,809 --> 00:33:53,639
um other things you can do

587
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:57,080
%ah on your router setting your
interface is the passes obviously they

588
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,460
don't

589
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,029
spew is much less sensitive information
out there reduces your

590
00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:05,129
your factors quite a bit because you
can't configure interface just be

591
00:34:05,129 --> 00:34:07,139
passive means they can still it's a
drought but

592
00:34:07,139 --> 00:34:11,069
I will not be being noisy

593
00:34:11,069 --> 00:34:14,819
noisy piece on your network um turn of
CP

594
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:19,668
it's great for debugging is really handy
shut it off okay

595
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:22,940
um the trip to management traffic um

596
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,730
whenever you deal with a lot of these
management tools

597
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,940
they are frequently run over HTTP or god
forbid telnet

598
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,659
no many these tools even ones that are
recently bill

599
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,940
don't use even basic encryption for a

600
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,659
the routing protocols themselves as well
as like the management of those devices

601
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:44,780
are you talking about

602
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,609
you can log into you you know a device
that can cycle power on all your servers

603
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,418
over clear text HTTP

604
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:54,658
over the Internet does that seem like a
good idea I mean

605
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,619
Luton don't do that this I feel like I'm
preaching to the choir

606
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:01,690
is most the folks sitting in this room
know that these things are bad but

607
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,920
this had the stuff is very much out
there

608
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,710
I anyone who hears them were driving
before

609
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:15,160
alright so I guess is a nasty stuff in
your PDF files

610
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,520
okay

611
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,770
so and for those are you that our
network operators

612
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,750
one thing that I think would really help
is to push back for the vendors and

613
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,680
demand

614
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,720
good authentication demands good
encryption demand the security features

615
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,530
because

616
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:35,950
a lot of what I hear the vendors is %uh
no one wants that everyone likes SNMP v1

617
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,379
that's totally fine

618
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,190
it works from my father is gonna work
for you yeah so

619
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,650
if you can actually say no we want the
encryption we demand this feature this

620
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:48,460
is a priority for us when we're
evaluating your equipment in

621
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,740
picking what to buy they will start to
change their behavior they

622
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,390
they follow the money they will respond
to customer demand so

623
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,170
finally a you know 30 you guys are in
charge networks out there

624
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,470
you nobody yourself it's not hard to do
in the tools are readily available

625
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:10,310
you know we had a slide with them of the
tools are there for auditing yourself

626
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,430
not as ready for a loss but Wireless in
a fire kismet

627
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:16,529
look for open a piece if you see any you
know fix that

628
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,980
um when it comes to to 0

629
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,180
well we're in the middle of nowhere so
that's not really a threat I mean

630
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,660
that's that's not true at all as untrue
plus the folks here now

631
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,980
um it's a politics couple packets to
make yourself look like an really

632
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,550
attractive target to an attacker

633
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,850
finally um a plea for packets

634
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:43,360
so what we said all are you were driving
tell those hands that went up in the

635
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:43,870
back

636
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:47,529
you know the dodgy folks in the back
there we want to see our packets

637
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:51,480
%uh so we've collected quite a few from
lots of different folks some

638
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,040
as you can tell by the presentation we
try to masquerade that the details of

639
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,980
all if you're a

640
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,620
nasdaq-listed organizations in Silicon
Valley

641
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,720
but Tom we would love to see more

642
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,520
because we'd like to get a better idea
what what other types of on a bill is

643
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,190
out there just sent out a clear

644
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,160
um so then Eve you have additional
packages and as you can

645
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,870
email us here and and get it over to us
with amend sleepy she added

646
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,279
um and the thank you very much you gonna

647
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:25,280
great audience

648
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,729
so at this point so what if any new you
have any questions

649
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:35,930
is fire way might my questions regarding

650
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,259
sought sarbanes-oxley compliance um

651
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:42,880
as you probably know there are posit
that and say the network should be

652
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,749
convinced that should be secured in the

653
00:37:44,749 --> 00:37:48,109
social security numbers and confidential
information should not be

654
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:51,219
made in the clear have you are you

655
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:55,239
have you are you working with the
regulatory bodies to let them know

656
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,219
all the companies which may be
infringing night on compliance

657
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:03,720
so

658
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,010
yeah I have attempted to notify a few
different organizations when i've seen

659
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:12,119
highly suspicious packets a.m. emanating
from the network I've not worked with

660
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,480
any regulatory bodies

661
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,930
at this point some frankly there's so
much about their

662
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,180
I it's kinda hard to be the good cop

663
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,730
you know it and serve report to you it's
just love those organizations but

664
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,109
um ultimately I don't feel that it's a
silly my responsibility to help

665
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:32,089
all these companies lock down their
networks I think reporting them to

666
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:37,029
spines oxime then you know that maybe
something that I consider if it was an

667
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:38,180
extreme case but

668
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:45,180
I've never done in the past thanks

669
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:51,519
any other questions out there %ah

670
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,720
is there a you know

671
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,220
you know a network management software
is their network management software

672
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,460
that you think sorta sets a standard

673
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,160
the you like to see it's currently
available

674
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:06,339
and it really depends on the

675
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,550
purpose and that's what is network that
you're monitoring and what you actually

676
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,540
want to use

677
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:17,060
and I found it I have to admit to a
weakness for Nagios for the awesome 3d

678
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:19,220
visualizations that's just badass

679
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:23,790
up but you can get I also like now yes
are being pretty highly configurable

680
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:27,800
so it's not so much take a better
software suite as configure software

681
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,970
suite intelligently

682
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,180
do good threat modeling figure out where
your gonna

683
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:35,490
you use it and if you're likely to have
new

684
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:40,270
devices pop up there not for example if
I monitoring a network that is my

685
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:44,450
your backbone routers nothing should pop
up there without me knowing about it I

686
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,960
don't wanna have to know constant
polling going on at devices that are not

687
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,620
on the approved list that you can change

688
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:54,470
if I am monitoring in networker you know
move I'll access devices where they may

689
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,670
drop and then pop off the network then
you may need something like that and but

690
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,270
it might make sense to say all right

691
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,370
this claim us authenticate itself with
credentials to the server first and then

692
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:11,370
we connect back or something like that

693
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,480
go ahead alright um Japanese

694
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,630
Pacific break it

695
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:23,840
ideas for or recommendations regarding
small or

696
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,550
networks such as those on schools or
even home networks

697
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:32,060
well if you're on a home network you're
probably not announcing

698
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:35,700
lotteries back then protocols and the
things that you would need to worry

699
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,230
about

700
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,560
are clear text data in general and

701
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,990
devices that are monitoring your own
stuff so if you're running SNP internal

702
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,000
down your home network

703
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,290
no use the three or something you
something that's actually he got

704
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:53,060
encryption and it would really depend on
what's on the home network

705
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:58,009
you know a lotta stuff is difficult for
the budget restricted

706
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,530
but you the good thing is that it here

707
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,890
if you've got a sly networking you're on
a tight budget you probably also don't

708
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,040
have the circlip and it's causing you
know

709
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,890
these syslog says fire all day then such
there was any

710
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:14,819
just in general try not to send stuff in
the clear and have authentication

711
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,030
whenever you do sense to

712
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,100
I get it there's a lot of open source
software available

713
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:24,370
it pays to be paranoid all you do is
download figure out how to use it in

714
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,060
general though

715
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,180
um if you just using web you're in
trouble if using

716
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,270
WPA with a pre-shared key you're in
trouble so

717
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:34,450
I using wpa2 is is

718
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,510
decent option not great but usually for
most home users say

719
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,860
using yeah enterprise the TPS
indications

720
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,960
little bit difficult setup but you can
do it with the

721
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,420
you know using freeradius what not you
can save a strong

722
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:55,570
signed an occasional good key rotation
on our

723
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:58,770
any other question other good yeah i was
just wondering what is your involvement

724
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,130
in IETF

725
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:03,380
are you guys doing it is for the
protocol development with it. after you

726
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,020
ready

727
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,130
that's common practices documentation
deep landing in San Diego November

728
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,890
we were just talking about this last
night

729
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,490
and yeah I am beginning to work with

730
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,750
summer the IETF people on a lot of the
new protocol development its order

731
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,880
new personal project design as he
asserted

732
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,920
failing at system from the outside his
not then terribly successful event

733
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,660
that's about the same stuff for like

734
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,750
five years and as we just saw with the
other

735
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:35,840
catches in 2002 has gotten much better
I'm

736
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,370
about to tackle fortunes in the inside
and the outside we'll see how that goes

737
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,819
second question how much of your
presentation do you think applies to you

738
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,550
wired

739
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,490
point to point likes well the principles
there is still sound but the

740
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:50,850
accessibility is less

741
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,620
so you ideally I would like to see
people applying these principles and

742
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,270
design

743
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:59,910
and accepting an authenticating
regardless but

744
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,480
it's not quite as easy for someone to
attack and

745
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,750
when I raisin ice the engineer I did see
people you're trying to set up neighbors

746
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:09,760
sessions very

747
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,020
devices they were like who's that and
things like that and in at least one

748
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,140
case we're

749
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:18,420
virtually certain that it was a
malicious attempt rather than just

750
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,770
someone play and the wrong port it like
the many

751
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,830
so it still does happen

752
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:28,529
albeit less frequently but when it does
happen it set up higher stakes more

753
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,440
deliberate

754
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,310
that her attacker thank you huh time

755
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,259
home

756
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:40,600
I recently inherited um a couple is
Cisco switches on a fairly busy network

757
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,870
and I don't have that much experience
working with them

758
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,920
and i notice like after week powered
everything up then

759
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,450
like everything in it was there was
running I noticed that

760
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,770
it required a firmware update to enable
SSH and

761
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:58,130
SSL further management stuff and to the
from work to close

762
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:01,150
rebooting the switch obviously it's not
really an option if it sorry I

763
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,950
is there a cut-off point for these
thoughts when they actually have

764
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:10,480
crypto on the firmware I could go on
Cisco devices is actually then they

765
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,510
and difficult issue they

766
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,870
up they've got a lot better he I will
give them that and

767
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:20,540
they used to not do it because they
didn't have customer demand for it or

768
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:24,029
they would enable it their experimental
releases as I less

769
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:28,170
but say oh well you can have crypto or
you have good MPLS

770
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,080
or something like that and so year for
people who needed the other features

771
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,380
it wasn't really an option but in recent
years they've had bigger demands the

772
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:39,130
difficulty is the support contracts you
know a lot of times

773
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,320
the require a Cisco dot com login and

774
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,580
support contact down to it before the
lets you download the things with the

775
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,920
updated firmware and that I think I can
see why they're doing it financially but

776
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,450
security wise it is a problem they're
not really helping people who

777
00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:58,750
you know inherited all devices by them
of me because they can't afford paces

778
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,700
got busily in dollars for one at cetera

779
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:05,020
and actually at as Black Adam gonna be

780
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:08,030
on a panel discussing Boehner abilities
closure with the

781
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:13,540
as CIO Cisco and this is one of the
things that I intend to bring up thanks

782
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,650
thank you for presentation

783
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:22,460
talking about these clear texts
management protocols routing protocols

784
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,240
you over wireless heavy seen examples
where the wiles network has web for WPA

785
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,960
or whatever and you're still having

786
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,940
those third text editor for the public
now well

787
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,650
said sweet just solicited the fact that
captures we didn't actually go through

788
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,510
and try and break anyones encryption as
they had on their

789
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:44,130
we look at statistics for okay there's X
networks with the caption rx without

790
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:44,750
that

791
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,260
essentially the way to be collected this
day there was very similar to what we

792
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:51,110
just did on the last slide except we
rode our friends in said

793
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:55,000
hey you know please ask your locals to
send us captors were collecting data for

794
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,310
this purpose for this talk

795
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,500
so because it wasn't yellow a

796
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,420
okay let's go out and ourselves in
parking lots targeting shit

797
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,000
you we didn't really trying crack into
anyone's Network Cell

798
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,300
since a lot of protocols are broadcast
so if they were running Weber WPA

799
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,760
encryption would you be able to

800
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,510
from the outside broadcast this message
that they can have it be

801
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:21,210
protest and the piece that has a wired
network with some your tax still hold up

802
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,500
even if they want right now while some
their tax well

803
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:29,690
if you break the impression then you can
send with that encryption and

804
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:32,830
your call as so the castle work it

805
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:36,230
on the layer that they're intended to
work regardless says

806
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:42,170
you know what you doing on the base
layer that thats I wanted to ask you

807
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,470
guys more about that database or their

808
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,740
archive they are building up packets
that people are sending you

809
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,650
can you give me a sense a how much data
you have and how much you'd like to have

810
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,940
before you release another sort of
statistical analysis

811
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:01,240
well as far as the data that we have
that we told the people that were

812
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,590
sending it to us that it would all be
held in confidentiality were gonna

813
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:07,830
release any data about it other than
your very they

814
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:11,730
sprints the anonymous tips so yell we
can't really

815
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,570
so much about that as far as how much we
have to have before we do something else

816
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:17,160
it's kinda fuzzy I think

817
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,620
you know oh well yo okay we've seen
plenty bad stuff now we we feel like we

818
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,920
have something to say I think it's

819
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,390
internal senses alright this is worth

820
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,430
yelling at people about can you can you
at least give us a sense of how many

821
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,029
people have sent you

822
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:36,760
data or how much just how much you have
in terms of volume

823
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,980
and Canada the people that I personally
asked for data

824
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,860
I think I solicited for about 100 people

825
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,010
okay and plus what these guys did and

826
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:55,010
thank you that's the strangest thinks it
I wanted to know

827
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,920
well IP protocol you would use if you
send it up

828
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,370
and also %uh the remediation process

829
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:05,880
and the process flow if you say never
something

830
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,950
our wifi up how would you cobo

831
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:12,010
a seven up secure and well

832
00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,060
after your devices up if you do you like
the

833
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,940
basic Wireless audit just getting a
packet capture what you've got

834
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,570
and watching your own network will give
you a good idea you can

835
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:26,690
you like Erica say even though this is a
90 percent each other the actual date

836
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:27,390
out there

837
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,900
like you can put up with it the real and
type in OSPF the bar

838
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:35,560
and it will filter and CEO Neos kept
ethical pet will pop up

839
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,560
so if you know what's that and you know
what you're looking for you can filter

840
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,020
your

841
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,950
that he catches for those specifically
to see if anything like that is being

842
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:42,870
transmitted

843
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,850
you can port scan your devices on your
network and you see what your

844
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,890
advertising out to him

845
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:51,879
if a if you'd like to send some emails
that email address we can send you the

846
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,700
a theory of filter using the to extract
a lot of the more interesting packets

847
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,550
at a bar captures so to special is the
amount will bounce back with assault or

848
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:00,460
if you like it

849
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,310
I wanted action if you send it up
wounded you use

850
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:08,490
what I P protocol which you use if you
had a common

851
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:11,720
a jackhammer have routing protocols or
exactly

852
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:17,040
run programs and OSPF is a pretty decent
routing protocol I would turn on the

853
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,390
trip to authentication

854
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:21,710
and set the interfaces that are facing
in torture land passage

855
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,110
so that they're not advertise no SPF
Outdoor Channel and it only really needs

856
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:25,710
to be done

857
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:29,040
towards the inside

858
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,360
I don't like the idea of you much but
you have to paces go basically to run

859
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,120
that

860
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:39,790
as a routing protocol as you for all the
OSPF for you for free

861
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,900
so any other questions out there

862
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,350
I don't think we're gonna call it a
close then thank you for your time
