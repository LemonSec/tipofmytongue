1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,409
you're about to hear about are fit and
privacy

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:07,950
before that a few programming
announcements later today

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,129
1700 we had scheduled exploring just
because the web unfortunately that talk

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,720
happen we've replaced it with a sci-fi
talk

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,349
have more information on that in a
little bit stay tuned

6
00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:22,949
we've also had to change him become
clogged later today

7
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,710
track a with off the hook will be still
happening there just reversed so

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,859
kevin Mitnick tomorrow off the hook
indecent today

9
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,930
then up further ado

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,710
should introduce never 76 is a PhD
candidate

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,480
computer science he's about to talk to
you about all sorts of things you

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,590
probably didn't think goes

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,769
with orchid and privacy Arsenal

14
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:53,769
thanks for the introduction

15
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,879
welcome 2006 and welcome to my talk on

16
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:01,329
are for the proxy I'm impressed by the
time

17
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,890
thank you for coming I'm costing

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,900
PHD's to net University of Virginia and
my

19
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,220
research is in the area of topography

20
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,240
dealing mainly with RFID privacy and
security at the moment

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,750
I wanna FT's as intact if as possible so

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,350
interrupted anytime with questions saw
if you need clarification

23
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:29,260
okay and are briefly go over the basic
so far for the ICM that

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,390
all the few know what what freddy is
about

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:38,980
so are fitted tax I'll on me because
that was pacify her for the text are

26
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,210
very small silicon chips

27
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,320
attached antenna and is upper right
picture

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,390
this so the silicon chip is really only
to

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,490
come the tiny like dot

30
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,140
on their lower limit on that

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,340
used to be about square millimeter than

32
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,400
that went down to have a square
millimeter nobody really thought we

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:03,820
could

34
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,890
too small I talk to somebody of Phillips

35
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,199
last week day it down to quote the
square millimeter and

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,330
and shrinking so is a tiny tiny which
makes them very

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,730
sheep if you have a waiver silicon you
can tens of thousands hundreds of

38
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,280
thousands

39
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,830
system one waiver for that one price
we're talking

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,690
five cents at the moment a square
millimeter of silicon costs about four

41
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,350
cents

42
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,640
fit onto a quarter the silicon itself
cost you

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,100
a sensory itself 5 but that's the crazy

44
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,610
to another reason why these

45
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,569
tax extremely cheap as they don't have a
battery of any salsa

46
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:46,670
of power on them so that they must be
powered

47
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,780
by the reading device passively pouts
reduction

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,380
now which makes them not operates if
there is no reason

49
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,799
run are ready takes a everywhere

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,140
who have you use is that this PPS Exxon
Mobil

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,480
who have you has an American Express
credit card so

52
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,019
maybe you already have an hour for the
take maybe maybe you will get it within

53
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,850
ex-cop

54
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:15,609
but All American Express credit card
have it at the moment so

55
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,550
it's getting you pick it is who has a
car later then

56
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,900
2002 all

57
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,340
hockey stick that have protection have
for the texan

58
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,430
so it's it's really everywhere already
and on we'd be read many headlines on

59
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,180
our for the Walmart requires

60
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,810
all this applies to put our for the text
on the pallets

61
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,010
and the packages not on the item's
itself so far that's too expensive

62
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,239
same for the DOD it Department of
Defense

63
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,690
day on concerned with logistics

64
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,120
let's say rough environments Iraq
Afghanistan and a

65
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,170
they won this means that out too through
through more information

66
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm deal at major plane ARF Eddie

67
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,400
all that hard to believe they haven't
received all have met but

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
day they not so much concerned with
logistics but with

69
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,610
theft protection if you can track
everything either

70
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,680
you know when you lost on right and
razor blades that their

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,680
the most commonly still good

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,680
in the world there are fifty market this

73
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,139
yes is worth close to three billion
already and we're just starting

74
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:31,199
it grew 39 percent from last year and

75
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,110
is an estimate by some consultant see
agency we

76
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,689
will hit that double-digit billions soon

77
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:42,889
I'm might focus can

78
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,979
be concerned with our for the privacy
and I already talked to limit on

79
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,229
on are for the back on I'll give you
some more basics as we go along to you

80
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:55,219
to help you understand I will next talk

81
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:58,620
about to threats that that iraq

82
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,639
arise from on are fed the use

83
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,870
and well then look into solutions on

84
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,270
the product a level this is not an
academic talk but I'll

85
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,698
try to relate it as much as possible 22
recent

86
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,330
research I'm mainly

87
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,938
and area of protocols well then look
into as the latest

88
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:22,639
I'm that the physical and the system
level where

89
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,749
more privacy on

90
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:29,939
issues arise I'm what is the

91
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:34,460
most commonly thought straighter in our
bodies that's that you carry text that

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,919
disclose information about you and if
you've seen any token

93
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:42,859
are for the product ever you probably
know mister Jones

94
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,339
IRA's through our state security

95
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:50,389
mister Jones slits in the future where
are for the has been deployed

96
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,379
large-scale

97
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,439
and he carries several are for the text

98
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,259
these are already takes Mikes disclose
information that that

99
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,550
he would consider private-sector on

100
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,849
they everybody who has a scanning device
can can learn

101
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:10,990
these things about him and a scanning
device Nokia for example already puts

102
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,180
puts reading devices in cell phones so
very soon

103
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,879
everybody will carry an hour for the
reader so

104
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,099
on you could learn that he was the
weekend has a replacement hip

105
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,400
on you could learn about his political
interests by happen

106
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,289
which books it checked out from the
library I'm

107
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,438
a proposal by the European federal bank
with T

108
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:37,960
on to make Bank Note smartphone fit
resistance through putting out for the

109
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,900
takes and them

110
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,319
safety if you could digitally sign
something put it on the banknote

111
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,069
that's much harder to counterfeit then
the bank note itself

112
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:50,270
and as are israel's points out this
allows for

113
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,549
extremely efficient marking you

114
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:57,490
he'd you don't have to guess anymore who
has most money is

115
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:01,710
probit so all all this information you
might want to keep private

116
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,119
and on what's

117
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:09,199
what what's the problem with was our up
for the text so far

118
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,039
if you read the number you know what
product it is and that's called the

119
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,430
the electronic product code so usually
are for the text have

120
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,300
96 bit ID thats all they can to take and
submit that

121
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,129
I D that's it super small tip I'm

122
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:29,529
that the information itself is then
stored in some computer network

123
00:07:29,529 --> 00:07:32,770
and that the product code is broken into
and this is

124
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,520
kinda similar to the mac address these
and that to into a manufacturer id:

125
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,270
that that is assigned to different
manufactures by the PC global

126
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,539
organization I'm and then the main
effect its health can assign product

127
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,248
ID's

128
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:50,550
that there must a the same for group of
products they like the shirt that size

129
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,619
that color

130
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:56,089
now and then unique item id: so the
first to be manufactured in productivity

131
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,050
you would find in Baku

132
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,909
but that that last year on them but
that's the unique number so this is

133
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:05,969
this is what allows for for very
efficient logistics

134
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,210
I'm and having having in like your

135
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,189
rope reader who can you can get to
manufacture the product

136
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:16,360
at the allows 22 to look that up to

137
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,669
to know that is the bank note of that
that fell you this is the week

138
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:23,990
so on on this solution to this is easy

139
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,550
and straightforward just don't use
structured identifies

140
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,719
uses random numbers is those two point
into database and

141
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,990
and look up information so that that UPC

142
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,120
code is

143
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,880
is the reason why are for the text
disclose information

144
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,170
now and there's discussion which which

145
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,040
scenario we would you that I'm so the
problems

146
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,509
kinda soul only industry has to you
understand that

147
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:56,870
there's a second threat of far for the
privacy

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,050
people taking so this scenario being
that innocent Alice

149
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,529
roams and some environment and

150
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:09,949
she doesn't disclose any information
directly we have random

151
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:13,229
identify so her her for the takes

152
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,769
give numbers out that unless you only
pay

153
00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:20,019
the you don't get information but

154
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,350
the numbers they sustain so different
reading events can be late and you can

155
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,550
you can build the trace of of Ellis
right so

156
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:34,170
that thats of less privacy concern for
most people

157
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,990
more its its up to it too to see how
this this from

158
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,490
penetrates anonymity but combining this
with other information that is collected

159
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,029
already I'll allows for very good
profiling

160
00:09:46,029 --> 00:09:49,160
and data mining so this information
should be kept

161
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,430
private I'm what and that you

162
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,980
solutions to to that problem just as
many things implemented and proposed so

163
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,750
far

164
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,019
and the PC organization itself has

165
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,129
as to opportunity to kill tax

166
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:08,740
at checkout time so that the don't give
functional

167
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,100
are for the text to customers 1c what
you sell the take all the good that it's

168
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,879
attached to

169
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,389
you kill it I'm that request to pass
what that has to come from the many

170
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,370
factors for the wholesale to do

171
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,540
retail so that this some issues thereof
key management

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,689
other proposals where to just Rep

173
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:31,389
are for the texan and metal foil I so

174
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:35,050
physics class tells us Faraday cages

175
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:38,110
don't allow radio communication I

176
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,829
I'm or you could actively to stop the
protocol in other proposed by Aaron to

177
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,209
mister the block attack where you carry
another tech

178
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:51,860
that this thats deter to read a its

179
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,029
confuse the reader basically once that
the reader tries to procure ask for

180
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,600
for identifies it it generates

181
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,430
suit attacks and that the readers not
gonna find out anything about you

182
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,350
I'm and then to last up to obviously
it's its array technology so if you just

183
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,810
jam to rate the frequency

184
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,199
its not going away anymore which might
be illegal in most leagues

185
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:17,870
stations all these from

186
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,519
proposals from

187
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,699
effectively prohibit the use of
profanity

188
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:29,509
so on there's a trade-off between

189
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:32,889
comfort and privacy here and as we know
from

190
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:36,540
how many of you discredit cuts resident
cash

191
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,649
yeah well you decided for comfort right
and

192
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,920
I guess the same would happen without
for the so

193
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,459
people don't want to the text to be cool
people don't wanna wrap them in

194
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:51,829
aluminium foil or karen has a teapot

195
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:55,269
so let's look into

196
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:58,379
what solution three such cases

197
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,129
and here we come to trip up a few
feeling working at

198
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:06,290
am this scenario now is that we that we
want

199
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,819
detect to respond in a way that you
can't link

200
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,889
different reading events so each time he
credited take

201
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:15,980
it responds with a different number
that's the goal

202
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,279
I and now ellis's

203
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,560
the reader order that legitimate
database that owns

204
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,699
the tax and Alice

205
00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:29,019
chassis one key with each text search
she has a list of

206
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,389
of keys meaning secrets fine restraints

207
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:37,000
and every tech has one key

208
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,019
down the techno on being probed

209
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,189
thinking of to to reveal its ID I'm

210
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:46,819
generates number use once a nonce a
random string

211
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:50,089
up its again yeah each time a different
strain

212
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,860
on and Jesus hash function the key hash
function that is a function

213
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,060
that you can easily compute in one way
so

214
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,730
given input you can easily compute
output but not the way around given the

215
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,410
output

216
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,310
its almost impossible to get input its
attractive functional one my function

217
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,379
she she generates using her secret P

218
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:13,829
and that that random number the hash out

219
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:18,550
and sensed a random number and hash
output over to Alice

220
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,930
who now the Casey outta protocol would
work how does

221
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,220
Ellis now see what

222
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,920
tech generated this response what she
does is she

223
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,829
she uses the hash function was every
possible key on that random number

224
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,279
and sees was a dark match is right so
the first key doesn't the second does so

225
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,800
Ellis knows which which text is talking
to

226
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
somebody who doesn't have two keys does
not no one is saying it's too random

227
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,050
booking numbers

228
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,740
one is really random in the hash output
is pseudorandom

229
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,430
I'm there's two problems with that one
being the

230
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:57,160
unsolved big problem of computer
security key management

231
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,279
how to get the keys on the reader howdy

232
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:03,579
howdy share control if they've different

233
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:06,610
authorities need to retake all these
things but

234
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,889
that left aside as the CEP second
problem

235
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:13,589
I'm in this case Ellis had to do to have
operations

236
00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:16,839
but what if there is more tax

237
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,600
like really more case and we're talking
billions of tax

238
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,709
Ellis would have to do billions of have
has operations in order to

239
00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:29,759
to to find the right XO that doesn't
scale is a problem now

240
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,920
scale ability to to real-world and

241
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,100
academia and research it it looks nice
lot small-scale

242
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,910
but then we talk the point is to Walmart
every item

243
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:44,569
being tech that's billions Sep that's
the good work I'm

244
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:47,850
there that the next step to to make

245
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,569
dis same product como scaleable is to
SoCal

246
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:54,970
30 secrets so the idea now being

247
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,089
we're under protocol several time and

248
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:01,329
each time remove down one level of dick

249
00:15:01,329 --> 00:15:06,060
of two trees so with a trio of nine
texier

250
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,110
from and the protocol runs twice

251
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,060
so on on the first run we have again run
this public over three keys

252
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,480
we we find out that the public he has
been used

253
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,249
yeah and we run the protocol again find
out satyr

254
00:15:21,249 --> 00:15:25,370
the and now we know that to take we are
probing must

255
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,959
be in the left so I 50 after tree we
don't know which take it is here

256
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,399
we we can run the protocol again and
from

257
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,529
week find it to take that we're looking
for

258
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,139
either this take obviously has to stop
boesky's that has two

259
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:46,139
to be able to generate both responses
for both around some the protocol

260
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:49,800
I'm that the scalability is extremely
true

261
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,769
week we don't have real cool in a number
of special operations anymore meaning if

262
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:54,079
we

263
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,110
billions of tax bill in South Africa
operations

264
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:04,110
with a look at Red number depending on
the tree structure

265
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:09,040
good question I'm using

266
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,199
a hash function as we know it like some
md5 facade 01

267
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:18,129
I'm that's not gonna work that at least
doubles the price

268
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:21,439
plus much more concerning quarters the
reading

269
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:26,329
distance because on you have to pass if
we powered it XO

270
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,790
I'm there the the more you compute the
more power you have to get it taken

271
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,249
since it's coming through induction you
have to get closer than

272
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:38,620
however we might not really needs hash
functions and

273
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,870
computer science sense what we do need
is one way

274
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,689
functions yeah and there's some
proposals how to construct

275
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:50,420
very cheap one-way functions and so

276
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,790
we do yes we do have a communication
overhead but

277
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,949
it might it might still be feasible yeah

278
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:01,050
a question thanks any more questions on
their

279
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,740
everybody was me okay an

280
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,910
so did

281
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,290
this product allows us to to scale to
large system

282
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,079
on there is one issue with this protocol
can receive issue

283
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,290
yeah on

284
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,460
we share secrets among several texts so
all

285
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,589
all the left X have to poke you I

286
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:27,690
that means if you can get the keys

287
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,010
on from the tax and that's not too
difficult for you

288
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:38,010
you can its silicon

289
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:47,469
I'm what would you do is you that that
the branching factor

290
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,400
is not 3 its you you can

291
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,870
with a was it real what's like 325

292
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,580
three levels you can scale to billions
of tax so you won't ever get over five

293
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,990
but still then even five is is extra
cost

294
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:07,050
is five times more memory for the keys
is five times more communication back

295
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,960
and forth

296
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,090
yes so yes there is costs associated
with it

297
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:18,919
it it's feasible

298
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,400
yet the question is is reading gonna
take longer

299
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,400
well yes it if

300
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,970
if you have three levels up the tree
it's going to take three times as long

301
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,690
yeah I'm said the issue with this

302
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,390
tree other than that Associated extra
cost is

303
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,810
you share secrets among several pics and
so you can extract the keys from some of

304
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,629
the text

305
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,690
and you can if you if you had already

306
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,710
broken attack on the left side and you
could if you see the

307
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,660
and protocol going on you could say
whether to take

308
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,810
is using the public key or not because
you know the purple you know so you know

309
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,159
was that the the keys in the left how so

310
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,470
on of I so so we did some master and

311
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:08,630
and from looked into

312
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,950
how many keys how many takes you would
need to break

313
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,830
in order to to to get a sufficient
information about

314
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:20,470
the tax and so how we define information
leakage

315
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:25,180
as given in this graph is if weekend the
fight that the group of tax

316
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:28,200
into two subgroups and put every play

317
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,750
if place every taken one of the group
that's one bit yeah

318
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,230
if you fall group that stupid three so
if you could say

319
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,190
male-female that's one bit okay you
could say

320
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,530
male and female and above or below

321
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,550
median salary that's two bits

322
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,780
I'm turns out that this is highly
simplified but

323
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,450
if if you break 20 takes on a certain
assumptions the contract

324
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,340
half of texan have to take San

325
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,470
reasonable I'm attack a scenario

326
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:05,170
so thats very feasible for somebody who
wants launcher

327
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,410
on large-scale attack

328
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:15,410
I'm so we're seeing

329
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,010
and what you can do is you can break to

330
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,650
the tree of Secrets into small group
yeah

331
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,300
not not necessarily group of one tech
but small group

332
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,780
and then if you have only one take in
this group in your environment

333
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,830
you can uniquely identified so it's not
really

334
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,919
seeing that take but distinguishing that
take

335
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,050
from every as a take that one think okay

336
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:51,580
which allows for linking to reading
events so we've seen that

337
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,419
on the product however wherever from
scale ability

338
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,790
a privacy trade-off that's that's not
really

339
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,678
sought through yet what the the best
trees had a

340
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,290
would be if there's another option then
the tree it doesn't look like it

341
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:11,210
that has been reset going on for several
years now and she's the best that we

342
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,809
have

343
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,129
but might be ho I'm

344
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,460
but still even if we had to protocol
that works not allow

345
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:23,240
for tracking at all we would still be
concerned with

346
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,429
other levels of an hour for the system
privacy can leave at different levels

347
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,040
and

348
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,600
what an hour for the 0 we first talk
about the physical ever

349
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,160
primacy so from the problem here is that

350
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,500
if you have two different exit don't
want them to be distinguishable because

351
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:47,510
if there were a you could Lincoln right
on a physical level that's difficult tax

352
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,550
can look very different this is some
text by

353
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,860
Elgin technologies to have extremely
beautiful looking

354
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,270
antenna but all of these texts must

355
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,920
not be distinguishable I'd

356
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,530
I don't see any way in which that would
be possible you just we did some

357
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,580
experiments you

358
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,409
from you send some high frequency on

359
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,450
radio waves basically to detect and he
measured a reflection and absorption and

360
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,640
beloved is textbook

361
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,380
very different and then ultimate
difference this is

362
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,420
a schematic of which and there for the
Welsh

363
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,170
its antenna is sequoias around to ferret
caugh said

364
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:31,100
think sick attack that is what is in
your car keys

365
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,990
it's more reliable and there's no way
which you can make this

366
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,340
indistinguishable from like a printed
tech

367
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,418
right so big issues was over the privacy
here

368
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,570
nobody really has a solution to that yet
I'm

369
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,590
another level at which we can attack

370
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,899
privacy is the system level and dinner
for the system

371
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,390
looks as this slideshow see

372
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,270
you've already seen the tax on the left
and and the reading devices but

373
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,700
to reading devices it's helpful only I'm

374
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,300
connecting into big a network said that

375
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,450
that the probe suffered began that way
on the reading device gets the number it

376
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,410
has to you to make these if it's so it's

377
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,910
it has two to find database it has to
look up a database

378
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,510
on and and then

379
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,669
get that information on that take from
the database so

380
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:28,820
the object namespace it it's not only
person my name to the

381
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,700
DNS domain name space service its it's
basically the same focus it

382
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,140
awareness is built on top of two DNS and
how do I want this works as

383
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,250
given is this some dis

384
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,700
3 part identify manufacture the product
that the and

385
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:50,010
the unique serial number the tech sense
that to the reader

386
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:53,059
the reader now wants to look up
information on the product

387
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,160
which is thought that the manufacturer
site the unique

388
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,840
information is stored locally so on the
product that put the

389
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,290
discards the that serial number

390
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,590
I'm sense that remaining

391
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,720
piece of information that the
manufacturer the end to protect that the

392
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,640
into the 1s and don't necessarily doing
DNS query

393
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,169
results name to IP address right so

394
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:22,220
we wanna get an IP address for database
that we can get information from

395
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,760
and it does that by just looking up
which server

396
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,160
its associated with that manufacture id:
and then crowing that server

397
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,660
and and purring what what database is
associated with that product

398
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:39,350
hierarchical system again for the reason
of scale ability

399
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,790
billions of tax millions of readers if
it is going to be

400
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,370
use so we need something para people
here I'm

401
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,040
the onus is going to point to some
database given the IP address and under

402
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,580
the reader sends over that that identify
and gets the product specific

403
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,300
information

404
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,270
at services what EPC Global envisions
large-scale

405
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:04,780
systems to look like on here's an attack
on

406
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,168
that the our nasa privacy in treating
attack again ellis's

407
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:13,070
I'm roaming and attacks are being for it

408
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,678
and now D and the reading devices have
to you going to do

409
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,850
when asked and find a server that

410
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:23,090
that has the point that then okay so

411
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,510
they get the point that that the mic is
different service different free does my

412
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,050
tooth

413
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,060
actually they they will that they have
to because

414
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,480
for reasons of capability that that's
why we have DNS

415
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,860
eyes capability not me millions of free
disk on Tuesday

416
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,150
the same server so what if now the
attacker

417
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,210
controls this I'm

418
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,000
this server that information to slip up
from

419
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,220
on people see incoming Paris from

420
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,010
different ENSO right so and based on
that

421
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:59,370
having linking between reading the
cation DNS server

422
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,810
27 knows where alice is its deliver

423
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:06,560
to Utah for free that information
clarissa coming in from different

424
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,629
locations

425
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:11,650
and you can contract just face from that

426
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,770
this from dysentery has two assumptions
that

427
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,330
might not be legitimate and real relax
this assumption cent see that the text

428
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,020
so worth

429
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,970
the first assumption being that the
taker dust control one of these

430
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,900
service now it's kind of like please
since

431
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,990
every small manufacturer who who somehow
is involved

432
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:37,750
without a pretty will need their own
servers so 10+2 thought everybody has

433
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,000
X is 280 can hack into one and

434
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,200
the sex is something is that we can we
can

435
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,220
give Alice attack that that

436
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:52,040
results to that server that might be
less liked it so we would really have to

437
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,889
22 taca right I'm

438
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,030
really likes those in advance to take on
the INS

439
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,149
in which again Ellis I'm

440
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:05,320
is carried by reading device

441
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,649
the reading device looks up to
information and CNNs

442
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,880
returns the pointer right for us to do
to decrying

443
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:16,220
DNS server and then back to the reader

444
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,409
and notice to take place is based on
something that I've seen by

445
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:25,040
Dan Kaminsky last year who has seen than
for Minsky's talk last year

446
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,700
now where he played around with the NS
on

447
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,820
so what what he did was he bit you the
bill the list of all the NSF

448
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,689
and I'm I mean Aldean so is he just sent
out first to all

449
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,720
IP addresses possible and

450
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,960
look whether there was in DNS server on

451
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,559
what you use this list for was when that
this only

452
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,158
on on the city's at the rootkit and Sony
claimed

453
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:55,370
this only so few computers infected the
query all these DNS service

454
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,460
all publicly accessible DNS service for
whether

455
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,809
the that domain name of that rootkit

456
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:05,230
was cashed and its cash flow like an
hour

457
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:08,929
something maybe 10 minutes that that's
different for different names

458
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,429
so what he found that there's more
servers that that catch that name

459
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,409
then Sony would admit computers were
infected

460
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:23,040
right so what what we can use this
attack for now

461
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,230
that own that did

462
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,360
once we did resolve another for the tech

463
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,130
was that system I'm the the information
is cash for some

464
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,790
time period I'm on all DNS service

465
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,720
on the way to to the DNS server that
information actually came from

466
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,040
so an attacker can now very different
DNS service for whether that piece of

467
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,850
information

468
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,909
is cash right it's a totally passive
attack be done from

469
00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,679
true any computer we didn't help that we
didn't

470
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,800
touch anything to others which is ask

471
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,940
different DNS service whether they cash
that that record

472
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,470
and a scenario could be mmm

473
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,710
say who uses EZ Pass who knows EZ Pass

474
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,909
so they already use are for the
technology active text for

475
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:17,990
more reading range but let's say that
they would

476
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,630
for some reason start probing arafat the
text for

477
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,760
state governmentally induced
surveillance all

478
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,230
whatever I'm if we

479
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,649
now had their unique car

480
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:35,840
and the car being four wheels to have
our for the tax already

481
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,720
the car itself may be due model number
if we knew this discard alice is Carter

482
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,110
and easy has passing through each of
these gates would resolve

483
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:49,110
the name all these tax would just carry
the DNS service

484
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,490
at these locations for was a vacation
these

485
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,250
Fife records right so we could

486
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,419
we could by just sending of you can ask
for is every

487
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,280
5 for 10 minutes no where alice is
driving

488
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,470
okay well

489
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,230
to conclude on

490
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,909
the physical layer there's no hope
whatsoever that we could

491
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:21,260
ever not to leak any information

492
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,460
text will be distinguishable and if you
only get out

493
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,760
might say to bits breaking the takes
into four groups small ones in the big

494
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,870
ones too wet to send some other groups
you get to princeton

495
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,409
around at the tree protocol we've seen
that chart

496
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,200
you get another 45 its that's enough for
from the tech so

497
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,090
DT's bias Canada and then to system I
okay that's

498
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,399
just very naive to think we can used to
be an ass

499
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,000
for reasons of scale without much of a
change

500
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,450
and on use

501
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,210
are for the on that it will leak
information and

502
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,820
and if you if we only program up front
and

503
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,270
as an hour for the application and then
use infrastructure that exists

504
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:09,120
that's not gonna work privately

505
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,820
I'm only forces that I can see that
would

506
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,310
and foster for the privacy this three of
them first

507
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,418
would be like a slave ship California
for example

508
00:31:20,419 --> 00:31:24,050
has law legislation this year belief
that

509
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:28,389
this allows the the use of our for the
and governmental ID's

510
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,620
including drivers license and all that
but it's only for the next two years

511
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,230
and they will reconsider so there there
is hope that lawmakers

512
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,370
understand that the problematic and and
we'll work on that

513
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:44,710
maybe not pick up on the second force
would be a customer demand

514
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,540
the people say we're not gonna buy
moment anymore unless he

515
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,760
the country is to kill the Texas do
something else to it

516
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,800
I don't think that's going to work with
people don't care

517
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:01,120
people use credit cards ID

518
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,880
spread this said those that focus would
be on

519
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,630
corporate intelligence something that

520
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:12,580
many companies haven't thought about it
yet that the threats would be

521
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,600
that say some target employees walk
through Walmart

522
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,260
twice a day scans all that all that ails
Isles for which products they have on

523
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:21,820
stock

524
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,770
said on they would see you how much they
sold from morning till the afternoon

525
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,490
today they could from get internal
business data

526
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,900
I if companies understand that this
thread Texas

527
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,230
the company's might requested an that
and legislation

528
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,900
I really don't we to two options that I
C that we will get

529
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:45,400
are for the privacy well sanctuary

530
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:48,720
so much for your attention and are we
having to take some questions now

531
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,720
what

532
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,000
so multilayer problems for with the
privacy

533
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,700
it seem like third

534
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,330
you know other than the protocol where
there is no privacy

535
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:12,840
ya at recess so well

536
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,600
on the product to lay out there is no
privacy use it he's a research results

537
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,210
things that

538
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:20,710
we academia wat one is see

539
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:24,430
nobody pace an extra sense percent for
that yet

540
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm research has not really been done

541
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,140
the other few plus that there is no
office

542
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:38,140
straightforward solutions to be on Ando

543
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,460
some states are going to using our these

544
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,220
licenses he said consideration am

545
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,700
if this enforcing use things

546
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,100
being consequences for jamming

547
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,500
signals if you do now information
jamming

548
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,890
the same oranges blocking like me

549
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,810
wall blocking it from from you can block
it

550
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,490
what you can also do is from you're not
required

551
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,800
to to have working taken your ID's
European passports I'm from germany mike

552
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,820
has put hasn't

553
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,000
are for detecting it there is

554
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,020
on manufacturing time to put one in that
doesn't mean that once it has bought it

555
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,000
still has to work two seconds off my

556
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,480
wave do a good job there said passports
a valid for 10 years

557
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,510
I I don't believe many are for the text
will

558
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:33,280
work for ten years the the connection
between the tip and antennas kinda

559
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,250
Prattsville and that's gonna break at
some point so you could just be that

560
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:41,330
processor yeah those just curious about
that because you know

561
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,918
think if you have a long people

562
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,759
with our readies new pic Singh and
suddenly some ways

563
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,740
harassing look suspicious mmm

564
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,220
best bet that might that might be the
case and that yeah

565
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,670
that the your double check that the
border crossing

566
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:03,700
if you are for the tech isn't working
properly yeah but

567
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,430
jamming to come back to your first
question jamming is a legal separate

568
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,460
device that operates in these
frequencies

569
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,140
does need some FCC approval

570
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,220
yeah and they won't approve died

571
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,410
any further questions come up here

572
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,790
if you have a question what about the
possiblity

573
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,890
duplicate RFID since forgeries for

574
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:31,270
got news the on I'm company says

575
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,470
you let that that now use

576
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:39,320
come yourself if you take the track
everything I the more companies like

577
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,030
Prada

578
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,520
who who wants to put our for the Texans
hand and opposes

579
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,180
anti to it if you make them clone

580
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,520
resistant basically day so far rely on

581
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,430
that not understanding our friendly
technology nobody can make it take that

582
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,600
sends out the same number

583
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,860
sure that can so that's that the issue
of are for the security

584
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,870
you can use the same protocols to
tropical the privacy

585
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm protocol 0 that I that I showed you

586
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,569
from not only

587
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:14,480
0 this allows

588
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,110
tracking it also guarantees security

589
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,540
because you prove that you have to keep
right so

590
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,920
its that there to respond realize

591
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,350
on the secrecy of the key for both
privacy but also for

592
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:32,620
authenticity yeah so it is it is
possible and privacy

593
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,560
so far seems like the biggest challenge
if you chief privacy

594
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,200
automatically get authenticity have two
part question

595
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,870
first off on the like passive jamming or
having a random number generator tag

596
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,400
are those of are the tax themselves FCC

597
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,220
there to the SEC certified or zone the
broadcaster boxes

598
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,600
the readers that had to be SEC usually
you get a verification whole system

599
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,880
there's there's no company that just
makes our for the text that they're all

600
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,990
always selling the whole package

601
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,110
but said that FCC approval

602
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm basically sex was a you

603
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,730
you stay the lower certain thresholds of

604
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:21,260
rate radio ways and since that reading
device

605
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,620
last out lot of energy and to take on me
response very very silent

606
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,990
that there's no way in which you could
build and nor for the take that

607
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,200
doesn't get FCC approval yet so if
you're more concerned with

608
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,250
with reading ranges and making the
reader s hopeful

609
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,280
and the second question it was about the
encryption systems

610
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,600
I error checking that's going to be cut
throwing a lot of problems if you have

611
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,009
to if they're not getting

612
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,120
accurate back from attacks here

613
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:53,029
the readers are yeah all sorts of
problems Eric taking

614
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,340
I'm in most and that's that's that's a
level below to product a level

615
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:00,940
like that data link layer which then
again hit me

616
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,480
information that there's a problem there
sure yes so you would

617
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,480
you would but some rid read them and
Seanad

618
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,620
submit some of its to make sure its
understood well

619
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,880
questions about the power ring system
%uh I think they plastered with RF and

620
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,040
minutes rectified in a in the
transcripts

621
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,830
of that DC power from the rectified
right stuff

622
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:26,900
is is there any frequency range at the
youth

623
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,420
that's common 4424 the place I think the
EZ Pass issues use 900 megahertz

624
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,930
there is tax that use 900 megahertz more
common is certain point five six

625
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,460
megahertz

626
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:41,870
thats thats to I so

627
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:44,970
for the info for three standard that
Phillips entries

628
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,190
basically I'm the that the trade-off

629
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,920
was low and high frequencies is

630
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,120
to the higher you go in your frequencies

631
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,420
I'm that the more costly attackers

632
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,660
but that long after reading my interest
so the cheapest

633
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,879
takes the ones in the car key for
example they use

634
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,240
125 killer but they only

635
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,790
that they must only be extremely close
posted a review you stick the key into

636
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,700
T you're driving right so you're talking
few centimetres that

637
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,950
in the 900 megahertz range we had about
8

638
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:27,060
meters that we can achieve

639
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,340
we have seen the the 17

640
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,100
into it in there if the card then f8c
cheaper

641
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,810
is done by the

642
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:39,470
need infusion and the manufacturer and
the sarin number so

643
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:42,740
the verification is done via the DNS or
whatever

644
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:48,110
X there no sees them okie for polluting
the that's sort of the

645
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,330
X they're not check for to about the the

646
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,340
is it even possible to have larger

647
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,370
feel older in the cheap itself for so

648
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,480
further data aretha only

649
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,130
readable not write a book can be used
without

650
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:07,480
and the extensive that it that is
certainly possible

651
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,380
what we see for example rings isolate
what these in the larger baku taan 128

652
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,220
minute when they can store also

653
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,460
expiration date or whatever inside
without an external

654
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,640
that is certainly possible that do so

655
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,850
so-called contactless smart card
solutions so you have a big chip

656
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:30,660
usually the credit card something and he
you get really close to read %uh so

657
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,259
there's no

658
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:34,930
no problem is powering they have up to
64 killer

659
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:39,540
by of of beta stories so in applications
such as public transportation

660
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,240
invaders a actively sought Unitech if
you get

661
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,630
like it transportation cut from Tokyo on

662
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:49,910
became you can see a record of two lusty
away where you

663
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,390
got onto the metro and where you left
and that's not even encrypt it's

664
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:54,620
everybody can't

665
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,230
image so you got that but it's expensive

666
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,460
we're talking twenty dollars I 441

667
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:07,830
maybe 530 but not ascent never do you
ever see a point where

668
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,360
the computational power on the chip is
able to keep up with

669
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:14,940
Moore's Law just normal PC I'm

670
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,620
in cases like the Johns Hopkins work on
TI Houston Texans

671
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,089
pass yeah where there's so little
computing

672
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,320
are under the end-user crappy
proprietary algorithm forty

673
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,800
key modern PCs are now able to build the
table

674
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,480
possible lookups for tag noted good
question

675
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,710
I'm the most law is certainly ballot for

676
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:41,360
for all silicon including our footy
takes meaning that every 18-month

677
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,380
you get twice as many transistors for
the same size

678
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:47,470
what Waterford manufactures do now

679
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:51,240
different right they they take the same
number of transistors

680
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,200
for for a smaller package quote quote
holler yeah amputation power

681
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,420
is the country's was we might hit some
some

682
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,910
lower limit that where handling of the

683
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:08,140
of two tiny tiny takin if to if it had
to contend that you have to pack it all

684
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,150
that that's

685
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,700
that there's phillips's also that say

686
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,710
there floating techniques were with it
chip

687
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,720
loads and some liquid to contend in this
handbook

688
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,380
itself that that cool headed lower limit
once you hit that limit you come

689
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,460
bill smaller and most law kicks in again

690
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,690
then you get twice as many transistors
for the same price

691
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,580
yes at that point we can't put more
sophisticated security

692
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,040
and i'm just wondering if they're ever
going to reach a point where

693
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,600
are a pretty chips are able to give you
this

694
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,260
certain level security is required not
be

695
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:48,450
like Atik six years later after the
deployment system

696
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,950
yeah it seems UK

697
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:55,450
you can you get more longevity in any
case

698
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,740
and are afraid to take us to the complex
kitty

699
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,210
on on the order of 5,000 gates at the
moment

700
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,190
and there's an implementation by to
University of cops and

701
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:11,480
Austria that bills and a yes pfeiffer
with three South Gate C if I sell ready

702
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,670
and you at another 3,000 you a YES on
the tech

703
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,050
so that we're talking half

704
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,640
of more cost fifty percent more now that
is certainly possible yes

705
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,609
absolutely fascinated

706
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:31,020
number village idiot on this topic arm
but I'm wondering about connecting

707
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,170
improvised explosive devices to reading
RFID

708
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,660
is so I wanna blow up every Buick
LeSabre that passes or

709
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:41,529
every M-one tanks where are we on that
I'm

710
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:45,560
the American press but as far as I
understand it

711
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm doesn't mean they I'm access control

712
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,320
so the reader doesn't have to prove its
legitimate

713
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,550
and no but I'm talking about automobiles
automobiles okay so

714
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,980
an improvised explosive device is
something that blows up the tank as it

715
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:00,770
goes past

716
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,720
so where are we in relation to be able
to read specific RFID

717
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,170
from the side of the road so that all
the american effort to put logistics

718
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,650
information to its vehicles is in fact
empowering the enemy I

719
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:16,880
reading range is typically I'm

720
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,490
to me this for foremost commonly used
texan

721
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,500
logistics four years same

722
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,590
that they that the radio

723
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,170
characteristics don't change we might

724
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:35,850
tweak it a little bit better antennas
all that may be 34 meters but

725
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,600
the the company's frequencies 13 points
%uh megahertz

726
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,920
they don't know so it's not a major
threat at this point well there's a

727
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:43,590
thread

728
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,490
as I said passports that this right
being that it deployed bomb somewhere

729
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:47,840
and

730
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,760
wat 2 a.m. an American War spy having
America 0

731
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,890
yeah and you

732
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,290
again arm now to an evil side of my
brain

733
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,930
I've always wondered the possibilities
in

734
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:10,560
you're talking about kill codes on tax
an thank the couple seconds on my quiz

735
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,920
kill anything like that the
possibilities just

736
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,740
overpowering tags: blown out the caster
on

737
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:21,190
with something a backpack mounted
battery transfers 0 click

738
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:24,360
and your territory systems dipped

739
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,050
easy yeah keep text very easy

740
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:31,590
with devices that don't get FCC approval
but

741
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:35,120
that you commit other crimes anyway and
it does well some like that

742
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,670
yeah know it's it's easy you can easily
overpowered him you need like a

743
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,710
maybe 15-20 what sender

744
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:46,460
and you kill X that they could become
for measures to that if that

745
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,810
that became the huge threat vandalism in
like wal-mart

746
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:53,970
than that day that they say anything in
the gap but close enough

747
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:57,090
that the only countermeasure really
would be to have a

748
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:01,350
resistor on the take that could burned
extra energy

749
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:04,839
projects with the cost for tag just its

750
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,480
resistance sex with hot to manufacture
in silicon see if you don't wanna

751
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,460
put and external transistor we have been
doubling the price

752
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,710
to and and even then wasting their

753
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,270
the rate if weakens the extra however if
you don't wanna destroy you take with

754
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,560
means

755
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,980
you create he tried so you overheat the
tag and then it breaks

756
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,320
after minute just not in a second that

757
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,460
there is really no good it kinda measure
that that would protect

758
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,110
tech

759
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,240
that was basically my questions are but
a moving onto

760
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,940
temporary I countermeasures to exposing
your privacy

761
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,950
you mention wrapping in for oil

762
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,020
as one type arm

763
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,509
are there any others that you can share
are how much

764
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:59,650
does it take to attack for example a
credit card from

765
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,090
sending its signal outcome you have to

766
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,240
what types in sales with your when

767
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,520
could you put are rapid Lori in the case
of the credit card

768
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,090
after that the Harvard you take this
just in addition I've never seen a

769
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:14,610
take-out

770
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:18,690
I'm not work I could actually pay as a
den at ExxonMobil

771
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,440
session so if you don't want to
functionality and it just comes with it

772
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,810
then microwave again

773
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:27,850
but if you if you really want to
functionality but only sometimes

774
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:32,110
you wrap it for that that's the only
solution I'm well

775
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,150
to Justin fireworks and any

776
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:39,110
any metal any metal yeah and buy/sell

777
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:42,150
on that they sell wallets that have a
metal

778
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:47,329
oil in it already yeah really

779
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:49,589
I was just gonna plug they're downstairs

780
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:56,589
to a boat over

781
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,829
loading a in their FA the time is 10 for
the thug

782
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:05,069
will eventually AP Israeli tweak the

783
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:08,319
the light air or whatever

784
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,880
cool the them as it without the

785
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,089
externalities can use in a

786
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:18,250
in the the israeli 3 the the light

787
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:21,339
because the is have it generates

788
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:26,420
know a lot of the the radio noise

789
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,420
all around can be the Angels over to see

790
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:33,440
use in that way so and

791
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,849
needed having you it's a little charges
near

792
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:42,540
the the cheap why can eventually

793
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,750
as he was asking for you without using a

794
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:48,760
for portable microwave on unlikely

795
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,369
unlikely that devices that are not
suppose to

796
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,609
to emit radio waves but that just do it
anyway like computers

797
00:48:56,609 --> 00:49:00,869
they have much lower threshold on

798
00:49:00,869 --> 00:49:03,920
on committee privacy on a meeting radio

799
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,160
so if if reading device can survive

800
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,308
an RFID if the Aphrodite I can't survive
are for the reader

801
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:15,829
it can certainly survive all external
noise yeah

802
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:18,920
any more questions

803
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:22,680
well thanks a lot for the discussion I
was
