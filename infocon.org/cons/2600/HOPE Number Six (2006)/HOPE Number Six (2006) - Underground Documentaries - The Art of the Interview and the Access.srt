1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,290
go presenter and Gillian McArdle we both
fall today under the heading of

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,220
documentary filmmakers

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,960
I'm just finished my first

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,660
gentleman is finished his second so he
kicks my ass

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,230
today's talk is called arm several
things

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,120
arts called underground documentaries I
think there was another name wasn't

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,850
there something like putting together

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,440
yeah your sandwich the relevant really
the art of

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,560
sandwich making at the art of something
the art of

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,080
anyway the point is it's about
documentaries the process by which one

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,960
makes them why you would want to make
them

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,180
and what things came up in the process
of our works

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,320
so just to talk about what we did arm

14
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,600
I made a film well one film called BBS

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,790
the documentary this is a film about

16
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:54,460
dial-up bulletin board systems of the
nineteen seventies eighties and nineties

17
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,980
this project started in 2001

18
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,610
I finished everything in the spring of
2005

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:06,500
on it ended up being five-and-a-half
hours

20
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,020
aid episodes has two hundred interviews
3 its 13 DVD's

21
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,420
and

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,560
and yeah so I was a 31-year-old
gentleman coming in I was a 35-year-old

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,729
wreck coming out a bit on my turn the

24
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:25,590
my project was the piracy documentary
which focused on

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,670
internet piracy and this consisted

26
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,690
interviews with create which was the
Canadian Recording Industry Association

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,880
and a bunch of others to get sorta all
angles on

28
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,140
that topic again those my second movie
first one was

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,659
a acid edge team in film on Computer
Basics

30
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,170
known as the end to show the and two

31
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,350
uint to UNT 0

32
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,780
and we probably should just mention a
web sites now just got the way I'm PBS

33
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,740
documentary dot com

34
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,979
and I am piracy documentary dot com

35
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,350
all one word yeah we all meet at night
so

36
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,959
the the first thing you gotta do when
people hear documentaries as

37
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,170
especially in the modern age where you
have

38
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,730
documentaries that are also polemics is
what exactly constitutes at the

39
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,470
documentary one of the debates that came
out above the thousands at a fair in

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,410
height 9/11 was whether or not

41
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,650
actually was a documentary and whether
or not it deserved any sort

42
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,650
love Oscar for it if you go and read the
Oscar

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,680
rules on what constitutes a

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,100
documentary is a and I'm

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,130
semi paraphrasing here it is In Motion
Picture

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,450
in which real life events represent
inspiration

47
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,650
an arc told through either recreation

48
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,760
actual footage or through um

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,540
exposition so

50
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,950
basically a mobile phone cam shot

51
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,950
is a documentary and technically Texas
Chainsaw Massacre is a documentary

52
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,980
both are based on real events

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,119
took a few liberties here and there

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,650
so documentary so you can't fall into
those kinda debates

55
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:20,459
to myself a documentary is simply a film
that informs you

56
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,390
in some way about whether or not it does
entertainment along the way is a bonus

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,890
are the idea is at the and a bit you

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,549
learned it's something that has some V
get used to you

59
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,799
whether or not the actual thing you
learn is

60
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,470
I'd never wanna hear about this again
and I should avoid things named

61
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,590
this on your definition of your own

62
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,890
um yeah actually no I don't have a dish
finishes

63
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,120
my own a basically anything that
documents

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,080
in any way there has did relevance is
not an issue with that it could be

65
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,870
completely irrelevant but as long

66
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,400
as it's truthful it constitutes a
documentary my books

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,700
for an attempt at truth what your age
again

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,569
my work with your age how will you I am
21 as a

69
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:14,159
today okay yes it is there is there
someone with the acre meister in the

70
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:14,599
house

71
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,450
um I am 35

72
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,430
as if not today %ah just so we
understand that were coming from two

73
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,770
different positions

74
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,030
when I was 21 I wasn't doing what he was
doing at all

75
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,180
on and I didn't start doing anything
involving

76
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,419
quote-unquote professional filmmaking
until August 31

77
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,750
now I got a film degree but then I
realized that

78
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,770
the film business socks I didn't want
anything to do with it so I ended up

79
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,620
going into computers which P bitter

80
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,950
and was because of that well-paying job
that I was able to consider making a

81
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,479
film

82
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,520
so it's important to the market when I'm

83
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,539
talking about these films that my film
was a hobby

84
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:57,979
om I didn't sit there shooting
everything saying

85
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:00,740
is this gonna turn me money is this
going to get me something it was like

86
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,520
okay well maybe today was fun

87
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,510
maybe it wasn't fun but I wasn't sitting
there saying if I don't get the shot

88
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,140
we're gonna lose money and I'm going to
go under I have to make my house payment

89
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,479
I always made sure when I shot my film
that I never

90
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,800
let it consume my life to the point that

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,650
I was betting the farm because that's
when you make really poor decisions

92
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,370
in everything when you sit there and
save yourself I don't do this right

93
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:29,729
I I'm going to fail so I better do the
shortcut

94
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,180
was gonna notice and that averages for
them

95
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,210
so when you're making a documentary film

96
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:43,849
or decide you want to does anyone here
have been interest in making one

97
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,990
excellent I'm better than NYU and
cheaper

98
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,390
anybody here but see so I was asking
that one

99
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,430
anybody here meet a documentary film
Hall yeah

100
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,159
us was it was a good on as I get lately
goods though it

101
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,330
we got to goods we got to goods one I
wish I wasn't there

102
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,990
I excellent porn doesn't count as
documentary

103
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,710
okay and I was on the one alright so

104
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,870
my question is you know why did you want
to make your film why would you wanna

105
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,969
make a documentary

106
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,539
and that's an important concept why what
do you think is there so

107
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:26,919
I get I get calls now because I actually
made it through the colon

108
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:30,159
a film production and people say what's
it like up there

109
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:34,149
and they often come to me and say

110
00:06:34,149 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm going to make a hacking documentary

111
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,190
and it's like okay it's like saying I'm
gonna be in a band

112
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,779
and we're gonna play rock music like
okay that's

113
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,990
your alright why are you making this
hacking documentary

114
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,479
and often it's I am a hacker

115
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,810
so I'll make a hacker documentary or

116
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,370
your other people be like I'm a musician
I wanna make a music documentary and so

117
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,870
on and the question becomes

118
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,209
there you know you know you can save
yourself a lot of time

119
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:08,390
well okay this to flip sides to write
you can lose

120
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,740
out on a lot of life by asking too many
questions you can

121
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,080
gain back a lot of your life by asking
too many questions

122
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,890
so you ask the fundamental question why
am I doing this so why did you decide to

123
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,140
make a documentary

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,130
we woke up the first one the first one
he shot with a mobile phone

125
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,010
but just in case anyone is wondering
about like whether not get it on B&H

126
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,039
Photo and dropped ten grand

127
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,520
yet equipment is not a prerequisite to
making a documentary you have to have

128
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,049
the luck for it in the love the topic

129
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,539
if the topic is an interesting to you
let odds are

130
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,180
unless you paid for it at which point
the love because one for money

131
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,029
I it won't be a good film you have to
really

132
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:51,440
like it euros likewise you like the
PBS's yes

133
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,539
I was an important part of your life I
very much

134
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:58,740
liked computer-related things computer
security for the first in

135
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,260
for this last one just the wearer's
world and how it worked

136
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,550
and that without that keeping

137
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,779
it all falls apart on in my case

138
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,190
I noticed that it was getting to be 2001

139
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,760
and nobody had made the time-life series
of PBS's

140
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,959
so I guess it was time for me to do it
so

141
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,690
i sat down and spent my time line like I
said was a little weird was for

142
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,409
years so it was six months a research

143
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:31,690
three years or shooting and about eight
months ago editing production

144
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,860
finishing things off screaming at an
idiot

145
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,149
asshole record company and you know
clearing things out

146
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:43,149
om so for me it was a case over

147
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:46,690
what's my story here let's go actually
find out you know you

148
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,740
you enter into a story let's say you're
going to do a story on the whole

149
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,680
conference right you come in with an
idea you can come as an attendee

150
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,959
you can come in as an organizer those
are two very separate stories

151
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,420
you can come in is somebody who wants to
speak that's another story

152
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,589
each time there's all these hundreds of
stories that could be going on

153
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,470
as a filmmaker you are recording for
documentaries

154
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,640
something some I based in reality in
fact you're not

155
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,880
every time you in the camera in a
different direction you're making it

156
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,450
editing decision

157
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,120
so something's going on behind you
you're not getting that shot

158
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,630
you're getting the twirl leave blurry
shot

159
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,980
so a you have to make sure that you
kinda know where things are going

160
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,600
but on the other hand sometimes you have
to change midstream

161
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,820
so when I started out I knew I kinda
wanna Bolton boards but I didn't know

162
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:36,180
where it was going to go

163
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,310
so then it turned out that I want to do
something on Fido net

164
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,709
and I want to do something on NC art and
all these obscure subjects were had to

165
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,980
start tracking people down

166
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,029
um for your piracy documentary you
started working

167
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,550
with places that I would never set foot
in

168
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,689
like the Canadian recording Association
yet

169
00:09:56,689 --> 00:10:00,000
de ahi yeah how okay

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,529
I Sanchez well this is important because
when I did my film my film was meant to

171
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,610
be a

172
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,100
%uh narrative about this history because
my problem was that

173
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,079
nobody really kind of had down the
history of Fido net

174
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,399
truly from the voices of the people who
did it

175
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,480
but there's a lot of people who have a
lot of voices in piracy

176
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,990
yeah owed it most definitely so for
instance

177
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,569
when it started off with tria on

178
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:30,240
you've got this one perspective than
this year you up to ten other

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,610
perspectives that

180
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,680
these 10 contacts that you have it Voice

181
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,160
no what was the reason for which you you
in now like this

182
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,300
be in the same room as those people you
know it's funny

183
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,779
um when I think love these so you know

184
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:48,550
up it's only subject matters when I did
my hacking

185
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,600
episode my role was no law enforcement

186
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,420
know covering too much and busts no
talking to reporters

187
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,019
because I didn't need that they get
plenty of voice

188
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,230
yeah my concern was I wanted in Apple to
Cracker

189
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,079
who nobody's heard of except for that he
was up cracking up

190
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,750
game 20 years ago and I want to get all
those people

191
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,889
and I figured you know life can go ahead
and criticize them but I want to get

192
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,209
their voice first

193
00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,230
and so I would say year

194
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,470
in my case there is a blind spot there

195
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,069
because I never sought out the law
enforcement perspective

196
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:28,469
yeah and does such a neat thing about
documentaries is that

197
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,759
even though you might hear about a topic
rate and you might hear about certain

198
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,620
perspectives that city create which

199
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,639
UN loves to hate are there are a double
hit

200
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,050
a here in the US on the advantages you
doing a documentary is that you can see

201
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,819
cat perspectives that no one really a

202
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,199
had before so frances the RIAA we always
hear about

203
00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,769
a hoe the China crackdown and
downloading and typically journalists

204
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,100
trying to get that very shelhah
perspective

205
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,970
so you as a documentary filmmaker and
they keep referring back to the pie sed

206
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,009
akhmed too because it wouldn't familiar
with

207
00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:03,810
that you as a documentary filmmaker have
the option a yes going for that common

208
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:04,519
voice

209
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,999
but the uncommon perspective there in
the questions I had a

210
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:11,509
last these guys that I had met during
the trip the hand

211
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,230
really heard them before because
journalists really

212
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,470
do not have the expertise that you get a
separate the

213
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,810
typically have to cover all these
stories and so they have a lot of

214
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,540
general knowledge in a lot of separate
things

215
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,998
but the advantage that you guys have is
that you're an expert

216
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,999
in your own special field so you have
the upper hand so when you come along

217
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,509
with people that a

218
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:38,040
are on the you know well trodden Road
you're able to go of that enabled us

219
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,069
questions and

220
00:12:39,069 --> 00:12:42,519
that really helps you documentary and
getting that hopefully

221
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,410
new perspective my producer only stopped
me

222
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,719
from going to two different interviews
on

223
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,959
their face %ah one of them was

224
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,459
traveling to a ranch to interview with
fellow who ran a white power PBS

225
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:00,329
theory being that a jewish filmmaker
should probably not go along with this

226
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,509
camera onto a white

227
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:04,800
our ranch I am

228
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,360
I'm for getting the other one but it
also involved weaponry

229
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,670
I but on generally

230
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,790
the the toughest part love any
documentary

231
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,259
is finding the people that you wish to
speak to you

232
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:22,550
and by that I mean it's very easy to
find people who give an opinion

233
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:28,639
there what I call the documentary I call
them the fallacies the editing fallacies

234
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,649
I have stupid names for them I call the
monkey dance

235
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,160
I call them bobbling and so on and
basically with a workout to

236
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,839
is and and you do this but everyone does
this and i ended up almost doing it a

237
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:40,779
few times

238
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,509
monkey dance is where you make somebody
do the things they do in front of you

239
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:48,199
on the camera the problem with that is
that they're not actually doing it

240
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:51,139
they're doing it for the camera so you
get people working on a computer and

241
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:52,240
they're doing this

242
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,279
because they're not looking at it but
hey you wanna shot at the person doing

243
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:55,999
this

244
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:59,189
is what I call cakewalk which is where
you make a person walk down the street

245
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:03,469
while other people walk around them and
you put their voice and overly over it

246
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,790
this allows them to go on some endless
useless exposition

247
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,290
and be somewhat interesting you can stay
with the girls ass next to the guys

248
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,129
walking

249
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,499
then there's what I call razzle-dazzle
bling which is where you take a macro

250
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,829
lens in a min directly at some small

251
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:22,100
bit of the person's life whether it's a
stamp or PC their keyboard or something

252
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,610
and go along it very slowly again this
allows exposition

253
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,649
when your problems in the documentary is
that film is

254
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:32,920
not print film is not able to give you

255
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,860
the massive print on the other hand film
tends to be slightly less boring because

256
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,939
it's only forty minutes of your life
that's going instead of 10 days trying

257
00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:41,300
to reduce 2000 paged

258
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,410
home on its

259
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:48,019
shallow but it's also very effective so

260
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:52,689
Italian think it is a knife stab instead
of a nice full operation

261
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,649
getting there and you feel it and it's
done as opposed to slowly

262
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:00,720
the story you on so

263
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,959
there's a couple other cases and one of
them

264
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,490
is what I call man on the street what
that means is you walk down with your

265
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:07,899
camera

266
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,879
the risk war and you basically charge it
somebody in go

267
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,720
solo GM aw go

268
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,379
well people will do one several things
probably not thinking about GMOs

269
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,660
that point so probably they're going to
say it but it'll do with geo is

270
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,800
or they're gonna go with arm is that a
supermarket

271
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,869
or they'll say hey yeah I'm he GM Oh
Lord you'll be really lucky or get

272
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:34,829
someone who go chill mode Jesus Christ
not dropped a briefcase and take your

273
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:37,399
shirt off and screaming at you

274
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,930
then you in the editing room unsure how
to do

275
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,240
could get from point A to point B flip
back to

276
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,180
a buncha people on the street spouting
off what they know which is nothing

277
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,529
of about the subject but you get from
one place to another

278
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:55,180
and that's a major problem when you're
tellin call recorder story trying to

279
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,999
turn reality to our stories the

280
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:00,089
fundamental problem this is why when you
have documentaries

281
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,949
that are about %ah certain subjects and
then you compared to a film

282
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:07,160
made on the same subject offer so
there's a lot more fucking but beyond

283
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,050
that

284
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,660
you end up with all these kind of things
where they say oh yeah that guy

285
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:16,069
that guy was these four guys because
those four people are 25 percent

286
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:17,230
interesting

287
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,019
so they've press them together into one
got so if you know the original story

288
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,899
it's not as compelling but if we do know
the store if you don't know the story

289
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,670
it's pretty compelling wish I was there
it's pretty interesting on killing your

290
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,339
honor

291
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,519
the um let's let's just

292
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,850
again he does somebody shortcuts in the
piracy documentary

293
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,889
this means he's more professional than I
am

294
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:42,279
%uh you know there's a lot of risks I
took when I interviewed people

295
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:46,730
I intentionally did not ask them to do
anything related to what they do

296
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,959
I just simply talk to them and became up
to me to make the interviews as

297
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,329
compelling as possible

298
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:54,470
that was what we call a double down bet

299
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,269
that's where I'm gonna sit there eight
months later

300
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:03,089
wishing I had a time machine so I could
punch myself in the nuts

301
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:06,490
and there are cases love me

302
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:09,819
I'm on film I'm editing film

303
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:14,399
that has me in it and i cure myself
going I'm so sorry for that

304
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,030
and I'm going I forgive you because I
know

305
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,809
when I'm shooting it that unlike all I'm
gonna be so angry at myself

306
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,780
users to use is the guy out with the
camera was really enjoyable

307
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,309
really athletic having fun going around
getting the shot the news the poor

308
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,960
crammed asshole with the soda

309
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,429
who stuck there for 24 hours at a
stretch trying to turn

310
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:37,429
this dog shit into something relating to
this story

311
00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,530
and that stop and thats part of it

312
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,559
and I'd just jump out of our sequence

313
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,710
that can't be discounted the time that
it takes

314
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,970
do these things is very important
because if you sit in an IRC channel

315
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,710
talking about your documentary

316
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,970
that fault interest for people for about
14 minutes

317
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:00,360
and then after that their back to the
dawn jokes and

318
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,570
when you try to take energy and try to
get ideas from these people they're like

319
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,689
why are you still talking about that

320
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,940
that was Monday it's wednesday so

321
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,220
it took me eight months edited

322
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,010
after spending there were literally
people who I interviewed

323
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,640
who died because

324
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,650
time when are and by the time I'm
editing them

325
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,960
they're never gonna see what I did so
that

326
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
the that prime bit doesn't show up for
people who sing

327
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,500
in you know once I finished it in my
case it's five and a half hours they'll

328
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,920
slow you down but his film

329
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
will be between forty minutes to an hour
and a half so in an hour

330
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,930
that person will take their months and
months work

331
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,990
and go work and then turn over the
Teletubbies

332
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,480
workers are stone 6 so

333
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,480
you know you can't you you have to
understand that that

334
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,900
I mean all these little arts and things
have the secret part

335
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,450
writing has this marathon training has
this all this the part where you are

336
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,800
alone

337
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,830
the power to you and your product and
you are alone

338
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:11,830
and you are working on it and you know
it's going to be good but you've got so

339
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,389
much to go through

340
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,340
and that's when you can make the short
cuts because you like but I have to make

341
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,669
this festival

342
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,380
you know cuz there r 5,000 festivals
I've never

343
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,100
no such a ride to play in one festivals
like getting the IMDB

344
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,770
that's the good part by the way you
getting the IMDB

345
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,540
thats it you get the IMDB the neck with
a picture up by the way cost 50 bucks

346
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,580
to put your picture in the IMDB and you
can write about what a great guy you are

347
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,830
and then you can point to that and and
you get a cupcake

348
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,070
with the piracy documentary from

349
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,250
watching it like I said a

350
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,670
mmm when I had it I had my biases when
you went in

351
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:56,720
did you find any your biases changed 03
here

352
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,150
you mean they going in from the footage
during yesterday production like

353
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,520
what like after cuz you actually send
the room with the chantels

354
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,230
this yet when you interview people these
in my case your perspectives change

355
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,460
it's always good to go in there with
their lease some idea of what you're

356
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,260
gonna say

357
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,140
but the more you love you people the
more they fill you in on perspectives

358
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,030
you had not

359
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,440
imagine vectors you had not that about
so the thing changes by the interaction

360
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,440
that you're actually doing
post-production by you are probably some

361
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,070
wondered if it

362
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:31,909
a different person than you were before
mind you my topic is somewhat evermore a

363
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,830
subjective matter I mean DDS is somewhat
more

364
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,189
mean there's no one angry about PBS per
se today I Hope

365
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,370
so wrong I okay stand corrected

366
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,600
is before my time there was somebody who
I tried to interview

367
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,310
and he said sure this was them

368
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,629
okay fine I'll tell you this was the
gentleman created orchestra eighty does

369
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,610
anyone know what orchestra eighty is

370
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,620
one man knows what works for 80 is
excellent

371
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,680
you and I go somewhere and be alone the

372
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,900
om orchestra eighty system was in
musical system created for the TRS

373
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,710
eighty and what it was was basically
there was no sound and what this was was

374
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,680
a circuit

375
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,660
that could connect with that would allow
it to send sine wave C you could

376
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,310
actually get

377
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,850
basically voices in music in it around
the 1980 and onward

378
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:22,550
up period around that time and so
basically I'm if anyone's ever used

379
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,720
amigas and mods

380
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,240
or done tracking or anything we make
music you could do this in the early

381
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,090
eighties and I

382
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,370
was originally going to an episode
world's gonna have all these art things

383
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,820
always people who can I use computers
from art

384
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,179
and it ended up being just NCR cuz that
killed forty minutes which tells you

385
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,820
where my perspective one

386
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,909
I want to go interview this man he said
you betcha

387
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,370
sounds interesting and use in California

388
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,160
and I was staying at a friend's house in
California and I check my email cuz up

389
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,830
eight in the morning I gotta go
interview this guy in emails mingus hi

390
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,199
Jason

391
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,520
um I took all the equipment out love
mine

392
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,080
Caracas to lay it out so you can
interview me with me

393
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,120
and I realize looking at it that this is
what destroyed my marriage

394
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,780
that I spend all of my time with this
machinery

395
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,389
and ignored my wife and i got my child
and i no longer in my life

396
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,560
and I don't think I really wanna talk
about that anymore so I think I'm going

397
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,750
to cancel the interview and I think I'm
going to get rid of the stuff

398
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,850
so I wrote him back and said okay I
didn't run and say fuck you

399
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,120
the professional I will come back and
say totally understand please give that

400
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,020
stuff to a museum

401
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,530
and that's that Obama you know E

402
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:36,320
there are people in a subject you can't
just think about historical subject has

403
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,879
been gone

404
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,220
you can talk to somebody who watch
someone die

405
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,690
and they can be baby and they will be
there when they tell you

406
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,530
and you have to be very very careful
about that

407
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:53,040
during the documentary going to be 205
people generally they were happy

408
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,470
in one case I had some breakdown on
camera because he realized how much pain

409
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,900
it caused him

410
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,820
and you have two choices there you can
stop the interview you can keep rolling

411
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,939
I kept rolling

412
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,440
because I thought that it was vital

413
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,770
that people see what effect they had on
this man because he was perceived as a

414
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,200
very evil character

415
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,660
he was perceived as somebody who was
actually a big company destroying

416
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,840
someone's life

417
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,610
and in fact he was just another
businessman who discovered the world

418
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,750
wasn't what he thought it was in it made
a bad decision publicity and now he was

419
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,470
he did

420
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:28,320
and all he could be remembered for was
how much he was hated so he started

421
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,310
crying

422
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,480
and that's in my movie on and

423
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,980
he was the inventor of the arc format

424
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,810
and the reason you don't hear about the
art form and her but there's a format is

425
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,149
because at this

426
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,240
so sometimes in these films you find
yourself in a weird place it never

427
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,820
expected you would be

428
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,310
right I mean there's cases where as a
filmmaker

429
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,440
you followed someone and I mean what do
you do if you doing a film on somebody

430
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,710
in the guy some the lights up

431
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,710
just started doing a drug in front of
you

432
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:01,720
let's have even more fun not say he
injects that's even more fun at least

433
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,710
lighting up to let go but dudes just
rolling up talking to you and you just

434
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,780
fuckin sticks it right in the arm what
do you do you keep the footage

435
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,260
throughout the footage you talk to 'em
up don't do that please

436
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,790
you know especially if it's like a
milkman

437
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,690
you know what happens when like
someone's life kinda intersects with

438
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:22,160
yours

439
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,380
I had one case were interviewed %ah
someone and his wife threw me out of the

440
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,830
house

441
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,080
because om and I will not say his name

442
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,629
on he was busted involved with PBS and
sent to jail for each year

443
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,280
%uh that was back in the early 90's and
I was interviewing him in 2002

444
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,340
and his wife came into the room and said
what the hell is going on here

445
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,699
they said on just talking about the
Boston she's like no you're not

446
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,710
UART no we live here we live in the same
community you were busted in

447
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,250
the Chief of Police is the same chief of
police when you were busted

448
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,700
this guy's gonna leave and you are going
to have hell for our kids

449
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,810
get him out so I did the right thing he
had signed the

450
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,820
release already so I gave him the tapes
he had already recorded

451
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,720
and I gave him his release back and I
said if she ever change your mind fine

452
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,290
but if not

453
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,190
I'm outta here on the mention your name
again uses story though

454
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:19,340
but his um his his his wife's
perspective

455
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,409
trumps mine you're shooting history but

456
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:26,620
their living lives and you have to
respect that

457
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,040
%ah that said someone shooting up is
fuckin great footage so don't throw it

458
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:32,120
away is basically what I'm saying

459
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,130
I mean that's fuckin incredible dude
shot up in front if you put that in the

460
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,080
middle to be the guy shot up movie

461
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,790
a lot of people think back to
documentaries no go all that's the one

462
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:43,230
with the guy hit the wall documentary

463
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,180
it doesn't it's not the PBS documentary
it's the guy cried your the nerds

464
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,600
documentary

465
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:52,640
and thats you know there are moments
have that I'm thinking back to %uh that

466
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,100
film but when the ones in

467
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,160
inspired me up Penelope Spheeris a his
end of civilization it was part 21 heavy

468
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,870
metal

469
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:03,310
and is a film love I think it's more the
Motley Crue guys or something

470
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,740
and he's drunk and I mean not

471
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:11,010
the authors drunk there's drugs like I
had a drink and his truck like I'm of

472
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,320
broadband formaldehyde

473
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,790
and he was in formaldehyde and he was in
his little fuckin

474
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,420
a inner to and his mother's their their
interview with her mother

475
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,610
her mother is looking down at what is
essentially a pizza dead meat that used

476
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,720
to be her son

477
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,550
and be no peace process with this camera
run and he's going off and being a rock

478
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,649
star and she's a sitting there talking

479
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:35,380
saying I i don't even know what you are
and

480
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,820
to me will always be the inner tube fuck
and run from all the hydroxide our movie

481
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,810
at Skyway compelling shit yeah write
compelling shit

482
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,409
but day on to be at people who do you
say no and stuff like that that's going

483
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,880
to be anticipated

484
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,730
your prime reaction when someone does it
because you were talking about that

485
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,460
people's

486
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,600
declining interview being kicked out of
the house you cannot get upset at that

487
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:01,400
it's gonna happen and what you can do
those posted under perhaps give you info

488
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,280
on someone who could do an interview

489
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,260
to for instance a attended interviews
with 74 contacts

490
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,590
which 25 agreed well for the other 50
many said you know I thought of

491
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,840
but for those who didn't tell me too go
my own way

492
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,010
%uh they were kind enough to give me
context to people finally did interviews

493
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:23,360
and sometimes it's along paths ago
railroad with multiple stuff through a

494
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,370
sieve

495
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,090
I'll give you one example guys trying to
get the labels perspective rate

496
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,960
because they're the ones are mostly
doing all the action and so they're like

497
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,600
okay well we won't do

498
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,390
interviews but maybe you can try these
say go to these guys are like

499
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,530
that really next anyways long down the
road come to Korea

500
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,620
and by that time that had all these
people that are sorted belching for me

501
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,140
because they feel a bit better

502
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,370
and then I get an interview with korea
at which point you know they see me come

503
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,360
in the door and the

504
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,540
for you the interview with you break as
you get this

505
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,680
so it is another advantage being turned
down is that you can use those people

506
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,340
that someone as a reference

507
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,880
to if you walk into a room and I i was
just like this when I was interviewing

508
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,470
late

509
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,740
president like the Canadian RIAA and
like Canadian MPA

510
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,820
India they was a punk you doing here

511
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,030
well to do an interview and they have no
choice but say yes

512
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:18,530
so that's a oh noes can you actually be
a good thing it don't get upset

513
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,100
so when the it's been attributed the six
billion people a definite dates the

514
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:27,000
thirty-foot the phrase is the key in
filmmaking is honesty and once you can't

515
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,350
fake that you can get anywhere

516
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:35,610
a the person who most people are
surprised that injury was vinton surf

517
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,080
the evil overlord who controls the
Internet Obama his

518
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,530
interview basically came about because I
wrote him and said

519
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,290
p I'd like to interview you and he went

520
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,690
okay here's my secretary

521
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,390
and the secretary gave me a six page PDF
fun so you're gonna interview can't

522
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,130
answer

523
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:59,590
said come here goes your way here and
the new go to hearing to be loaded into

524
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,070
the

525
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,389
anaerobic chamber and then over here and
then anyway so I went there and he

526
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,270
was at behind his desk to set up I after
a buncha questions what PBS's

527
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,480
which we talked very little but BBS
isn't off we went

528
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,720
and that was it one hour later I was
outta there but I had my vinton surf

529
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,660
interview

530
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,260
and people have to realize that when a
person is famous

531
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,520
they often got famous cuz they talk to
people like you

532
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,610
and they talked to people like you all
the time all the time

533
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,320
altimetry later and they would talk to

534
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,689
anybody who would write down anything so
wherever that happened

535
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,550
they would go for and that never stops
so you're just another one of the

536
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,350
you're just another guy was gonna do it
and in fact they may not even remember

537
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,430
their interview with you because the
public at five more that week

538
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,160
with who who knows what you know it's
it's their own is not to say something

539
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,500
stupid in one that doesn't show up in
the others

540
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,500
but that's how they got there am I've
had people who said

541
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,180
no and then later I come back with okay
have done a hundred interviews we do it

542
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,930
and they go to the page with the list of
100 interviews not the photos Minho

543
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,010
okay you're serious aren't final do it
om

544
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,140
I've had to negotiate a few people who
were vaguely interested in it

545
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,800
and then later they said okay last one
was a guy who said

546
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,490
best answer ever okay you're probably
legitimate

547
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:21,630
but I really pulled a prank on somebody

548
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:27,810
so I think you might be him

549
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,760
and ice iro to him and said okay here's
my list interviews with all my photos

550
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,220
not

551
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,150
here's all the work I've done any work
back well if you're him

552
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,960
you've done an awful lot of work so
let's do it

553
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,800
I us and I've I'd never really asked to
what the hell did you do this guy

554
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,910
did you wake up naked enough football
stadium

555
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,660
you're really be that paranoid but
that's what he was

556
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,040
um you know a a my look my luck came
that I interviewed a lot of people who

557
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,800
nobody had ever interviewed i'd
interviewed the of item that was a

558
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,510
network and everyone that interview the
guy

559
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,590
created network I interview the guy we
talked to

560
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:08,220
I call them they might might oh my god
it's that guy

561
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:11,740
interviews I've just now working on a
documentary about

562
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,220
text adventures it's called get lamp:
get lamp: dot com

563
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,980
and yes those text adventures I'm
interviewing infocomm guys I'm into you

564
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,030
adventure guys

565
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,690
and after a number of efforts and going
through his daughter

566
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:29,100
I have interviewed the man who created
the choose your own adventure books

567
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,780
how persistence and saying I'm real fury
and here's what's going on

568
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,370
and it took three months but I got an
interview with them

569
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:41,110
and whether not that pans out to
something is something else but the

570
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,300
point is this I got it and some people
go

571
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,010
oh my god the guy who may choose your
own adventure books that's the guy

572
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,860
on you can't you know you can't ever act
like

573
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,030
up you know professional documentary
organized it a little bit different than

574
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,930
what we're talking about here

575
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:00,340
um I interviewed one fellow who had been
interviewed by another

576
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:03,910
on group I think it was either discovery
or something the producer doesn't even

577
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,770
come on

578
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,639
the shoe anymore the producer has a tap
at their office

579
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,990
with five screens and their schemes
traveling

580
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,060
around the area that are doing shoots
and she's

581
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,240
on phone and switching between them and
told them where to aim the camera would

582
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,370
set of questions to ask

583
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,440
so the teams are pretty much autonomous

584
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,190
headless cyborgs coming in to ask you
stupid ass

585
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,730
10 questions that they have listed in
going away from you you know I saw the

586
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,860
new york documentary in the head Donald
Trump in it

587
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,470
he says one thing skyscrapers are good

588
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:40,250
and I'm thinking its fuckin donald Trump
ask in 20 minutes a questions god damn

589
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,020
it will never see that footage

590
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,040
part of the reason part of the reason
why I am slowly uploading all 250 hours

591
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,200
of my interviews up

592
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,790
archive dork because I'd chose my five
and a half hours

593
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,110
this probably something in there for
other people on the other two hundred

594
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,170
hours

595
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:00,930
that they wanna see mom we are

596
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,210
um we got pretty chill owed we're almost
at I love

597
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,470
we're almost at the fifty minute mark so

598
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,720
bomb will just mention one other bit I
think

00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,890
putting his documentary up for you to
download

603
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:28,960
comment on it which is not the standard
operating procedure

604
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,410
yeah said basically the way have set it
up mines a donation based

605
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,790
model so that you can go out download
the movie if that's you like it

606
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,870
yes you know dunno you can donate a few
bucks

607
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,090
that's a donation models don't really a
make a lot of money

608
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,160
on as done this for

609
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,800
quite a while now and one thing you want
to do is if you do go donation is

610
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,420
maybe perhaps give people incentive to
donate so for instance

611
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,180
two months ago and as releasing version
.5 in foreign aid

612
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,750
the document you point it is work what
I'm on right now

613
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,020
I said you know what donate to me X
amount of dollars at the was 10 and you

614
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,950
get your name in the final credits

615
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:11,089
well the second after an issue dick
Slater I am

616
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:14,279
you know I've got all these people
donating to me ten dollars and %uh to

617
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,030
send more

618
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,169
which specifically fine and that's a
good way this makes

619
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,460
money but get it in your mind that
donation is

620
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,740
by love you know if your small lake

621
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,329
or me for underground I committees
donation is really

622
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:33,599
just for a record lows mind you you've
got different experiences

623
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,889
so i'm older I have a mortgage

624
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:42,319
%ah when I shot the film like I said I
shot the film assuming it would make no

625
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:42,989
money

626
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,220
this helped me a lot mama depending on
if you talk to my accountant

627
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,349
or me on my document request different
amounts of money

628
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:56,859
so let's go with on non on let's go with
non-recurring costs that is to say for

629
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:59,950
instance I wrote of my t1 line because
to my house

630
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:03,399
so I probably would have a t1 line
anyway

631
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,650
I didn't need that for the documentary
let's go with camera equipment

632
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,300
travel a editing I've had

633
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:14,040
6 terabytes hard drives I E

634
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,759
did editing software and other think so
if you look at that production cost the

635
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,220
film cost about twenty four twenty five
thousand dollars to make

636
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,259
I spent 27 bill thousand dollars on DVD
duplication

637
00:35:25,259 --> 00:35:31,029
and packaging so whatever that is I made
this act in about four weeks

638
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:34,220
after coming out

639
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:38,150
because it could trust me

640
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:41,839
of having said that it was also
available on the Pirate Bay within three

641
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,308
weeks

642
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:46,309
and also people were telling me you know
dude that's so unfair and I'm like its

643
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,109
Creative Commons

644
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:51,808
needed I get people who mail me from
schools and it depresses me I got the

645
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:54,019
Ontario school system actually there

646
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:57,190
acquisitions person milf means a me we
show this to

647
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,299
children or do we have to pay a fee

648
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:06,680
and I was like you can charge people to
see and raise money for your damn school

649
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,788
on you know unlike it out the bad words
because there's a few of them

650
00:36:10,789 --> 00:36:14,880
for some reason imagine that from me you
know it's like

651
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,890
I get people who there's some trade wars
in a dimensions as gainful trade words

652
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,499
with the trade wars fansite

653
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:24,249
cut out just the trade war spartan put
it up on their site

654
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:27,640
that's fine I wouldn't want fifty people
to buy it just for the trade wars part

655
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,470
they be pretty disappointed

656
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,299
slogging through the other four hours
looking for the 3-4 spark

657
00:36:33,299 --> 00:36:37,230
somebody uploaded four seconds ovett to
you too

658
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,910
because he's in it I of

659
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:44,710
you go BBS documents for you to get four
seconds at this dude

660
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:48,109
I actually interviewed people here and
everyone I interview to give them a free

661
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:48,670
copy

662
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,390
right that's how you do that and I had
pre orders which is part of why made

663
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,078
money

664
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:56,900
before you know so soon after it cuz I
said you know if you believe in me

665
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,730
and this was someone in anti-piracy
technique I said if you

666
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,769
okay wait wait wait wait wait fomented
fuckin language all the fuckin time

667
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:09,990
you can't it's really hard to part a
Creative Commons attribution-share alike

668
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,190
2.0

669
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:14,869
products you gotta rip my name of a
claim you did it

670
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:19,140
%ah you know and not let anyone have it
in all and sell the Sony

671
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:22,828
you gotta work really hard to kill the
fuckin license

672
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:26,529
okay so anyway so people that pay their
parroting I might know there really

673
00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:27,799
aren't

674
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:31,299
or also people who can't be pirated know
what gets up on her family

675
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:36,319
doesn't go I palm

676
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:40,230
actually there's like it's funny cuz I
got involved with the wares group that

677
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,630
pirated me

678
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,999
mom cuz I have the info printed up on
Mike

679
00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:48,289
wall and they basically pirated it

680
00:37:48,289 --> 00:37:50,950
where they put up the stuff and I was
like you don't get it's like you're

681
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,380
stealing the sugar packets at a
McDonald's

682
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,670
you know you're looking not it's not
really a weak dude

683
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:02,279
there's no protection on the thing right
costs money in ruins the desk

684
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:05,970
to put protection on it I could pay
fuckin Macrovision

685
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,569
like things like 35 cents a DVD for the
right

686
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:12,990
to make my DVD not work right

687
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,109
hi to fuck that noise um and I

688
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:19,089
made sure you know it's funny when you
shoot the stuff that this is the think

689
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:21,339
this is the important thing when you're
right at the end

690
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:24,339
as they say in the biz when you write to
the short strokes

691
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:28,839
you want to not betray what you thought
would you want to do when you got

692
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,259
beginning and by that I meant there's no
man you can't get out of

693
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:37,029
there's no logo you can't get out of
everything's got chapters

694
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:40,549
everything's got subtitles everything's
got commentary tracks

695
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:44,799
is like damnit I'm here I'm gonna you
know I spent four years on this bitch

696
00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:47,940
I'm gonna finish this thing right and
that's important you gotta finish off

697
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,619
what you're working on it and stay true
to what your believing in

698
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,369
that was an interesting rant sorry about
that I got all jello inspired here

699
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:58,099
I om nom don't use that microphone

708

718
00:39:59,309 --> 00:40:03,210
a game in a month back miserable towards
I wonder what those are

719
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:06,710
at piracy I wonder what that is are you
a pirate

720
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,360
are you injure

721
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,800
so you know you you you can't discount
that almost to my promotion

722
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,960
is through online I have a documentary

723
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,470
Tom what was that I can't even read that
that means stop talking

724
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:27,100
10 minutes 10 minutes what's you go
ahead and talk for a while modem of

725
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,190
okay well it's a wanted to get two years
is that you can never go to big

726
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:34,740
so a lot of people and a lot of
corporations especially because this is

727
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,120
an expertise you at this

728
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,640
am they think that because they don't
have used their phone number

729
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,270
out there that you won't get in touch
with them and that if you do so happy to

730
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:44,670
get in touch with them than you

731
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:48,610
must be someone is legit so 411 is your
friend

732
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:52,520
and you go to website lets the or some
organization

733
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,520
that states there that rhymes with the
nine-percent

734
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,830
and you go said the other into the city
don't have contact info but they have

735
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:01,560
their address

736
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,000
well you basically a but that in 411

737
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,690
reverse lookup and those are fun you
call a month and is there direct line

738
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:10,910
that helps

739
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,410
google is also your friend rate the rahh

740
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,379
has no numbers on their website you go
to Google do a quick search

741
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,900
and bank first result RIAA you call it
up and within 10 seconds of calling up

742
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,470
the first number that came up

743
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,710
on that search it was on a form
somewhere someone at the work

744
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:32,210
for me sorry running outta there and you
go there you call them up then before

745
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:36,080
you know it you're in contact with the
media relations person at

746
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:40,680
what I said reff so you got goat fuckers
incorporated i think is their American

747
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,180
names

748
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,899
goat fuckers in corporate limited is a
good fuckers limited

749
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,280
sorry KK comment rate of

750
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,980
but says so yeah it's you can never go
to big in a lot of people are gonna say

751
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,620
yes it is going to surprise you

752
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,839
and they individuals are a lot more
easier they care

753
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,560
you know I'd to call the Sun kansai
corporations and then I

754
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,740
email for example Michael guest and he's
a oh yes sir

755
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,860
also rate and

756
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:10,310
another thing that I forgot to say that
you should always do that

757
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,240
email tends not to work so it's you for
corporations at least they'll

758
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,420
it's gone but he column then they
actually

759
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,250
you get someone and that's what it
pushes in a bit to actually get it back

760
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:21,950
in touch with you

761
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,220
he have to call call I don't know if you
can hear this on the mic but

762
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,260
call again as a there the Z for the most
part

763
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:33,210
or they're extremely busy after further
think they're lazy and EDL

764
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,280
get back to you if you're you're
annoying enough to them

765
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,580
so it definitely call emails bad

766
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:43,610
that's pretty much all I can think up
when it comes to contacting large

767
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,550
corporations

768
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:49,220
CON using persistence dedication and
strength what should come as a great

769
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,260
shock to people

770
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:54,960
yes most def 2000 and make yourself some
professional to rate she say like this

771
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,520
yeah I'm like you're doing a documentary
on like

772
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,780
a a and that's the phone call you
someone in trouble

773
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:05,580
but what I did for instance is for my
cell phone right I i change

774
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,640
my voice box thing sensors Inc in this
is John McArdle II

775
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:14,470
I started saying hints else's studios to
make myself or professional and again

776
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,390
it's a great surprise when they see you
walking

777
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,960
this 20-year-old walking to the room the
lake the fuck are you but hey

778
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,700
it helps in it it's all for the image
some professional sound like they want

779
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,720
you to be interested

780
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,280
and also be the best friend and you have
to really

781
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,390
especially with corporations you have to
some would be %uh the same perspective

782
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,109
as there and that's not to say that

783
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,440
I've a different perspective than anyone
I interviewed

784
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,670
but you have to be

785
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,910
real nice and suck up a lot being
competitive

786
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:47,750
is not you know I I really can't watch
the last 10 minutes

787
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,130
%uh Bowling for Columbine anymore
because all it is

788
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:54,200
is a com it's just its its a

789
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,150
bomb rush you know it's basically where
you had 10 questions that you want to

790
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,030
hit on somebody

791
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:03,410
the guy lets you into his fuckin house
and you fuckin

792
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:06,600
bomb Russia with five questions I
understand why this was done I

793
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,070
understand how it's compelling

794
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,400
but I can't watch it anymore dissident
thing on that or what

795
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,520
well as if we start talking about
bowling for Columbine will

796
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,980
jello everybody let's not do that no no
I didn't mean I meant on them rushing

797
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,460
people

798
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,590
Obama rushing ass how much you need to
do that

799
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,570
issuer contacts on it let's you can ask
people

800
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,100
very difficult questions without waiting
at us such

801
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:33,300
because people are smart and if you were
questions intelligently

802
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,790
will be willing to answer even if
they're really really tough questions

803
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:41,070
so you don't have to go the whole bum
rush that's only if she won

804
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,240
to go for that kind of attitude but you
were fully free to ask

805
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,650
attack star questions to people if you
were them in a nice

806
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,870
and its intelligent matter and you'll
get the same reply

807
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,910
minus the deer in headlights response
that you know are you a jeep

808
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,200
cock sucking bitch and other like what
well it was better to do you ask

809
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,800
are you a homosexual that some you know
your there's a

810
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,630
well there's a that's a bad eggs is a
film okay here's

811
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,850
if if yeah if you want a good example is
one called is that there's a film out

812
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:13,009
there which is horrible called the God
who wasn't there

813
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,990
um its I got it from my atheist friend
we sat down with it hoping that we're

814
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,290
gonna kick gotten enough for forty-five
minutes

815
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,440
but it turned out that would have mostly
was was I had a really bad

816
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,190
time in parochial school so we went back
and got

817
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:30,630
an interview with his principal and he
starts hitting them up with obscure

818
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,140
biblical questions in quandaries

819
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:37,029
and his principles like might in his
principal is literally appealing to him

820
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,990
like Michael you didn't tell me this is
what we're gonna talk about

821
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:44,110
not oh my god the hidden story I've got
the Droid

822
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,220
Michael what the fuck I

823
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,580
I mean look you know I don't think we're
gonna keep this interview peak includes

824
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:51,970
all this is why I know this right

825
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:55,990
01 and it's like you showed the menu ask
also

826
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:59,000
there's different ways you could tell a
story and and you know

827
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,940
it's a really bad sign when people don't
like the filmmaker at the end of it

828
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:08,360
you've not done your job or at least at
the very least maybe you've done the job

829
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:11,540
as well as you're capable of doing and
you need to realize that this maybe

830
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,060
shouldn't be your job

831
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:16,360
um a downer to go of all its going
something

832
