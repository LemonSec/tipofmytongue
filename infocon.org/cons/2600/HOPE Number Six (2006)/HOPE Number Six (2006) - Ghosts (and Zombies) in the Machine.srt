1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,879
and I'm have no idea why and if you
aren't in the social engineering panel

2
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:04,660
because France

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:11,660
always extremely entertaining but your

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,270
yeah okay good

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,500
got rid of one person so at

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,950
this will be a somewhat visitors to the
someone said really entertaining things

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,669
to look at

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,430
in this topic but I'm the only person in
the room was going to get to see them

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,039
cell and skin like start my slideshow

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,130
and I thank you I'm my you know I asked
the wrong person if it was everything

11
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,800
was all set

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,250
the person you should always ask for a
TV people effing

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,530
have the commitment to stir some random
guy with the number two badge

14
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm book

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,079
your now would be a little too much um

16
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:56,350
so the basic topic here is Ghosn zombies
in the machine which is just a

17
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,579
kinda completely random collection just
things that I find a little interesting

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,069
strange but the internet I'm

19
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,959
the this kind of two topics that the

20
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,869
now be focusing on to topic said are I
found kinda fascinating that have

21
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,969
definitely kinda flourished in last few
years

22
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,579
the first one is II

23
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:24,029
there's no real kind of official term
apart you can

24
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,590
column Wed Kooser zombie pages or
whatever

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,099
and it's just the I'm existence if

26
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:36,499
all the you know you've got what there's
hundreds and millions of blogs now and

27
00:01:36,499 --> 00:01:37,229
there's like

28
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,219
92 exactly although all the pages

29
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,409
and web sites mean sure there's all the
kind of like you know there's the Canada

30
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:47,849
infinite crafted the

31
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:51,450
internet in the web where to in there
said banded web sites

32
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,569
mad make you know he's going to slowly
fade away your

33
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,130
just heard existing on the Internet
Archive and stuff but one more

34
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,219
interesting is all these

35
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:03,659
personal blogs and profiles have all
these people

36
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,369
and then the people died and the pages
don't

37
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,120
and its like this is something that I
came on

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,160
to originally when when my friends

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,190
and up in Boston gon who is

40
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:23,190
who 0 of course

41
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,000
this is like a cool down before it's not
I don't think it's the iBook one now

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,550
hmm the act but it's a few notes nice in
white

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,290
show you know has to have to

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,109
completely you know proprietary little
time

45
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:45,110
FM I'm sure it's somebody here could do
it well the only promises the wireless

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,460
doesn't work here soon

47
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,050
you have will mean you have to plug in
the computer to

48
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,900
were on standby power find the where

49
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,900
in money things and new

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,600
we could do that I'm

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,500
so either way and yeah okay we can I
come up in

52
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,050
we can You Can Am John the presentation
as well I'm

53
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,580
so I think we should give him a roundup
on throughout we see around prize and

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,250
then we'll find out if this actually
works

55
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,630
so

56
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:32,630
what's the actual the I would recommend

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,010
that strong you

58
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,649
okay so we're gonna make a little nice
little package and stick it on a fast

59
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,650
track

60
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,470
so that's one topic and then another one
is which is really completely unrelated

61
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,580
except that you could

62
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,280
call it's you know other than the zombie
concept is have

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,600
come from zombie army news and we will
be blue

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,859
which are just like I you know on the
botnets and

65
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,990
I'm sure there are people here who know
considerably more about it than me

66
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,080
who were here by now I don't think
enemies

67
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,198
really giving a talk about them so you
know I get to be the person doing

68
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,520
for

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,889
om and

70
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:45,889
the in

71
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,240
and those are again Mike Barnett said
you seen

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,850
X you know kind extraordinary growth in

73
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,020
last seen a few years and there's can
have

74
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,370
some really interesting stuff going on
with that in Trenton

75
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,500
you know complete multi task here

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,500

78
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,850
we can

79
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,850
kinda fake I guess so here

80
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,960
really we got that so arm

81
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,150
well and of will be able to show you
these pictures and you can catch up but

82
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,509
I'm so this is my friend Mike I the

83
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,310
Chris Malone to use the super cool check

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,719
I'm 223 said and I

89
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:26,099

com was reading her bike without a
helmet not hit by a car and died

91
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,090

weird thing is is that her friend sir

93
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:39,680
and now so now says that she's 31

94
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,400
you know but does no because two years
have passed by

95
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,639
we wanted big differences between and
Friendster and MySpace

96
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,240
other than the fact that their about

97
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,050
94 million people on MySpace now you
know some

98
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,199
be number approximating that we like in
2005

99
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,289
he was at seventeen million so mean the

100
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,509
the growth rate there is a little
extreme I'm

101
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:08,810
is that also on profiles on MySpace

102
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,839
Mike its it the default settings that
people can just continue reading

103
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,909
comments in Iran might be posted soon

104
00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:18,409
after you die year your page becomes
like this

105
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:22,139
you know happy tributes flash people
getting to write mean things about you

106
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:22,810
when you're dead

107
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:27,960
I'm and its is really interesting
because like you know the whole space

108
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,810
love how we deal with death and all
these things he's always been for you

109
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,250
know extremely well

110
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,740
om Union modulated by tradition and
culture in convention

111
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,810
you know it's you go to funeral singers
longer the deliberate ceremony and

112
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,830
in in you know in a bitch worries are
written by the same

113
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:49,199
you know old crusty guys in the
newspapers and they have a very specific

114
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,460
form about what

115
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,550
you know what is it that goes into an
obituary Mike

116
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,370
if you die an interesting way you get
the story about my

117
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,919
you know you get hit you were hit by a
car that fell off a truck

118
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,279
word you were eaten by an alligator for
you

119
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:08,250
you know hit by a car while you're
riding your bike for you

120
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,520
of you know where some guy few with
nineteen-years-old in

121
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,919
weaved in New Bedford and you hi after
you like assaulted and killed some

122
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,818
people in a gay bar you got it

123
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:21,979
hi killed in a a shootout in Kansas

124
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,389
on Mike you know with the cops

125
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:29,020
but the whole point is is that you know
that's kind of where the the story would

126
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,389
and then there might be no

127
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:33,500
a little bit chewy re that would you
know no dead

128
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,958
you know they door survived by their
their mother or whatever

129
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,560
your cat come but the difference is now
you get to go on their pages and you

130
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,810
see that these people you know were well
like the

131
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:48,690
the guy who me Jacob roba

132
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,110
was the one who now did a

133
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,160
became a nurse staffing in a New Bedford
about

134
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,790
scrimmages exactly a year ago and

135
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,079
he had you know really appropriate an

136
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:09,130
MySpace page for someone who do that
news big Insane Clown Posse fan

137
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:14,050
mom an unfortunate myspace took it down
but unlike some people have archived it

138
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,620
and then there's

139
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,420
been it's a factual if we take a step
back

140
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,219
from the stories and we think about is
kinda statistics

141
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,399
so there's like about you know
approximately 100 million people on

142
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,290
MySpace

143
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,709
and you know they're mostly in their
kinda 15:02

144
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:36,890
you know forty marine even less but
we've seen on the 15 24 25 to 44 each

145
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:37,399
group

146
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,350
down were talkin so for every hundred
thousand people

147
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,510
better you know between the ages 15-24

148
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,410
I'm about ninety at them die per year

149
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,620
common sense like 29 cars 18 you know
homicides

150
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,569
12 suicides and then for like the 25 to
44 you get more

151
00:09:58,569 --> 00:10:01,949
you get more aids and cancer and heart
attacks om

152
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:05,579
this suicide rate actually is higher
when you're

153
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:08,829
border about over 25 which is
contrasting

154
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,439
but the homicide rate is lower maybe
because you're

155
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:15,660
dying of cancer instead or something I'm
but

156
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,189

more interesting pages

175
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,880
I am and there's actually right now
there's one guy who's

180
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,069
I love them and he has this huge backlog
like have people submitting

181
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:54,890
the pages and thank you you need

182
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,020
cock hook them up to acting in an
official bitch wary

183
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,550
and links to the profile and can and
does it without comment and then there's

184
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,579
like a form into

185
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,390
some people like haha this is for you
know this guy was such a fucking retard

186
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,970
I mean you know in like when you kill
yourself by climbing into a helium

187
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,300
balloon

188
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,510
Mike you know you shouldn't do things
like that

189
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,890
wake baby at least day the people who
did that

190
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,120
there was a and I this outgrown a guy
down enough or if they did it together

191
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,470
cell I mean you know I think you know if
you can make yourself known

192
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,620
dumb way you should do it with someone
else because you know

193
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,959
you know the number you like out you
know at least

194
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:39,550
someone outside with system

195
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,050
rain exactly I mean like you know be you
know in a it's with kinda fun things is

196
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,939
that it's

197
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:48,010
you you could think if this is I'm
making people talk more frankly about

198
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,709
suicide in about the dangers of like the
choking game

199
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:56,640
which is you know where I guess you I'm
hang yourself until you start choking

200
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,130
and then

201
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,490
if you you know we hope we don't die
time

202
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,699
but sometimes you do and then you get

203
00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:08,089
and people get to look at your myspace
profile

204
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:12,589
I'm and the

205
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:15,929
well and then I can find info on what I
would do his own

206
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,170
kinda fast forward to the next topic

207
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,929
and we meaning yeah if you see stars
working

208
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,010
who that's looking like your screen

209
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,679
that sweet we can take a look at
summaries profile pages

210
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,420
0 and there's one that is really spooky
the girl got you by an alligator

211
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,910

into your blog how she'd woken up

I'm film

223
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,990
sweeping you can

224
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,419
going

225
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:34,419
our I'm

226
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:40,339
game makers you know I unika

227
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,610
now there's not really any excuse Penn

228
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,140
with from my computer

229
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,900
I'm fee no that's right that's what I
wanted to make a

230
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,319
II and the PowerPoint inward

231
00:14:56,319 --> 00:14:59,970
because it's a macro PowerPoint file
your

232
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:04,179
the okay so well this is just a with
Cisco to the web and we can look at them

233
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:10,669
myspace zombie pages

234
00:15:10,669 --> 00:15:14,860
be we're who track to do that

235
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,439
and may who was fifth woo

236
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:22,610
month I'm

237
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,189
soon

238
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:30,209
well it's probably different now like
you might have in order

239
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:33,289
version implication which case

240
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:36,519
I mean I could if I'd saved to thing

241
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,629
on but

242
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:46,629
the

243
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:54,700
I'm

244
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,620
if you actually from Nepal ko web page
we can

245
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,910
once a week in this time Brunswickers

246
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,910
do some stuff

247
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,650
summer

248
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:19,310
okay and the connection time to answer
networks

249
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,470
kind of hammered I think

250
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,490
arm so the other topic

251
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,600
that guys been looking at is

252
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,870
can have zombie networks the

253
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:37,740
whatever's on the Army's by nets and

254
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,420
thats you know him really all it is is
it's

255
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,860
and I can if hi illegal in on

256
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,900
hmm intentional distributed computing or
it's completely intentional on the part

257
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,390
of the people who are taking over the
computers

258
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,420
but the you know

259
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,870
the people who computers they are
generally don't know

260
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,860
that like their their cycles are being
used for

261
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,640
either you know illegal gain in profit
I'm

262
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,130
in its kinda been if you look at canada
buy the comparison

263
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,660
%ah like the biggest

264
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,980
widget in man distributed computing

265
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,089
project is study at home and

266
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,879
like it Scott about 5.2 million
participants

267
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,400
and so that's what work fast unit
performed

268
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,710
has performed on September 2000 26 2001

269
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:38,740
form a total 1,021 floating point
operations is acknowledged by the

270
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,680
Guinness World Records as large as
competition history

271
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,780
with over 900,000 to his 5.2 million
participants but

272
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,610
900,000 computers in the system an exit
or you can get over 250 teraflops

273
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,660
nance I can serve April 2006 where he
said blue jean

274
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,920
like the supercomputer nets at 200 PD

275
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,970
so that's you know senate like that's
pretty

276
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,830
pretty badass of course hi you know

277
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,060
the funny thing is is that the like them

278
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,990
the the botnet are on the same scale

279
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,090
as as these projects like and there's

280
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,320
what more well an author's want more by
what's

281
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,360
you know kind of work which assume that
they're there probably are

282
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,900
I there was one I'm

283
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,170
relatively recent case where

284
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,360
in the Netherlands where this I'm

285
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,410
guy who's like a nice these three people
I'm

286
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,220
when 1922 in 27 were arrested

287
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,590
for network that you know their prefer
said was like

288
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,149
a hundred thousand and and they said it
was like 1.5 million

289
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,450
but noted some kind of completely fuzzy
unknown very large number because

290
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,760
seminar thing is is that

291
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,300
the computers just keep on getting
infected infected arm

292
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,540
beyond the he was the the Houston the
TOC spot

293
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,290
Trojan which the install the Nissan

294
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,879
adware and spyware and the

295
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,070
on did ninety denial of service attack
on this US company

296
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,689
I'm T in extortion attempt because they
were like we're gonna

297
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,620
we're gonna take your website down if
you don't you know don't pass out in

298
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,210
in pairs happen and I you know to find
one time I am

299
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,950
but gonna get arrested so shipped

300
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,010
and they also like fish

301
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,110
Pay Pal account YouTube a.m. like you
know I'm

302
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:37,190
I'm not sure you I was able to see %uh
find out what what

303
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,570
cool stuff made by but you know it's

304
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,889
is when those things that about half the
time

305
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,230
the these are like there's a day

306
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,500
i mean you know if prongs like from you
know most criminals only

307
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,150
you know think really a flick you not be
big enough like

308
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,780
if you can do this if you know how to do
this like you

309
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,590
you know it so me a small flip to figure
I had him

310
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,110
make millions dollars like you know
legally

311
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,870
um you know and if it's kind of like the
West enough

312
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,160
you know governments in on the other
hand like

313
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,790
see mean you know working for the NSA is
what

314
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,970
high school so I mean like

315
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,570
what talks by did is that it's you know
it will all these things do is that they

316
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,950
just use kind of

317
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,030
known when does exploits on

318
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,260
Mike this one uses American a sequel
server

319
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,020
privilege s escalation deal well buffer
overflow and I i

320
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,150
just they just use known patched

321
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:45,240
Windows on Boehner

322
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,520
abilities %ah goin' Mike

323
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,650
he saw themselves and open on back door

324
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,850
on I and Jim basically

325
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,390
to start contacting

326
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:02,520
IRC various IRC channels

327
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,940
on Micon on different network said

328
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:10,080
and different you know ok servers that
have generally

329
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,340
can be I'm using names Micah

330
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,990
missing Mike you know on martian song
dot com and

331
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,810
my secure name dot com things like going
for Mars dot com

332
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,610
you know it's likely website and

333
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:33,250
the time

334
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,850
and and you know in in in the venue just
launch

335
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,390
I various attacks in there pretty much
mean is always

336
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,929
some profit motive some 100 on with what
I've

337
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,150
with a lot of stuff I am and

338
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,730
do you mean like I've kinda been in with
there's a growth in

339
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,210
the I'm hey say

340
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,480
McKenna for are organized crime doing
things

341
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,480
in mafia send it to you want to be a
pretty much

342
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,050
you know it's definitely majorities
overs overseas surgeon is found as

343
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:09,050
outside the United States om

344
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,810
and the Mikey you know another variation

345
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,030
ways is our like another group was MOOC

346
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,230
now like MW Tim 20 P

347
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:25,280
which is like a behind the lawn was a
63-year-old inning when a 28-year-old in

348
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,670
Scotland next year old in Finland

349
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,420
om and the wrote now recuse

350
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,240
Trojan which was actually based on the
Sony rootkit said

351
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,640
making a and in like in the Union

352
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,540
got like a fifty thousand computer
botnet

353
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,790
com and Suzi chin units on each

354
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,620
and I i think you have to give them
props for basically

355
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,240
creating the mean because

356
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,230
there's actually relatively widow and
investment in

357
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,370
at creating new

358
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,400
new malware new the the new software
most the time

359
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,060
it's just people taking the code in

360
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,620
tweaking a thing or two and Sue sony did
a really good job

361
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,450
you know paying cokie campaign companies
to do the real innovation

362
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,150
to find new attacks and of course no the
reality is that company

363
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:25,170
be you comp store Batcave stop their own
state

364
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,250
there are only two but the United a the
I really do think you should give Sony

365
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:29,890
credit

366
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,800
for advancing the botnet field

367
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm and in getting away with it which is
pretty cool

368
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,380
10 agassi they had to give away some CDs

369
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,010
on which and I think they were like
Kelly Clarkson sound mean

370
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,070
you know who wins really ir

371
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,439
the and you know when they were just
doing it to your liking

372
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,250
d generate spam quick threes and minutes
is this whole thing this is like

373
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,770
if you've gone a hundred thousand
computers a control

374
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,580
your you can do the things that only you
know generate a few thousand bucks a

375
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,100
month

376
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,610
and you know it's it's pretty cool I'm

377
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,460
speaking you know you're a kid like cure
cancer with the

378
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,100
and he would do its in mint stuff arm
but it's you know it's

379
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,050
its not generally huge money except for
the time

380
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,129
but they can also do this is they do one
key walking

381
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,600
a huge fishing for like credit cards

382
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,340
and stuff i mean so he needs to am sure
Steve Graham BAM had been arrested he

383
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,790
would have been talking about how

384
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,340
like you know everybody has all view
credit cards

385
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,699
um were not necessarily the people in
this room before

386
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,990
because we're smart in WI we use

387
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,679
on proper security protocols om by

388
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,280
you know in a general sense Mike tears

389
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
you know I if it's being used to be

390
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,990
you know if you've if you've ever
interacted with anything with a Windows

391
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,280
machine

392
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,389
you know electronically you know you can
assume that

393
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,510
you know there's no real reason at that
date is

394
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,179
close down I'm the

395
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,710
group that I've gotten along so I one is
give some credit here something I wanted

396
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,919
this information has been coming from

397
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,280
shadow server which is in

398
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,379
volunteer organization that pretty much

399
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,169
II does all the things to try to you can
have track

400
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:34,640
and you have the tools to take down
views

401
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,179
on patents the Brian

402
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:41,460
on based set up and run honeypots

403
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,659
were day you know create

404
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:50,250
just aggressively open computers that
are just thinks he's in fact me

405
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,630
and then they you fat to track people

406
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,300
they also regular weekday also
investigate the software themselves

407
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,429
so the you know when they get good the
new I'm

408
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:04,450
when they get infected they go through
in like that

409
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,330
you know in our separate from what the
antivirus companies are doing

410
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:11,600
I am they also track

411
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,929
v these botnets which is 10 km most
interesting things and so

412
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,330
and they create a list I

413
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,158
running west various kinda pic
command-and-control centers

414
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,800
cell all these by Nazi have there's

415
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,510
some IP address that all these computers
are

416
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:35,419
Mike being controlled by and

417
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:40,320
doing and so it's the in like you so
wanted the kind of

418
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,970
v %um things that you can do you

419
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,320
and as their as a civilian if you are

420
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,820
don't want you know if you want to
protect in kind

421
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,889
fight the things is in the same way is
that they have in well actually these

422
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:55,570
are

423
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,178
not these are often a strong overlap

424
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:02,570
we age arm the with spanner

425
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,908
networks in other words these you know
you have your gonna black out miss

426
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:11,270
open relay servers I E they're also
these black

427
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,879
the source shadow server must create a
black out west

428
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,890
combat net control centers and you know
some users can if it's you're not going

429
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,520
to win

430
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,658
the game by blocking out the sites but
its

431
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,620
it's something that I'm you know he
gives you you something

432
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,020
of in age and

433
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,270
then they also worked with

434
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:39,080
the private companies and with law
enforcement to try

435
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,490
to you on track and then only and that's
it wanted in with that

436
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,530
kind there other mean group

437
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,820
use I'm tracking

438
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,928
the information that gets captured so

439
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:55,130
Mike whether or not some credit card

440
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,800
number has been compromised but what do
what these with the credit cards and

441
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,429
passwords and accounts

442
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:04,429
are that being compromised so they're a
definitely a very

443
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,419
kinda interesting grey hat group am your
white house

444
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:11,659
dead has farted no bad information

445
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:16,290
some whitehead's they're not bad people

446
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,649
home and actually the do they've works

447
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:22,919
baby the people

448
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,060
now have worked the best with them
everything's like the secret service

449
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,690
actually care a lot because the secret
service handles

450
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,440
Madonna Mike

451
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,630
federal monetary transfer stuff

452
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,909
banking fraud and v

453
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,840
in so they've kinda found that if we
look at the botnet statistics

454
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,960
about half of them on are just

455
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,500
onto now service-related kinda like so
the dumbest

456
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,590
I think he just a button a doozy 27 all
hammer

457
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:58,560
some sites simultaneously I'm about 30
percent in them

458
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,928
I do you do like adware spam

459
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:06,659
Mike so they'll step install adware no
send out spam

460
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:10,270
home in about 20 percent are just die
doing

461
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,270
Mike spreading Justin involved in Mike's

462
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:16,750
I'm growing themselves i doing
keylogging

463
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,360
and you and unless it goes Nana those
classifications are necessarily

464
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,860
exclusive

465
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,950
hot summer the things that they found
her the

466
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,610
how by netzer evolving you know so to
speak is this is that there's

467
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,669
you know and im someone to see the guy I
was talking to is

468
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:38,500
thing that you do not users is not
fundamentally interesting I mean it's

469
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,960
like its kinda the same PC software
being run by people

470
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,300
who want you know they're not doing it
to create are 24 Union

471
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,350
dude just infecting computers and then

472
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,210
Mike typing day the commands in their
little liar see

473
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,070
channel to have them you know going do
something

474
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:59,370
and so it's you know it's kinda code
monkey stuff but

475
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,850
v so the innovations are basically in
avoiding getting caught

476
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,690
Tom and doing things like running the
command control centers like from your

477
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,790
PDA

478
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,530
com more you know to accuse hang out at
a coffee shop in

479
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,070
and doing things like that arm and
there's also

480
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,740
more use it encryption I they're
starting to move away from

481
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:24,679
now I to susan RC their multi-server

482
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,350
I'm scene sees since the command in
control

483
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,520
and so that's one those are the types of
things that they're

484
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,899
on a their tracking and you know in
seeing

485
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:39,300
I'm and then so working you do

486
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:43,520
hands to kinda avoid

487
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,940
getting you know becoming a zombie so

488
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:51,000
II which is don't let people use your
brains

489
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,330
through number Mike if they don't have
the earrings is have to bite you

490
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,960
right second standards on beefing

491
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,790
rain rain you well so don't do that now
and stone

492
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,320
do anything said Mike was it like mister
scheck exercises

493
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,620
helps I think so but for your computer's

494
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,110
it's the it mean in some satellite it's
just the basic thing just keep up with

495
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,330
the patches

496
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,699
II you have your anti-virus software to
Phnom Penh strange email

497
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,810
consider a you know that they can have
the basic things that

498
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:27,810
like if everybody did it would be a lot
better

499
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,149
arm now secondly I

500
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:35,230
using and an Internet detection system
likes nor

501
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:38,550
time you know is is a very good idea and

502
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,710
those would also like there was some

503
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:45,169
those that software will often include

504
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,649
kinda like the botnet rule sets michael
is a botnet set some compiled by

505
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:53,940
group on Channel server and they also
have kind of like them

506
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,000
botnet signatures I've you know

507
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,179
the if the network com things

508
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:03,590
and so like it you when you get up to
your system and stuff

509
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,050
or even I mean your personal computer
like a on a

510
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,800
personal network runner corporate one
you wanna have

511
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,919
proper firewall configuration I'm in you

512
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,419
in egress filtering is I mean if you you
know it's like if you wanna

513
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:22,690
walk down I your network

514
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,010
is is that you just do it so like you
say even if I'm getting even if I get

515
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:26,919
infected

516
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:30,669
Mike computer I'm not gonna let my
computer contact

517
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:33,960
the the commands Center on

518
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,659
si se Mike you know you started to use
you know is if you block IRC connections

519
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:45,480
Mike fee your computer can be controlled
through IRC connections even if it or if

520
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,220
it has to suffer even if it's been
Trojans

521
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,659
com and so if you control and the

522
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:54,990
outgoing connections from a computer yet
from your computer's

523
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,140
you will that's when it kinda the
primary thanks

524
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,390
and then it's also the classic things I
are dead you know change your passwords

525
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,530
yousef don't use the same password for
everything because that's what won the

526
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,480
big things that these

527
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,899
on people do it so describe the
passwords and

528
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,100
you know on something that's relatively
in securing enough to start plugging it

529
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,200
into your day

530
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,370
in paper how and ever in whenever immune

531
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,020
been you like and life is creepy

532
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,190
on offense for right am cliche name

533
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,920
but I do I create the um and you should
do

534
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,679
things like do deep scanning I mean an
hour's like

535
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,110
on do more I mean do a kind about

536
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,610
48 like you know dueled do tried it
before review

537
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,710
iraq's and really pay attention to you

538
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,870
they can if unusual traffic I'm

539
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:49,940
so can't know what you expected network
traffic is

540
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,380
and when you see something that he use
strange its

541
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,450
you know probably something that's you
don't like

542
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,110
I love course there's also the whole
thing if you

543
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,160
om avoid windows you're gonna be

544
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,980
marketer of I but that's not to say that

545
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,799
bike you can have apartments that are
being run on my clinics in vaccines

546
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,100
because

547
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,179
um even if I'm the

548
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,330
their operating system doesn't have
basically

549
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,790
and he X you know exploitable

550
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,668
you know on our ability to serve on a
reset happen exported

551
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:30,190
if you're running say had you know

552
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:33,530
your PHP bulletin board system II

553
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,470
like you then if there's any in in this
is I'm not speaking entirely

554
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,990
hypothetically

555
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:43,879
and there was this I'm PHP now I've own
ability that was exploited and so there

556
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:45,069
was this network does

557
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:48,279
I'm using Mike the

558
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,679
Unix and and and no están

559
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,470
computers in running on them and so
that's

560
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:58,819
it is like

561
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:02,440
you know if you can basically be smug
about it like if you're

562
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,260
you know if you don't use Windows calm
but

563
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,510
you you know at some but that doesn't
mean that you won't actually ever

564
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,170
I'm get infected arm and so

565
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,280
kinda shadow servers here's a little

566
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,819
kind description unkind self description
from them so its shadow server .org

567
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:26,650
I am there they're kinda admiring
channel on IRC

568
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,240
and they're on freenode and it's on
shadow server not work is the channel

569
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,770
om and the couple

570
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:39,690
botnet in malware research with
gathering of intelligence sharing and

571
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,290
feed it won't be an open source
community

572
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:46,410
in building reports and data-driven
block with us we do work directly with

573
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,149
law enforcement in that gives us

574
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,069
another unique angle our team members
are from all over the world most are

575
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,290
us-based

576
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,859
but they have a good presence in Europe
and Australia so it's

577
00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,140
United week I'm and their

578
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,680
internetworld I'll its this is where

579
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,350
I I think my my friendlier

580
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,960
am you know computer cover escaped

581
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,200
so now I if

582
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,960
at Chateau server they have 9 you it's a
it's easy it's a fun site to deceive and

583
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,690
kinda poke around on because

584
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,730
they have to wear civis the botnets
their tracking

585
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,920
om and I the

586
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,580
they have with the tickets and each one
has like

587
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:34,970
mike in need what've

588
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,859
them dispersed the there with the
specific now where was

589
00:36:38,859 --> 00:36:42,520
that arm that originates a botnet

590
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,740
and so they picked it up either into
what they do is they clinton when they

591
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,660
first it

592
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,259
find botnets usually through another
botnet when one other hi honey pots

593
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,470
or if it orphan Makino arm

594
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,850
to skydive I tries to infect them hmmm

595
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:01,160
you know where they gonna get you know
as they get an email with it and so what

596
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,910
they do is they

597
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:05,310
md5 hash now where I'm classifier

598
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,460
according its function put that up on
the ticket they've so they put the hash

599
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:12,790
up this offer I am and the

600
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,040
take the in this is kinda fun things is
they

601
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,480
put up the the CNC dialogue that takes
place on their kinda IRC channel that's

602
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,400
using it

603
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,859
arm and it so like you know for example

604
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:29,279
like one ticket you think I R C barnett
looks like an ordinary nun

605
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,010
IRC chat session except that it's like
the they're not you know kind talking in

606
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:33,940
people with

607
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,940
it's more like looking at you know where
a file-sharing

608
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,839
IRC connection

609
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:46,259
and think they have something like their
topic for dinner 666 channel

610
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,299
like you know because that's kinda great
thing about these issues said

611
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:52,589
consider are in honour it's all edgy

612
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:57,150
arm and hatchery haxor

613
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,680
thank 666 is my computer is my channel
man so

614
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,640
like the command would be like scan
sixty 1.1 Gottex Gottex

615
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,549
om an I'm what it does is a big

616
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:11,990
it and in that sense that command out to
all the P on the computer in the botnet

617
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,460
to start scanning

618
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:17,640
on the United star port scanning I sixty
1.1

619
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,839
arm and then once enough machines are
found

620
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,950
the now where is downloaded to the
victim machine and

621
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:29,049
you know executors accused for execution
upon the Next Food

622
00:38:29,049 --> 00:38:32,359
Combat Machine is now part a botnet

623
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:35,990
and the same channel commands will work

624
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:40,120
and so its kinda a he that is when the
fun things this is that you really do

625
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,940
get this

626
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:46,680
home you know the the Nets came into use
my software

627
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,759
knees the sanction they work well om

628
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,100
and you know and that's kinda what they
do but

629
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,130
see 26.0 we go

630
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,810
so that's in many ways live kinda for
the prepared text i half

631
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,450
there be more and foreign rice at it
they are pretty pictures

632
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:11,470
because you know it's especially of all
the

633
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,580
the MySpace pages because you know me

634
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,900
you know it's sad when the nice people
die and there are some people that you

635
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,049
can tell

636
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:23,210
why beaded home

637
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:27,390
well I mean you know Mike Keefe you

638
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,569
I mean there is the your like the

639
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:34,009
like you know I feared if you act like
you're

640
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,810
kinda meh psychotic racist

641
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:41,410
crazy dude who really likes guy and you
know it has like

642
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,839
use my picture my myspace profound he's
my guy in

643
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:50,339
and I'm Lake he you know Lake you know
and I hate gays and using the

644
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,080
you know you can you actually can you
can can predict that

645
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,200
I am so I

646
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,069
well material 10 who were you the 50
minutes before the hour so if anybody

647
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:03,690
has any questions or comments

648
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,799
I don't know if anybody in the eye.
audience has experience with that

649
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:10,990
but nets I'm under this is a a great
time

650
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,910
to come up and their and your

651
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,220
your two cents film beacon

652
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,270
you come up to my career to

653
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,720
chat I this on

654
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,799
yep I have a 9 experience this early
with them

655
00:40:28,799 --> 00:40:33,450
but thats but I have a question and
combining the idea of

656
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,910
dead P that people's pages on MySpace
and botnets

657
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,020
sure they're about nets they were owned
by people are either in prison or

658
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,170
disbanded or

659
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:45,510
have gone underground so that would mean
presumably that's

660
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,370
there's a numerous man it's out there
that are not controlled by anyone at the

661
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,130
moment

662
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,680
right and I'm wondering aside from

663
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,410
source routing or something like that is
there a way to take those

664
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,460
over and here I'm will

665
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,650
its funnies it actually is this kind of
like com

666
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,010
through the big problem in the whole
like how do you deal with but that's

667
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,920
because

668
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,859
it's not it's relatively easy dish shut
down there

669
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,880
the command center but its

670
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,549
pretty much impossible to you bad
disinfect

671
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:24,759
the network Mike I mean the basically
you can kind the best thing that you can

672
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,660
do as you can

673
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,790
arm you can get kind of the general

674
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:32,100
like a min if you can get eyes peas in
such to you block

675
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,319
you know to ignore the track you know
those those traffic calls by

676
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:39,009
the computers themselves out there
zombies their gonna always do that

677
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:39,730
forever

678
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,230
om taking over I think basically the
thing is is that once

679
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,480
went once the network has been shut down
by somebody

680
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,240
I wouldn want to try to take over that
because the whole point is is that

681
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,170
people have already shut it down you
like 12 big dude who used to be running

682
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,240
is in jail

683
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,760
back now I can't really take it over
make

684
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,200
at a known it doesn't seem like the best
idea like by

685
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,589
I mean I don't actually specifically now

686
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:10,420
by mean there's no I mean basically
there's an knew anybody

687
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,500
likely anybody you could hat you know
who knows so they can at like the

688
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,510
password

689
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,690
arm for I'm you know running the network

690
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:23,330
you know being the kind you of being
authenticated as the

691
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,740
the owner the channel for example fits
our entire scene

692
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,250
by net then your day your

693
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,830
your the command om be at ninety
basically

694
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:37,819
it's that type thing months now on the
other hand like I you could certainly

695
00:42:37,819 --> 00:42:41,220
for example I I have a feeling like if
you wanted to you could add go

696
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,940
and you know on your own

697
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,400
try to find other peoples but not for
having been like you know Kat yet and

698
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,650
try to take them over from the people

699
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,589
and you could brick it dates you know
it's relatively easy to start your own

700
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:57,730
but now it's basically

701
00:42:57,730 --> 00:43:00,859
you denied

702
00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:04,160
okay and

703
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,220
the yeah I know I i mean at some point
through

704
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:11,470
I mean that's why a if like people ever
start like really in planting stuff in

705
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:14,880
their heads as you know or think where
you taking over people RF

706
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,460
implanted RFID you know like you can do
them

707
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,210
you know some great stuff by people have
like implanted credit cards

708
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,460
and you know and you can start doing
these things

709
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:28,460
om a are we at one

710
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,740
you're out well since I'll give if you
want I can do some little

711
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,770
I'm you know dead tree

712
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,910
and no transfers arm so

713
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:42,589
my dead space dot com is is fun

714
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:45,830
and sky easy remember I one if

715
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,210
actually when the most interesting I
never really wish I could have called it

716
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,500
up because it's kinda grief

717
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,410
when the speakers at hi h2k

718
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:58,859
the 2000 hope ways I Chris McKinstry

719
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:02,400
who is this guy who on with running the

720
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,069
the mind pixel on mine pixel general
artificial consciousness project

721
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:11,680
in which he was like in people like type
in little things a little statements

722
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,509
that are either true or false

723
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:16,810
news compiling this like data and the
scene

724
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,120
this whole list what people

725
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,600
you can about the general knowledge of
humanity and it was all going to be

726
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,990
compiled into this kind of like you know

727
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,200
artificial intelligence that would have
this emergent intelligence

728
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,990
om in he had been Mike working down

729
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:36,040
in the radio telescopes down in

730
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,460
South America and helping to Mike
discover supernovas

731
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,960
things on unfortunately try

732
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,369
he was kind of like and you know how
many people have you seen a beautiful

733
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:47,250
mind

734
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,349
but he was kind of like what's his name

735
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:55,369
there the actor Russell Crowe Union down
ash

736
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,660
um and he a and in he was kinda like
that merits he was he was

737
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,170
was somebody who was genuinely very
smart but he was also completely crazy

738
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:06,230
om and so the

739
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:10,079
at the mine picture projects with very
much kind of like masses

740
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,349
little II conspiratorial jottings where

741
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:18,170
the the information coming in and you
know it's all real minutes you know any

742
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,160
really was compiling into a database but
there was no

743
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,819
Michael artificial intelligence Mike
what do it it

744
00:45:24,819 --> 00:45:28,490
all we do is kind of like two-thirds the
time he would guess yes

745
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,859
and went through the time would say you
know Institute there's a time and say

746
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:32,920
this is a true statement

747
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,270
and one you know through time with this
is awesome was known

748
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:39,540
there was no intelligence no you know
parsing this

749
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,279
and II it in

750
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,329
2000 for

751
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,550
I believe he i wrote

752
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:54,099
non might suicide now he said this is
what an online suicide note looks like

753
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,230
me had various quotes about you know
killing yourself

754
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,569
from various I speakers com and

755
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,170
and Mike the next day he did om and

756
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:07,670
II its Syrian the

757
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:11,500
like you you know and it but now some
unfortunately so and I actually found

758
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,980
out about this because I was like

759
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,260
can if looking up some we're all day I
stuff in aid you know

760
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,740
bookmarked in camp on this and I quit
wait a second you

761
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:24,450
you know makes I read the blog wait a
second this is a little weird

762
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,740
and then now I you know internet he'd
kill himself unfortunately they like the

763
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,810
that like that page has been taken down
but it's been archived

764
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:34,900
com and

765
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,730
said there's so there's in a and in and
that is one of the things is like a lot

766
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,750
of the things fade away

767
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,960
and it's quite possible that my spaces

768
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,170
%ah been i win you know it its

769
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,740
a good bet that within the next five ten
years or less than that

770
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:55,160
myspace will have a whole division of
people that

771
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,770
you know when home institutional policy
for wise policy about how to deal

772
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,839
with the profiles people who've died

773
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:06,400
om you know like in Michael B

774
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,839
hi it'll be probably a standard thing
the prettier Mike wheeler

775
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,009
you know next attorney or something
really like you know in since

776
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:18,359
missus big thing because most people who
are 15 don't have wheels but they have

777
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:19,650
what MySpace pages

778
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,960
I am so at some point like when you
create your

779
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,319
you know your myspace profile you're
probably be asked to fill out like a

780
00:47:27,319 --> 00:47:28,349
provisional will

781
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:31,720
tonight transfer electronic assets to
you you know I

782
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,140
you know what your electronic you know
World of Warcraft myspace et cetera

783
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:39,920
next two cannons com and

784
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,770
and then all you know and then like this
this agents on the school

785
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,890
sadly fade away

786
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:50,848
and would just be left with people more
nicely buried

787
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:55,339
I guess that might be a good place to
end the talking with but we have time

788
00:47:55,339 --> 00:47:56,720
for like one or two more questions

789
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,900
but otherwise I will thank you all

790
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,640
fact okay get one

791
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,009
affect question as just wondering what
your take is

792
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,109
distributed computing way to

793
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:16,900
for cancer said would

794
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,550
might do any capabilities at those
companies

795
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:24,550
well I mean there's def wanna I mean
there's real

796
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,599
stuff is mean that's any project

797
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:31,020
is well it's also it's a good example

798
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:36,540
I mean you know like it's a kinda
probably quixotic pursuits happen

799
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:40,779
I'm but you know the but but like yeah i
right i mean but on

800
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,910
things that is kinda like on problems
that are no

801
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:48,180
nope we doable with like you know by
supercomputers like protein folding

802
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,520
arm and like you searching through

803
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,130
I am genetic materials I mean there's

804
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,380
absolutely no redeeming disturb you can
get if they have

805
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,650
essentially as long as it's the right
kind of task they have

806
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,000
essentially equivalent power arm you
know

807
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,310
traditional supercomputer om

808
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:12,450
there are like unfair

809
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,780
kinda cutting-edge research if I grid
computing

810
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,040
arm where in when it kinda ironies is
that

811
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,420
its the the Internet ARPANET

812
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:29,349
I coulda the carpet was originally
designed to as a distributed computing

813
00:49:29,349 --> 00:49:32,730
network like the idea that people would
use the network to communicate with each

814
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,480
other

815
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,000
was not what it was about is about
sharing

816
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,319
use time sharing about sharing resources
on the on

817
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,619
having the computer share the resources
so you'd have effectively

818
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:46,680
I'm a more power for computing grid and

819
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,140
that you know viene academic research

820
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,750
an approach has has never stopped om and

821
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:58,299
but the now what that will end up being

822
00:49:58,299 --> 00:50:01,960
you know 5 10 25 50 years from now mean
you can

823
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,780
you make your extrapolations and you
know read William Gibson and

824
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:11,359
and Eric Drexler and staff and you will
have immersion consciousness is and

825
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,640
Matthew

826
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,629
believe that the human mind is magic in
can't be paralleled

827
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,819
by computers because they're you know
binary or something

828
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,900
by in the yeah I mean like I think

829
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,339
you basically you should have your
computer be doing distributed computing

830
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:28,609
stuff it's a

831
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:32,020
it's a a good thing and

832
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,040
mean on the other hand Mike you burning
you know you

833
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,799
using a nerd you're using electricity so
you like eating a better

834
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:42,380
we're using its all these computers
wearing away

835
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:45,680
you know by yeah I know it's a good
thing

836
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,328
so abo I think the most interesting
thing there's just that

837
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:52,780
be Mike by net the

838
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,230
do widget in a distributed computing
world in the by net world

839
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,079
are basically the same size

840
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:07,079
I'm well thanks a lot and I come again

841
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:49,850
dishes

842
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,580
like that it's really easy on screen now
you can see it is I quickly sold

843
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:57,180
guy can you PT on the Mac and TPT male

844
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:03,390
and is I'm dismay lap on the Mac it just
got it and an extra menu

845
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,589
that

846
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:08,420
next time when you hear PCP for the
configuration

847
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:12,570
you can configure everything as well we
really have to stop now

848
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:16,430
but will take these two questions and I
will stop a question about the

849
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:20,700
browsing encryption abused or or
something want your ISP still have

850
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,730
records very thing hours at encrypt it
to them to

851
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,950
it you get to think ripped it's a great
you also doing

852
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:31,109
you starting creeps into the first node
in any goes with it or network

853
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:32,790
the ice cream social condition
