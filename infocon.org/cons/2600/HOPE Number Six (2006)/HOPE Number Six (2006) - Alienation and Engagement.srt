1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,929
its 6 p.m. this is room be we have

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:08,450
a presenter who was outdo the airplane
troubles yesterday

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,530
talk to our schedules alienation
engagement and has graciously agreed to

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:13,200
come in

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,080
speak to you now he

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,080
leaving I have a couple announcements
before

7
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,500
he get started now I'm project MF

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,630
which is in the a track has been moved

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:38,460
to 20 100 hours which okay

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,420
make get out your pen sketches requires
a diagram off the hook was

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,550
originally scheduled but it was replaced
with kevin Mitnick

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,540
kevin Mitnick when last we heard was

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:56,360
medically indisposed in Columbia I don't
know any details I just three days in a

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,790
hospital in Columbia

15
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:03,290
you know I couldn't tell you far as I
know it's Bogut I don't know

16
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:10,289
he may even be in Columbia hospital in
your I don't know

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,100
I

18
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,290
so project IMF has been moved to 20 100

19
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,549
in room and a quantum cryptosporidium
cancelled

20
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,940
alienation engagement has been
rescheduled here now

21
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:31,940
and Steve Ram BAM is currently not

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:38,369
over in the panel in room and you or no
one

23
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,189
rumor has it that no

24
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,680
no no no this is the funny part is
mixing Columbia Ram BAM got arrested

25
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,530
I'd

26
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,210
you know I others and the fact that they
told me to make that announcement or

27
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,229
nothing about it

28
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:05,280
alright so are we ready yeah

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,068
okay this is number 58 chasing for all

30
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:17,069
doing alienation engagement now

31
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,859
ok good this is all okay well

32
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,069
I know a lot of you were expecting a a
super technical talk and now you're

33
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:31,470
going to get a a personal rant

34
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:34,640
that I somehow convince the 2600 people
the Latin

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,080
do bad on the plus side you get to

36
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,680
look at me trying to be dressed up I get
a kick out of that

37
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,890
and since this is a talk about the
mainstream i

38
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,900
thought I would do something that the
mainstream

39
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,220
laos now you put on the cost him

40
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:59,220
and they treat you better so

41
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,180
our sense ok social responsibility

42
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,180
the idea that we are responsible for the
world that we live in

43
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,970
that we don't like the way everything is
going in that we want to do something

44
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,019
about it is undermined by the fact that
we and the mainstream

45
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:23,930
do not get along now the mainstream I
think we all know

46
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:29,730
what's wrong with them and well we don't
need to enumerate these things but

47
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,950
specifically what they

48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,400
don't like about I i suppose is that we
outsmart them

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,940
as their mentor headset and they don't
forgive us for that

50
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,730
but it's worse they're terrified a
anyone who has

51
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,870
some kinda mastery over technology in a

52
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,120
they're afraid of us

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,489
and then really feel more comfortable if
we were all in prison

54
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,680
in fact a lot of them make jokes about
what wonderful things might happen to us

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,849
in prison and a

56
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,390
bubble with glee as though this would be
a a delightful outcome for them

57
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,780
so they are dangerous and that's a good
thing that we have

58
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,209
you know laws in the constitution to
protect us from what they

59
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,750
might do if they but getting a mob and
do it to us

60
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,260
now

61
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,738
they're not entirely to blame for this
state have

62
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:24,729
avail in nation I think on our part we
have cultivated a certain mystique of

63
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:25,300
being

64
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,190
more powerful and for likely a more
alert and

65
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,240
rate not having the exact same moral
values that the mainstream has

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,680
and you know the mainstream venerate
some violence and

67
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,680
basic instincts and so it's very hard to
share all of its values you know a lot

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,789
about thinker

69
00:04:43,789 --> 00:04:48,310
rather gentle intellectual sorts whether
a technical sourcer

70
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,360
book or MS but in any event they don't
get along

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,780
us and were born into this world for
with them

72
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,389
we have some problems I think a lot of
hackers

73
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,889
have had the school problem you get to
school and it doesn't work out for you

74
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:04,270
usually you are

75
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,409
too smart to deal with it you get bored
quickly you can't accept the authority

76
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,690
of the teachers because in your mind
they don't really deserve

77
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,050
yet they're kinda down in their kind
babysitting %um

78
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,200
no one enjoys that we want to be engaged
and

79
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,960
and how what we do is challenge
authority

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,289
and what they hate his people to
challenge authority so they kick this

81
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:28,099
around in the very back to us

82
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:31,190
now if you're very lucky what

83
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,360
happened to bill gates might happen to
you the parents realize there's a

84
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,050
problem they put you on a school with
really smart people and people can say

85
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,550
I'm glad you're smart

86
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,159
I'm not gon kick it down I'm going to
help you and your trio and

87
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,500
figure out what you're good at mean Bill
Gates you now have a lot of trouble he

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,599
got in a lot of trouble at Lakeside in
this

89
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,229
nearly expelled from harvard is well but

90
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,050
you know he got what he needed when he
needed it and he's engaged with the

91
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,280
mainstream I know a lot of histone
approve a lot of the things that

92
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,270
he has done in the past with this
software but at the same time

93
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,299
he's more wanna I say think that he is

94
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,159
wanna them now after the school problem
love

95
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,650
it's quite often involves physical
violence from people anything going to

96
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,700
Slashdot and just mentioned bowling

97
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:24,190
you'll get pages and pages Ranson really
violent revenge fantasies about these

98
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,380
horrible things that are happening the
smart kids who just wanted to do well in

99
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,050
school

100
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,380
well that's fine and somehow we managed
to survive because people can survive

101
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,390
just about anything

102
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,490
but then we go to to college or wherever
we pop out in the world and we want to

103
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,979
develop software

104
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:43,490
have our tech hobbies and we find
they're all these laws being passed to

105
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,630
stop us from doing that because the
mainstream doesn't understand us

106
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:52,510
well we can deal with some of that but
when it gets so egregiously corrupt

107
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,570
this IP property grab this content
property Graham where

108
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,659
every image in every sound gets

109
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,760
copping written if that were copyrighted
and held

110
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,900
by some library that wants to charge
royalties and

111
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,280
firms just make a project and patent

112
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,300
every single idea that they could in
that project

113
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,990
so they can block competitors and more
importantly they can say

114
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,340
you know here we have some assets or
stock is worth more in

115
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,250
all love that you know we feel like we
want to contribute and here were the

116
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,080
smart people and we could do it

117
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,330
but they're all these very corrupt
people who are just stealing things in

118
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,969
locking things up and then we think well
how much

119
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:39,259
progress can I make because everything
is patented and I can't do anything

120
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,900
where everything's copyright and it's a
very very frustrating because you want

121
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,860
to help the world and its

122
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,960
actively stopping you from doing that
well

123
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,449
the other thing that can happen with
with technical people is that we get

124
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,350
bored

125
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:57,669
computers I myself have gotten
fantastically border than at many times

126
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:58,680
and

127
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,910
I've gone for years without using them

128
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,190
well using them not coding hardcore anal
with that

129
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,669
and what I've discovered is that hackers
are basically good

130
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,979
anything they try to be good at so

131
00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:17,240
you take this hacker mindset a just
figuring out how things work

132
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,690
and you apply it to anything and you can
do that fairly well

133
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,009
sometimes it can take a little bit of
work

134
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,830
and I know for people to whom everything
comes easily

135
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,078
you know admitting that you have to work
harder something like math

136
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:35,660
can be difficult but if if you do it
things turn out pretty well

137
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,679
so I wanted to talk about 3

138
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,120
areas where technical people are people
with the hacker mindset

139
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,620
can have a positive impact on mainstream
society

140
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,360
in a non-technical way is a things you
can do if you have the heck a mentality

141
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,100
are you

142
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,410
if you have the technical background but
you don't want to be Joe programming for

143
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:57,069
the rest of your life

144
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,500
and these are things that I have some
experience and

145
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,550
journalism academic economics

146
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,219
and law admittedly I don't know very
much about law and I'm

147
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,870
glad about that because the way that we
usually find out about laws less than

148
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,000
pleasant

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,589
but I did have an interesting stent in
journalism during the dot-com boom I'll

150
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:19,040
just

151
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,089
just before it rather until just after
it

152
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:27,589
I got hired at age twenty as the the
technical editor of this magazine called

153
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:28,810
Lynn external

154
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,829
and this was a position for which I was
completely and totally unqualified

155
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,829
by everyone who was qualified was
working at a dot com

156
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,260
getting into seven figures that stock
options you know these for

157
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,449
very rich kids so I could speak English
and I could pretend to know about things

158
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:50,969
and that was enough well I was also
willing to work at low wages which you

159
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,980
always have to do appear in journalism

160
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,000
but its fun while you're there and you
do

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,620
get to meet a lot of people and you can
influence people

162
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,540
you know you can say to these venture
capitalists these 1x firms are really

163
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,730
great and he's business people are
really sharp and I'll get money and then

164
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,720
they can become self-sustaining so you
can have some influence in journalism

165
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,620
or even changing people's opinions about
things you know one thing I tried to do

166
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,280
well I was there was

167
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,410
get the Lenox people in the Slashdot had
to stop looking down at the 2600 people

168
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,050
on

169
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,250
people who were interested in security
is

170
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,470
though weirdest snobbery between these
two groups that I thought was just

171
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,190
completely irrational

172
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,250
and especially when the mainstream
doesn't really like either one of us

173
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,610
that well

174
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,810
you know it seemed to me that you know
we could get along a bit better and I

175
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,110
think nowadays

176
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,670
and nothing's there pretty good with the

177
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,610
the occasional outburst on Slashdot have

178
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:52,970
you are pounder some such

179
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,740
and now so

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,290
in journalism we do need people who can
explain to the mainstream

181
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,530
technical issues in a rather and I say

182
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,370
unbiased way because of course nothing
can be unbiased its

183
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:15,110
biases how you choose one statement or
one hypothesis from infinitely many

184
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,150
believe valid hypotheses but we need to
give them

185
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,050
a good understanding of technology in
technological issues so that they can

186
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:24,920
make

187
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,140
decisions or at least be informed when
they're

188
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,430
voting they're spending money here
talking to their friends you know I

189
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,089
think that their interests would
coincide with our interests a lot more

190
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:36,620
than their interests coincide with

191
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,220
is no industry consortiums that right
now they tend to support

192
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,540
in now so

193
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,209
that's one area and I think a lot of
people

194
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:51,279
in this room could do a better job than
a lot of

195
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,970
journalists who cover tech further the
masses

196
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,470
does anyone here think you would be a
worse journalist in john markoff

197
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:03,860
for example well I don't know I guess we
could ask Kevin

198
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,360
that bad

199
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,700
there's another trick with journalism
which is that if you can put a sentence

200
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,430
together

201
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:17,500
people will listen to you because people
understand tech

202
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,750
generally don't read it on a lyrics are
so

203
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,980
they sometimes don't write so well
people who can write

204
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:28,110
very well just about never understand
tak so if you can put together a

205
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,630
coherent paragraph you can send it into
just about any publication and I'll

206
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,089
print it for you

207
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,089
it's really funny that way but they're
desperate for material they have

208
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,769
deadlines and I'll take what they can
get so

209
00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:43,300
you can influence people that way or
hack into the media I guess that's what

210
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,880
magellan always says don't hate
immediately come the media and

211
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,890
well the media if you're willing to
accept lower wages

212
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,600
is a thing that you can get into and
where you can have some influence

213
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
so another subject of mine that I like
to rant about us economics because I

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,620
happen to think that

215
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,040
economics is an academic fraud

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,410
and I realize that's a very strong

217
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,519
crackpot statement you now have it all
these fancy places MIT and Harvard and

218
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,839
Princeton with the schmidts the
Economics Department

219
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,360
be no taking part in a fraud well

220
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,370
it is not so out and out I'm

221
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,850
basically I think as john fund I'm in
thought and

222
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,880
Norbert Wiener thought and even
Friedrich Hayek thought that

223
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,610
economists used the wrong mathematical
language to describe their theories

224
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,410
they tried to import the mathematics
behind physics

225
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,290
instead of using a new math that might
describe economic processes

226
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,180
well then you can build on these
theoretical models the say this will

227
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,889
happen if you do this and this will
happen if you do that

228
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:50,290
and then you can build policy on so you
come up with something you call it the

229
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,569
laffer curve

230
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,570
and suddenly it has this instant
respectability and people say

231
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,750
well how well it must work it must be
real cuz these great Greece's economic

232
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,339
success so

233
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,639
well they have a lot of funny ideas the
people in academic economics

234
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,200
and if you have a hacker's background
you can come in and say

235
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,810
guys this is what's going on I know that
this can't be happening these people

236
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,470
can't be perfectly rational they can't
be perfectly informed

237
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,690
this process is not an actual Ibrahim
process this process is not a random

238
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,990
walk there are trends senator what not

239
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,180
I realize that's very highfalutin any
typically would need some kind of math

240
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,740
background to

241
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,399
now make those kind of argument but the
other problem is that economists

242
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,779
basically don't understand tech

243
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,519
markets they think they do which is what
a dangerous about it so they don't

244
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,550
really understand

245
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,850
issues about protocols and

246
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,480
standards and national monopolies in the
industry

247
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,000
and in particular they don't understand

248
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,029
libraries and how important libraries
are

249
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,810
and the damage that patents and
copyrights can do the basic attitude as

250
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,949
well or better with something without
them therefore

251
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,329
we can have them for 90 or 100 years and
whatever who cares

252
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:13,709
you now the system's basically work more
than half somewhere so

253
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,079
keep that well if you've ever had a
fight at a really hard level with a

254
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,130
machine

255
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,839
you have a different understanding love
library standards

256
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,420
API's than a guy who now draws some
graphs and says here's the equilibrium

257
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,889
so on I think we could really help them
to understand

258
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:36,480
tech markets a little better and if you
could get them to admit that they don't

259
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,730
know them that well

260
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,959
you know maybe the models that they
present to policymakers

261
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,990
would start reflecting actual interests

262
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,130
people who value technology in progress
rather than

263
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,279
no entrenched industries that want to
stay put or what

264
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,820
I'm I think we're going to see a lot
love

265
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,880
upheaval in the economics field in a few
years I think people are going to

266
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,959
realize

267
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,760
more and more that their this talk about
random walks the prices in the market or

268
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,800
a random walk in you can never predict
the market it better than

269
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,800
the growth rate or what not is going to
turn out to be

270
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,709
exposed and tossed out all that because
obviously you couldn't have speculators

271
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:19,089
if markets worries that actually bring
them in

272
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:22,769
you wouldn't have trends if everything
were around walk and there's a great

273
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:25,589
deal more going on that but i i think

274
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:28,600
social sciences being less rigorous than

275
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,810
a lot it feels can get away with crazy
ideas for a lot longer

276
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,970
cell the next thing

277
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,420
but i wanna talk about his law and

278
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,750
I know we find law frustrating because

279
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,529
usually la just Co defies the society's
norms

280
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,480
you're not supposed to hit people are
still things here do this or do that

281
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,940
but sometimes special interests think
that

282
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,860
self-interest is the order of the day
because the economics professors tell

283
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,050
and so on

284
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:05,939
they think it's fine to by favors from
politicians and bylaws

285
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,389
so you get a lot of laws that are
written in the interests

286
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:12,780
a have these big

287
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,439
corporations that have paid for them
which are not always

288
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,189
against our interests in fact all a lot
love

289
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:24,949
at the American monopolies that the
government supports it does so because

290
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:28,659
at least their American monopolies and
not for in monopoly is

291
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:32,230
and a lot of the patent law at least
their American pass enough foreign

292
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,040
patents so

293
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,800
its it's very difficult actually to find
out

294
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,990
where your personal interests lie on
these things

295
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,139
but a there are some areas where we can
help

296
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:50,990
the legal system and one is just through
journalism informing people including

297
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,610
lawyers about the actual

298
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,970
issues are and what it looks like a
technical level

299
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,000
now we don't really need more lawyers in
the world

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,909
so I wouldn't say you know get your CS
degree in go to law school

301
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:06,659
at the same time there are going to be
lawyers

302
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:11,850
we need them to protect us from other
lawyers mostly but we do need them

303
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,760
and they are going to keep going to law
school and appearing and we'd be better

304
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,389
off

305
00:18:16,389 --> 00:18:22,500
if there were lawyers who had a hacker's
mindset who knew about technology

306
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,530
you know who were smart basically clever
people with

307
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:30,408
with principles instead of this dogma
self-interested

308
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,710
whatever I can get away with under the
laws okay it's mine this is rational

309
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,040
it's going to help the system by

310
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,470
using it in very very strange ideas that
people have

311
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:44,990
now another thing about the law we know
that it's a very unpleasant

312
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,300
when the law gets engaged when you break
a law that's fine and dandy because a

313
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,210
lot of them are pretty silly in

314
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,810
you know they don't really affect anyone
anyway

315
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,629
have these victimless crimes ur you're
not supposed to copy CDs at your house

316
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,270
or what not and

317
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,570
you know that's fine and maybe you have
mp3 a movie collections

318
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,918
but the moment you get in trouble for it

319
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,060
they come down on you way out of
proportion to what you actually did

320
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,840
now if you have good technical solutions
to things you can quite often avoid

321
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,060
having to kick in the legal solutions

322
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,690
which means that you'll see less

323
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:31,210
teenagers going to prison if we have
computers that are just simply more

324
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,409
secure

325
00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:36,350
if you make it technically difficult for
people to break laws

326
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,419
then people do break them less
frequently and for lot doesn't have to

327
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,730
get involved in people don't have to get

328
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,290
in beaten up because the law once it
does get started

329
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,540
it doesn't understand technical issues
for one point it's

330
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,260
terrified of what technical people can I
might be doing and

331
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,300
it's just better if we help the law not
have to

332
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,500
get engaged in the first place

333
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,870
know whether whether this means
providing anonymity software for

334
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,070
whistleblowers

335
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:14,020
or no just tightening systems providing
photography and corruption schemes that

336
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,720
actually

337
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,260
working or not just funny

338
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,619
you know nominal examples nominal locks
on doors they can charge you with

339
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:22,770
breaking and entering

340
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:28,000
now so that is what I have to say about
law

341
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,619
so the question is the while engaged
with mainstream society

342
00:20:32,619 --> 00:20:37,428
these people who are afraid of view and
wanna lock you in jail or

343
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:40,530
you know these executives who look at
you is worker bees

344
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,090
unfit to be in any sort of leadership
position

345
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,010
probably a little a more of a very
clever and very useful at the moment

346
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:52,200
a source of labor whose wages are to be
kept down in ours are to be kept up for

347
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,070
one

348
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,389
well the only way good things happen is
if

349
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:03,270
people do engage that I don't think many
people are born in this world and say

350
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,080
gosh I really love this place the way it
is I wanna keep it this way it's fair

351
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,010
and Justin

352
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,609
people treat each other very well this
is exactly what I asked for before I was

353
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:13,270
born

354
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,840
you know so it it does take people with
principle and i think thats

355
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,060
sees yes are you going to take questions
are

356
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm just saying a lot of people are
going out the room and I thought we

357
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,280
could make this a little more lively

358
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,428
hi I mean you're you're talking about

359
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:34,840
engaging with the mainstream yes

360
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,270
I mean do you want to do that well so we
take questions at the end then

361
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,700
I'm just I'm on your side just people
are leaving

362
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,040
and there's something going on in the
next room that I think the intelligence

363
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,520
in this room

364
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,849
could okay

365
00:21:54,849 --> 00:22:00,050
yeah they were expecting quantum
cryptography

366
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:04,139
yes I will I will take questions at the
end I suppose

367
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:09,230
so is it worth engaging with the world I

368
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,659
think it is i mean on some level you
have to and I think that if you engage

369
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:14,820
in more than a technical level

370
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,060
better things can happen I see a lot of
potential with hackers

371
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,418
you now and I don't want to wake up
twenty years from now

372
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:27,700
and think that boy we were really
interesting once we had all this

373
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,750
potential

374
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,139
this was our air at this was in the
world was run by technical people in

375
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,300
need a technical people

376
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,490
and we've done nothing where have we
gone well

377
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,750
I don't want that happen I don't want
that to happen to me and I

378
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,990
I don't want people to get so frustrated
with the world that they

379
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:51,629
give up on it and just vent a lot of
anger

380
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:54,940
on web pages so

381
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,240
I think we have a lot of potential and

382
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,260
I hope that even if you get bored with
computers

383
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,408
Sunday decide you don't want to be a
program-record

384
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,960
you will be aware that there are

385
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,419
other ways in which the world needs you
and that the mainstream

386
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:15,840
isn't as hopeless as it feels most of
the time

387
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,060
so I wish all good luck and I suppose aw

388
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:27,060
take questions now

389
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:40,690
what is it that you do professionally
well I just got a a master's in computer

390
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,270
science and

391
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,889
I've been doing some bookkeeping work to
keep employed and right now I'm on a job

392
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:47,260
hunt

393
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,290
the higher yes it's really

394
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,860
difficult for now on

395
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,170
I definitely empathize with your

396
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:06,550
general theme behind social
responsibility

397
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,010
on me greater level and

398
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,390
the stuff that you're talking about is
very

399
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,600
broad I mean serve attacking

400
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,580
economics at its crux and saying that
it's like

401
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,030
full science or just based on totally
species reasoning

402
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,360
and so on and so forth would is there
actually some sort of

403
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,970
construct or specifics

404
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,670
the you would give to people who are
sort of in charge

405
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:42,570
love critical systems infrastructure

406
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,919
that requires technical know-how yet

407
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,820
actually plays they plane all sort of
decision-making role

408
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,950
in the way said infrastructure is
utilized

409
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:57,160
are you saying that will we should start
to do

410
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,990
is make these decisions even if

411
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,260
the people who actually quote-unquote
own them

412
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,610
would find what we decide to do with
them

413
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,010
totally anathema to their own goals

414
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,730
a very probably not but you certainly
could help people to be informed and

415
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,310
have rational discussions about what's
best rather than

416
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,560
that the rhetoric that tends to dominate
American political

417
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,590
discourse I don't know specifically what
you mean about

418
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:34,040
critical infrastructure you were saying
essentially that

419
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,200
there's a lot of people

420
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,590
here with technical know-how on how
systems

421
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:45,430
they're very much needed by our economy

422
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,480
work capitalistic society or so on so
forth in order to function properly

423
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,960
and there's a lot of bureaucracy and so
on and so forth in

424
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,550
there a lot of us are sort of alienated
hence the

425
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:00,919
title is this lecture whatever

426
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,190
your call this and the point is though

427
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,350
that you're saying we should act in some
sort of way

428
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,860
yeah I went right now and anything
illegal per se

429
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,980
I'm not meaning anything illegal either

430
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:19,280
but at the same time like what

431
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,940
is it that you're actually trying to get

432
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:26,800
people to be convinced of that they
should do

433
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,180
I mean you object to the weights on
these

434
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,810
systems are used

435
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:37,980
or the way some the systems are
structured fundamentally

436
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,780
are we just supposed is you know agree
with you

437
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,899
and go home in that's it or I mean is
there something beyond

438
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,390
justs being cognizant of what it is
you're saying

439
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:54,150
your trying to you know put forward here

440
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:58,680
well I personally get very

441
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,170
very frustrated to the point or I think
why bother

442
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,130
qua quite often and I think I don't want
to have to go to school and getting

443
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:10,760
an MBA just so I can straighten
bureaucracy and

444
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,890
I am assuming that a lot of people have
felt this at some point or another a

445
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,520
great deal

446
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,540
frustration and mostly I want you to
know that

447
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,760
at least I also feel that

448
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,400
and that you can

449
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,360
do other things you can do journalism
you can do

450
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,540
economics there are other things open to
you if you ever

451
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:39,540
just get completely second being
summoned code monkey for example

452
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,939
I thought the questions would make
lively

453
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:52,720
appreciate what he was when you were
talking about

454
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,929
entering into the mainstream and then
perhaps going as as a journalist

455
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,049
because you know if you have writing
skills you could take something that was

456
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:01,970
technical

457
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,370
and land yeah it you know and then you
also said maybe you could stop

458
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,150
illegal things happening by making it
more difficult to do

459
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,169
illegal things I would like to know a
little bit more about your frustration

460
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:18,090
and the others

461
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,419
who have a big huge technical capacity
which

462
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,230
down I'm just a simple person who
wonders why for example

463
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,320
building number seven and 911 came down
10

464
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,480
when no airplanes went into and

465
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,529
it often seems like highly technical
people get

466
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:42,700
get very involved in figuring how things
work out

467
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,220
where's there's very big things yeah I'm
wondering what's the nature of your

468
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,340
frustration

469
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:51,730
well I'd like to I'd like to connect
with you more in that case I sense

470
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:58,080
you are very concerned about blending
into society

471
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,168
and yet and yet it doesn't take a very
technical person to say

472
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:07,620
a building came down with no airplanes
going into it and no investigation

473
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,190
and and other people in society defer to
people like you and people in this room

474
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,029
well it's true that some of us do have a
tendency to get

475
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:20,140
carried away with more extreme wind
thinking they're

476
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:24,850
we sometimes tend towards political
extremes I think they're probably very

477
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,860
few conservative Democrats are moderate
republicans relative to say that

478
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,539
quite as a libertarian things around we
can fall for

479
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:38,179
for overly simplistic ideologies that
don't account for the complexity of the

480
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:39,279
world we think that

481
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,909
its is linear as assembly code and if we
could just work out the rules would

482
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:44,990
understand everything and of course is
often

483
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,990
doesn't work out that way and sometimes
it's hard to know when you have

484
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,070
technical expertise that would apply

485
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,299
to a certain area and when you wouldn't
I personally don't know anything about

486
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,559
architecture structural engineering

487
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:02,250
down I don't know why some buildings go
down it amazes me that skyscrapers stay

488
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,169
up on a Wendy's

489
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,789
blowing I don't have to wonder if either

490
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:10,510
don't you think it's worth but but what
you're saying is you don't know you're

491
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,669
not an architect

492
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:15,399
isn't it also something for someone to
think about why has there been no

493
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:16,580
investigation

494
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:22,360
why right now is a war going on in the
middle east that's just a fact you said

495
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,159
to be an American at least the the
intellectual property was going to

496
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,049
americans

497
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:31,580
but what does it mean to be an American
one we've lost so much

498
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,030
for of

499
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:39,010
our liberties freedom's just based on
things like

500
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,049
a building coming down with no airplanes
going into yeah

501
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:46,020
it & Rosati noticing it frustrates me a
great deal I just have to tell myself

502
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,350
that what goes wrong

503
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:50,950
here isn't as bad as what goes wrong
elsewhere

504
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,649
you know things have been worsen

505
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:57,840
Germany and Austria and France and

506
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,799
so far things here oh yes please

507
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:06,460
and anyone else aside from a career
change

508
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:10,010
recommendations would you have for
engaging mainstream to convince people

509
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,090
that the internet is not

510
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:16,740
series 15

511
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,580
well I think it's it's important to be

512
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,449
sincere and patient with people not the
font that you have technical

513
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,510
knowledge and some area to be patient
not to get

514
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,520
angry at people when they ask you
questions that you think

515
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,668
might not be so clever like can I get
the internet on my computer

516
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:37,010
you know I'm patience I think

517
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,289
is very important treating people with

518
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:44,090
respect recognizing that you're worth as
a human being is not a function

519
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,630
your technical skill

520
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,600
yes another question the career path

521
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,690
fashion I'm wondering what you

522
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,780
hope to achieve with the Masters in me

523
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,120
computer science most people who've been
in the business have had to make a

524
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,970
choice

525
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,510
at probably a group after a few years
being in it

526
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,480
have continuing and the technical path
to learn more at center

527
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,659
words shifting over to a managerial site
so we see we end up with people

528
00:32:17,659 --> 00:32:20,720
were managers were semi educated in

529
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,070
this the very stuff they're so supposed
to supervise

530
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:29,230
with the basically contempt from the
people that their supervising

531
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:34,730
because their ignorance and you and
obviously this is not

532
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,140
this is not a good situation and as a as
a business

533
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,230
you into I as a career

534
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:46,400
I remember when their use resilience
COBOL programmers

535
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,169
in now if you go to a user's Oracle
group to see

536
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:53,390
zillions of work former programmers

537
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:56,400
you know what is the future as a career

538
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,789
and you know as far as the technical
side

539
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:03,780
you know from I'm tell us now that you
have your man stirs

540
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,668
well I personally tend to value

541
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:11,909
computers as support in other fields
that I think are very important

542
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,059
you know Medical Sciences and

543
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:18,770
those sorts of things I think computers
can play a very strong supporting

544
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,158
role in many human endeavor is not
necessarily

545
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,250
computers for the sake of computers of
course

546
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:28,880
those things don't pay as well as
manufacturing cell phone ringtones

547
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,240
software so and I will have to see I

548
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,390
down an hour per future holds for me and
probably not most exemplary

549
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:39,690
an official out there by you knowing but
rather

550
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,010
to the best my understanding with
techies

551
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,408
the ones that go too hard for tech rout
as a lot of my friends have done this

552
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:46,840
you

553
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,419
try to get a job at a big firm straight
out of college grad school

554
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,780
and then you worked there for two to
five years maybe become a project

555
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,710
manager build up a social network

556
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,770
and then when people leave to do
startups the ring you up winning

557
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,879
employees and people seem to be do very
well that way

558
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,130
I'm not sure if that's the path I was
take

559
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,869
to some extent is very difficult if you
promote the really good technical people

560
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:16,770
then you've lost a really good technical
people to management whereas if you

561
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,668
from out the the bad technical people
you make it really done management so

562
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,060
I understand some companies like
Microsoft try to promote the

563
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,099
the most technical people the project
managers and

564
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,050
I don't know if after study up on
management

565
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,649
think of a PO that cuz I'm working
towards my PhD in Computer Science in

566
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:37,460
physics

567
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,580
if you decide to go online to do you say

568
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,168
masters or higher degrees you have

569
00:34:44,168 --> 00:34:48,429
were talking the question is your
targeted toward private industry Richard

570
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:51,820
private corporations like Microsoft you
know a picture

571
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,800
a their publicly-traded they're still
private companies

572
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,040
commercial industries but you still have

573
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,740
I don't people like it you still have
nasa

574
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,740
or you have the in a few don't work for
the federal government you still have

575
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,380
international Space Administration which
really does need people

576
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,859
I'm shooting towards that goal there are
plenty

577
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:17,660
love educations please particularly you
know

578
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,879
I'm New York City cutie we need teachers

579
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,750
if many teachers desperate to higher
levels to help kids

580
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:28,250
move on so they're planning areas

581
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,700
that your to be a teacher in even public
school

582
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,600
you have to have a DS join the
fellowship get your masters

583
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:39,049
will help you pay for get your asses
then go on from there

584
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:43,820
you have to teach US government has same
policy work for the EPA for into the

585
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,890
environment or

586
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,640
ariel's have gone to several career
that's where

587
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,100
you don't have to work for I hate to say
the Marine Corps

588
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,250
army always looking for computer people
but they're

589
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:59,980
other civilian operations a civilian
facilities as you can move onto

590
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,700
with higher degree even with the BS
they'll pay for you to get your masters

591
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,339
and PhD

592
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:08,660
so there our opportunities you just have
to know where to look

593
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:11,899
and that be afraid now

594
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,570
changing Main Street that's something I
just recently left a job

595
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:20,380
your criteria hospital where %uh lesson
for me was

596
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:25,580
is I think my knowledge to certain
technology got way

597
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:28,930
and I words

598
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,660
asked to leave subtly mmm because I
could not

599
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:36,350
deal with the people in management

600
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,450
that's why so many issues had no problem
technology

601
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,820
but I him managers basically

602
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,940
and sometimes they let that shit so do
you have any suggestions for

603
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:50,430
melding year see that seems to be the
issue

604
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,040
for people with you know who are
intelligent

605
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,270
know the technology but can't deal with
people who

606
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,230
tell you what to do oh this yes X that's
awful

607
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,480
Yes No really good management people can
be a lot more

608
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,160
cooperative and you feel like you have a
stake in things and it's not a

609
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,580
pushy hierarchical threatening system

610
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,950
yeah I down I don't know what to do
about bad management and

611
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:21,820
I do know that some hackers don't have
the greatest social skills &

612
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:28,430
sometimes show their displeasure with
with people and less than friendly ways

613
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,730
it is hard to inhibit one's impulses at
times

614
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,869
had it can be a real job saver

615
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,359
yes I'm you touched on economics

616
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,000
I would definitely agree with you in
finding it someone

617
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,609
disrespectful to like the harder science
is in some respects and it's not being

618
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:47,880
very

619
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,290
rigors but a a guess my question is
ultimately

620
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,560
would you consider hacker mentality
selfish mentality

621
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,940
in comparison to people working in
economics who are

622
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:03,339
what's a trying to enact social policy
to improve people's lives

623
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:07,130
you consider hackers in their pursuit to
be selfish pursuits

624
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,000
whereas maybe people working economics
and that kinda field

625
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,330
on even though they might not know what
they're doing

626
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:19,779
perhaps they're trying for a more

627
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:24,160
just a a goal for the common good verses
yeah they certainly are ahead

628
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,080
econ professors tell me how sad the way
that they've been losing their best

629
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,150
students to hedge funds and how

630
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,510
to be in academia it's like to be in a
priesthood where you have to forego all

631
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,839
this money you know it's not like an
English where if you get a doctor

632
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:41,190
there's not a great deal you can do
they'll pay you 200 grams starting and

633
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,670
doubling

634
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,819
your you do a good job but ive PhD

635
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:48,240
and he con- if you get into the right
hedge funds pretty definite people

636
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,700
first yes

637
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,470
yeah I on well

638
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,640
I tend to think that people who agree
with me on economic issues are doing it

639
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,359
for the greater good in people who
disagree have a selfish

640
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:06,270
agenda so not the most objective person
out there

641
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:10,480
I am suspicious if some other more
extremist think tanks that take

642
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,720
really extreme ideas and try to present
them as if they are

643
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,080
mainstream or an alternative that's on
people putting

644
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,869
for example yes

645
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,700
yeah I wanted to know a little bit more
about you mention on the first areas was

646
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,310
journalism

647
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:29,660
and using our technical knowledge to

648
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,319
if we can go ahead and use it in ways
that can

649
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:37,869
help educate people so then how would
you how one get into that

650
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:41,619
you mention and that their our magazines
and newspapers always

651
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:45,550
under a deadline looking for stories and
things like that oh yeah

652
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,710
go ahead and how's your evening is going
to web sites and get go to the contact

653
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,470
page and find all the people who are in
charge

654
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,030
article say I can write you an article
on this here my qualifications do you

655
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,069
want and quite often must say

656
00:39:57,069 --> 00:40:00,230
well give it a go if it's terrible we
just want printed

657
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,339
an the easiest thing as the letter to
the editor because they have to get a

658
00:40:03,339 --> 00:40:04,380
bunch of those

659
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:08,770
on a regular basis so you you can get
hacker viewpoints into

660
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:12,859
newspapers magazines pretty easily but
thing with journalism

661
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:16,450
is that they can't afford to pay the
wages that a person with a really

662
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,940
technical background

663
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,740
would expect so it's the kind of thing
where you can do it for a little while

664
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,640
for the final better for the experience
but if you wanna make a career out of it

665
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,279
you have to have some scheme like

666
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,290
hyping some professor somewhere and then
Cooper in a book with pen

667
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:38,060
Yoona like that Freakonomics thing or
you can manufacture a story turn

668
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:41,460
someone into the FBI's most wanted
hacker to publish a book

669
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,460
with some guy here writing about

670
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,589
yeah thats yeah thinking on after
retirement so

671
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:55,089
yeah and the other lessons

672
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,540
flow don't know if this

673
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,839
if you're the best person to answer this
but

674
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,890
know for laws that you say maybe

675
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,118
the computer itself should be more
secure whatever infrastructure

676
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,050
whatever structure around it more secure

677
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,180
even though everyone in the mainstream
is affected by these laws

678
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:20,980
say did one in Copyright Act

679
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,049
you know the include that

680
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:27,190
ended up creating law in the government

681
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:31,089
to play everyone else was decidedly not
mainstream

682
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:34,310
yeah I was very lengthy well posse

683
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:38,529
how do or how would you propose

684
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:42,710
safe from the viewpoint less government
intrusion

685
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:46,720
to go about changing laws that are just
backed

686
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,510
you can wear I honestly don't know
because the people who write laws are

687
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,890
elected leaders generally and you
generally have to have a lottery and

688
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,250
then you have to spend your life

689
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,830
fundraising it it's really of a very you
can go

690
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,009
you know the political science libraries
and check out

691
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:07,410
books about just how much money a
congressman has to raise every week to

692
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,799
stay in office and help people
contribute to the guide

693
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:14,240
think they're gonna is gonna win so
that'll returned the favor said

694
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,280
it is vaguely corrupt I guess it

695
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,069
it's less corrupt than you know more
authoritarian regimes

696
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:25,700
it's frustrating because dedicating your
life to something like that is more than

697
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,890
most people want to do

698
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,540
as as far as we know this is your one
life so you might as well have a good

699
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,210
time

700
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:33,859
yeah I think educating

701
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:36,900
done masses making them less afraid

702
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,230
technology less afraid of ice

703
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:43,770
being patient with people so that they
associate hackers

704
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:47,750
with Thomas Edison and tinkerers rather
than

705
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,319
creeks to steal things from people are

706
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:55,529
write viruses and destroy things now

707
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:59,160
the iPod sort of exploded on the scene

708
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,069
as or even though it wasn't the first
mp3 player and

709
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:08,839
there wasn't too much discussion you
know which would constitute fair use

710
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:13,040
what's this what's this what's this and

711
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,569
you know you have by the letter of the
law

712
00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:19,650
many hundreds of thousands of felons

713
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,210
running around yeah that's frightening
when everyone in this country is guilty

714
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,250
of a felony

715
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,690
and probably hundreds of them that's a
very frightening prospect for selective

716
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:29,980
prosecution

717
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,470
but the market did force the issue over
what fair use

718
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,350
is and you know if the iPod didn't exist
we'd probably

719
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:42,000
would have less fair use available to us

720
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,950
not even from the perspective a fair use
by

721
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,619
DCSS case and

722
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,630
number other things but specifically
DCSS and

723
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:56,890
DMCA laws just the laws wrong

724
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:00,259
you can always wait for you know a jury
trial

725
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,010
hope there some sort of you know you can
educate them the get some sort of jury

726
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,010
nullification

727
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:09,350
yeah it's just it's so is this a
bald-faced there's no pretense that this

728
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,880
is done in the interest in anyone but
some

729
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,799
send industry group its very frustrating
to deal with that I think if

730
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:20,299
we could explain to enough people that
this really is

731
00:44:20,299 --> 00:44:23,520
corrupt them that they are losing their
public domain

732
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,350
you know that this extension have
copyright terms is not really providing

733
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:32,080
greater incentive and we know every
smack not the people discount future

734
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,680
value

735
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,160
things anyway right so you could make an
argument

736
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,430
that yeah I know I don't know that much
it's it's a very

737
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,480
frustrating world to try to deal with
and yummy

738
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,790
one person and a very good place but I
guess we have to change

739
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:52,529
people at the local level and try to do
the best we can

740
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:56,900
thank you

741
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,150
any others

742
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,800
okay well I'm already miss the fun
photography I hope that wasn't too

743
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:04,350
boring

744
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,020
bank
