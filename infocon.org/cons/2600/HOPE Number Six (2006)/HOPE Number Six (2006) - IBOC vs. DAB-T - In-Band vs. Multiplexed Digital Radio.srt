1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,839
videos tulika why we're going over XD is
a radio and many ways

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:08,880
there isn't much for prom with with FM
or or AM

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,190
you can listen to it since any on FM
generally

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,639
you know its goods is good audio people
happy a.m.

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,420
you know it can be a bit said the hizzy
batista radio

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,350
analyzes to reconstructs and the signal
so if there are any errors

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,660
which occur due to bad reception we can
then Eric Rick Timmons

8
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,990
fairly standard ways now and their full
what you're listening to see exactly

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,560
what they put into the transmitter

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:41,100
meaning you have got rid of all Agora
your section problems no more his

11
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,380
you know even on FM got a good signal in
the middle of a song

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,970
because quiets then you can hear the
hiss

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,239
I love you can often his I'm on the
signal

14
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,500
and so to give you that is actually
quite good idea

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,410
and if you can bring in any other a.m.
and Huntsman's like

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,530
am more bet you know better frequency

17
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,820
response and ask your plan producer
radio version of an increase in a matter

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,470
for

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,750
channels available and so a big push is
that the man is showing us

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,880
and also because the stage to you can
send extra day too long

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,960
saves for the channel name is rather
than just a

22
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,970
tuning into and in ninety two point six

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,170
help me find something so

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,750
%um to get diese radio you can look it
in very simple way

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,990
you need to compress the audio coming
into the studio you cough

26
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,470
am you know basically CD CD sound must
be better than that depending on how you

27
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,429
sampled it he said is true

28
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,220
is to just two day I have a essentially
2 megabits a.m.

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,340
second have audio in realistically con
transmit that so

30
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:52,640
a lossy compression has come in
somewhere nowadays

31
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,580
then 1 seed in that's you can combine it
with you next day to the song name is

32
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,920
i'm for the telephone number in traffic
reports and stuff like that to give them

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,619
as he can pick that up on your radio
ands

34
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,150
you need to believe signaling data to to
control the stream

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,840
and then US ticket on the on the
airwaves

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,870
with OFDM which can come in him to be a
sick Mb

37
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,010
by simple from that from that
perspective on the very high level

38
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,450
and so gonna look it's how exactly are
we going to do this

39
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,569
where we gonna put the data ones who got

40
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:33,480
I'm on day 2 ready to send you can use
the same frequencies

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,290
we gonna send of to some other
frequencies in band on Channel

42
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,749
is oh I boxer shorts is when

43
00:02:41,749 --> 00:02:45,809
you got your you got your FM station or
your AM station

44
00:02:45,809 --> 00:02:49,439
and you decide that's you gonna send
digital signal

45
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,180
on the same channel so you tune into
some forty

46
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,209
kilohertz and you can listen to analog
we can listen to did still

47
00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:00,840
whereas in many other pass the world

48
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,790
cited to do is was basically start again

49
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:08,999
have totally different frequency band
and then you can transmit your radio

50
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:12,719
there you have to worry about forwards
or backwards compatibility

51
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,769
UN load and where it was always been you
got you need it still

52
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:20,939
and one day when a disease and its to
use which of them police you reduce

53
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:22,799
demand for bandwidth to using

54
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,260
and have see that's a a good plans was
given to concerned cuz that then I'm

55
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,339
making less money by

56
00:03:28,339 --> 00:03:31,510
sending across the spectrum I am

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,209
but over here that's not what's a
decided to do

58
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,529
the SEC says it's Dan to broadcast

59
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:42,040
using iBooks so you sending the audio

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,358
are analog who along with their digital

61
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:49,249
this is one who

62
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:52,329
big reasons is that the new frequencies
which

63
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:56,629
we're using over in europe are already
allocated to the military here

64
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,389
and a unwilling to share them and
surprisingly so

65
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:03,659
that that's one reason why you can use
that

66
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,879
l-band which is a high frequency range
and so

67
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:11,239
that's why and that's why I books

68
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,439
become popular here but also stations
were concerned about losing their

69
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,099
branding

70
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,370
if you if you base everything around fat
the O

71
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,600
to bzzz on 740 and you use that for
years and years

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,070
then it can be an issue in the changing
over HD Radio

73
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,990
is the name what's been selected here

74
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,470
i block is simply an idea away going
about things

75
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,340
you it's just simply saying that you are
using the same channel

76
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,540
22 sensitive signals HD Radio

77
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,710
is a trademark all I B Chrissy

78
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,010
whose company that second within and

79
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,920
that is specifically and that sets out
the whole

80
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,890
and nature of how the that's two radio
signals but together

81
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,969
so you can have also two different I saw
my book but

82
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,220
from you gotta go with AC radio here if
you wanna listen to it

83
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,090
its AC radio is entry is enshrined now
in some standards

84
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,680
by an arrest c5a the national radio
systems committee

85
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,780
it's known standards in that setting out
exactly how to frame your data

86
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,650
I'm but notably it doesn't mention

87
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,600
which is mentioned it didn't suspect by
the Kodak is needed

88
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,580
within the standards the audio codec use
for the compression

89
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,859
and is not explains and that's because

90
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,150
its a proprietary codecs I'm owned by IB
perceives the company

91
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,420
that second with AC radio that I think
they've got

92
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,430
said 50 to pay dues against it and a
surge

93
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:53,360
and mystery secret this means thats

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,360
the whole of and AC radio and is relying
upon this proprietary codecs

95
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,040
the HD incidentally in HD Radio
apparently doesn't send high-definition

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:11,610
many people would refer to it as such
but both CEO & Marketing Manager

97
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,570
have have come and said nice txt sends
for HD

98
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,349
well and the mock me mike d notice that
XD sense for nothing

99
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:23,890
a which is intriguing Clear Channel and
MPI

100
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,680
and all that am big plays are backing HD
Radio nobody

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,320
and said that make sense obvious am
going to go on and say

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,560
do good things and bad things by Jace
media but essentially the FCC's chosen

103
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,140
to go with the in band

104
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,219
and inventions missions and you gotta

105
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,600
that's already limiting what you can do
and so release to say no is Mitch's

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,150
you know I may criticize AC radio the
fact that

107
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,639
Clear Channel and MP on many other
people behind it

108
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,610
is just showing that they're realizing
that you know this is we're gonna get

109
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,650
food in them

110
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,670
and stately one thing

111
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,370
as I just gonna play sample Ave C rated
directly from the website

112
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:10,870
jazz/nu AM radio are you tired of
listening to these

113
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,990
this is big see themselves this

114
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,389
you an example I am right now

115
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,720
it sound like and nations you can hear
this

116
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,910
a lot more frequencies but I knew
exactly the kind of

117
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,560
I think they with creative thinking it's
and typically used

118
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,080
with a yes life 12 and I'm

119
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,039
to send by you

120
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,040
you're going to love age you want a
licence

121
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,950
or this West

122
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,090
obviously having come from their website
and

123
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,400
they've I'm so as well produced but

124
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,110
it does them it is shown to have a bias
though that bad

125
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:18,139
stick to some poise it is a specific for
I am the tasty radiators

126
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:22,020
allow I am and like to hear a lot more

127
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,610
Modio the a.m. as a setting the

128
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,220
the the month ago 15 or 20 kilohertz
which is little more than normal

129
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,589
and safer a.m. it is certainly mean that
you can it's a lot more like listening

130
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:34,870
to 90 min FM

131
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,019
the whole go live in HD Radio is to

132
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,870
bring FM radio and up to new CD quality
standard

133
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,980
I'm and the idea of and

134
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,930
the enhancement a.m. is to bring it up
to approximately an FM standard

135
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,640
so removing the borrower the course that
means there for FM

136
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,160
radio stations is not always easy to
hear the difference

137
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,569
between the two samples I specifically
chose a in that because it is easy to

138
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,190
use for Chivas can system

139
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,850
I am it's quite obvious that this is a
benefit

140
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,570
and you know there are downsides the
they have

141
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,020
very have a little date is and to work
with

142
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,360
I'll accounts that ministry and so

143
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,450
let's just look at how it works to go
analog radio

144
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:25,550
I'm which sits in a.m. its map said Sen
kill her serve here

145
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:31,040
and that's that seem in a band which
could play with when you have analog

146
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,060
transmissions

147
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,700
most to the paths transmission and that
for most the information

148
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,750
is at the center the on the channel so

149
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,970
if you tune in some 40 then that's where
all the

150
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,180
the Paris even though you have tankers
band with

151
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,620
so the sides the the ages

152
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,949
of you allocated channel: not really
using

153
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:57,000
much that that this frequency to and

154
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,589
so they've they've used this idea

155
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,170
sconce this icy and the visa sided

156
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,680
of on the outsides not using much to the
the band with

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,060
to put the the diesel am

158
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,790
its to put the digital information on
outside an issue this is an FM

159
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,589
this is not an example triangle in the
middle is a is the normal an organ

160
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:23,829
the sites because it is still a.m.

161
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,550
and so is so being at the sides is
doesn't really interfere much with the

162
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,560
original signal

163
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,130
if M

164
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,660
this is what we call hybrid mode where
you on a

165
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,060
putting the two together AC made has
capability to go completely digital

166
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:46,459
and you switch off analog am totally now
see that frees up more space to use them

167
00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:49,640
for the destruction putting the

168
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,720
and but he ditched on the insides a.m.
gives you

169
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,670
balan FM is about 96 kilobits per second
and

170
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,740
for and I am it's around 30 to 36

171
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,760
it all depends on how you how you use is
and retraction things that

172
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,680
so as you can see snow may mix play with
I am

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,980
say I remember in the early days you
know mp3's

174
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,930
in Jan 28 killed second standard bit
dodgy has come on down

175
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,300
and them no it is not you know and
that's improved

176
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,890
its it's it's a it's enough to get Sam

177
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,100
as demand for bandwidth is enough

178
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,760
to get some decent so close she sent on
their bed being such a low bitrates

179
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,000
there's obviously a lot I've replication

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,850
and not faxes come through the

181
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:45,779
the whole idea of putting game of
putting digit and is still information

182
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,270
the sides have to carry a

183
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,870
am is a good one although in a and
they've for

184
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,949
they've chosen to put its I'm a bit

185
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:57,839
beyond the regional channel as a
potential hurts um

186
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,420
band with but they've actually increase
that and so %um

187
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,699
it will overspill up to would

188
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:07,860
they've these in 15 kill her split a
minus-15 killers

189
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,170
which means this if you if you're
listening to

190
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,040
them a and I radio station

191
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,730
and then NHA and then is 11 the next we
could see

192
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:22,329
which is using digital the neck in its
favor accounts station

193
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,829
will come unto them group 51 is now the
sample

194
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:32,760
a.m. our plane a moment this 1i believe

195
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,130
Space PC driving through Lincoln Tunnel
and

196
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,680
the idea is that in the tunnel you gots
and

197
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,920
leaky coaxial system which is

198
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,400
a the cable which you put your not your
radio signal down

199
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,699
and you specifically make it not very
good cable

200
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:53,000
so that the signal leaks out and you can
but then you turn on

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,020
maintain a.m. radio while you're driving
through the

202
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,740
the central and that's not as good as
the known I am

203
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,180
and soon this this particular a.m.

204
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,189
sample what you hear is a person driving
through the tunnel

205
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:10,180
listening to the time the tunnel vision
AM radio

206
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,770
in the command eternal you can hear an
improvement in the sound is a cam

207
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:16,860
start listening to AM normal way

208
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,990
and then you hear the AC make a kick in
and

209
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,559
Celis now for those that transitions
driven

210
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:30,559
51 in hi

211
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,249
and now four till nine o'clock on this
Friday morning

212
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,440
with the mark

213
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,030
and welcome again did 40 sold

214
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,560
for job of course George here for
another

215
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,600
big our and then I'll be back tomorrow
morning with closer with so I think all

216
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,860
those said transitions to a fairly
obvious

217
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,720
I am and so you can you can you can hear
that it's

218
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,740
it is actually am helping in the

219
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,210
the 8am HD Radio does actually sound if
any good

220
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:05,590
in comparison on it it's on our GM which
is

221
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,760
orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing its its

222
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,790
said essentially am a really good way
own fam

223
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,160
getting they see from ways and one place
to the other is used in ADSL

224
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm but it is also used am over-the-air
full

225
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,550
dish to channels by from TV and radio

226
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,680
um all over the world hola low point is
this:

227
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,860
if you got served under Section however
could you section is there will be some

228
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:34,620
impairment

229
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,290
Anna said she don't put your whole lamb
the whole lotta data

230
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,240
on on one channel I'm on one carry
because

231
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,670
if some like it's corrupted and then you
lose a lot

232
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,990
the idea here is you have lots to them

233
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,700
small carriers at thousands have an
individual signals

234
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,270
which is sending data quite a low
bitrate: because total together

235
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,920
that is a significant mandates and so if
you lose

236
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,600
wanna to those and carries the signals
then you've only lost a few bits data

237
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,310
and if you then before use if you then

238
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,570
scramble you dated before you send it
and to make its way to a random

239
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,570
and in to leave it so that you in

240
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,950
instead of sending bits 1,2,3,4,5 use

241
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,860
you send its full and Mac cheese and six
in like canister

242
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,870
you then when you come to recruit
recreate reassemble your day to the

243
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,450
other end

244
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,790
and he's neem problems which have
affected

245
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,689
and thats any the channels they're
distributed

246
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,520
throughout the day to any smaller gaps
and a retraction could cope small gaps

247
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,520
if you had a long gap then that be a
problem

248
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,850
his new is a kinda example you get the
idea of

249
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,380
three frequency am this lawsuit for

250
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,200
by small carries and so that they will
total together

251
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,790
am I think

252
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,329
Anna I think I C values and three
injured

253
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:10,330
these have a small carries I'll just

254
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,450
going through section issues we

255
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,480
I was mentioning earlier about Sam

256
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,650
the problem adjacent channels and this
is particularly boots on and at night

257
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,900
and above it's quite popular

258
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,190
to listen to chat to radio stations
which aunt in your local area

259
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,690
am essentially few near enough to
another city

260
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,260
and pecan can W choices radio stations

261
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,189
so often you have something that's a
half and had the example is said to be

262
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,670
why why I'm 740

263
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,820
I'm kilohertz then no be a gap in your
local

264
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,860
radio and then perhaps 7 760 you have
another

265
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,440
station and you listen to those but in
tonight's

266
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,190
the properties them speech change in you
can actually receive

267
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,920
have a different for the way am that's
that's called skyway for

268
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,720
skyway for publication because you no
longer getting it directly from the

269
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,790
transmissive is gonna

270
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,800
and passing down and all is said and
then

271
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,448
you can then you get one on some 50
which is in the middle you two channels

272
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:21,310
and and so that's fine you can listen to

273
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,909
and the station some fifty and as long
as you

274
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,260
you know you've got good enough
reception competitive with their a few

275
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,950
whistles and bells

276
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,179
fading and which a lot of people do then

277
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,770
thats that's good but unfortunately if

278
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:39,160
failure local stations using and HD
Radio

279
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,250
then all the ditch to noise essentially

280
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,650
that is putting out and will and she go
over the

281
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,150
the channel seven fifty you wanna listen
to I'm coming from

282
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,580
long distance away so that's why you
them

283
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,490
HD Radio is not committed to be used on
a and comely

284
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,520
I am during the nighttime and

285
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,780
all stations switch it off I think it's
a SM

286
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,300
am I've gots an example now all

287
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,210
up the interference says to take a quick
listen to them

288
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,550
first

289
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,678
what should be an easy Captain William
firepower

290
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,750
here except when K 250 miles away in

291
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,320
Denver on six 30 is operating

292
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,830
iPod here's 640 at 603 Pia

293
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,830
five seconds into this recording you'll
hear the I box which of

294
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:42,830
in Denver

295
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,059
660 should be pretty good here were
about 250 miles from the 50 kilowatt

296
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:57,168
hour in window rock

297
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,100
this time we're listening as 670

298
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,260
Denver first adjacent shuts off its

299
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:11,260
by Bach here is 660

300
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,870
and she can hear the initially

301
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,350
basically is just white noise and quite
loud when was actually I'm

302
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,700
which can totally obliterates any not
even long distance

303
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,970
radio stations am and so that's that and
that is a big problem

304
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,909
to look West side because it was another
example i Bach is that noise it adds to

305
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:45,010
the iBook stations

306
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:48,270
own main channel and that noise level

307
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,600
is added to what once might have been a
very quiet

308
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,850
analog signal depends on how well both

309
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:59,230
the station's side bands match anything
disturbing

310
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,440
the linearity up the station's reception
will add

311
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,370
noise to the main signal key always a
very well engineered station

312
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,860
everything leaves the tower in a linear
fashion but propagation

313
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,179
can mess up the signal and if it isn't
linear when it gets to the receiver

314
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,669
wide by Bach actually degrades the
manger

315
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:23,419
listen to the yes level from my book
change

316
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:28,470
with typical variations in reception
condition were monitoring k away

317
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:31,799
you're not the actual station audio
doesn't change

318
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,799
only his level in relation to the voice

319
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,690
cableway during daytime iPod they hear
us

320
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,210
generated by the digital signal the
Pentagon has been involved in domestic

321
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,289
law enforcement indeed defense

322
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:53,370
officials continue to stress that they
intend for the troops to play a largely

323
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,450
supporting

324
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,299
role in homeland emergencies but the new
plans provide with several senior

325
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:03,139
officers acknowledges the likelihood the
military will have to take charge

326
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:08,480
in my estimation

327
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,920
fifty-state the Department of Defense is
best positioned

328
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:15,960
and we'll take the lead said

329
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,460
one I just want social drafted the
military

330
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:24,000
divided so you can hear the Sam those
commutes play an essential even on the

331
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,690
same channel

332
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,130
missing analog he started here the ditch
to creep in

333
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,050
now no this is this is mainly but not
exclusively a problem

334
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:36,680
now on AIM and it is problem when you're
listening to analog

335
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,160
so theoretically in future and when

336
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,070
stations and don'ts broadcast in analog
all

337
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,320
least if they do bukas na whenever he's
listening to HD

338
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,200
these problems go away and now and
certainly when they when they turn off

339
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,770
their

340
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,000
and look transmit transmissions then I'm
then and this this is no longer too much

341
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,840
for an issue anymore

342
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,439
I am I just got served got another
receptions sample he initially

343
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:11,380
no I don't

344
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,950
and that was complacency a.m.

345
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:19,230
so let's have a look at work the the
options elsewhere

346
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,910
and Dabu so too could you go on for
seven

347
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,690
is them is the system that we use in

348
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,240
in Europe in the UK a.m. which uses love
the

349
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,530
soon similar techniques am in japan
they've chosen and another system code

350
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,780
dynasty be

351
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,660
I'm that is basically the same is that
the European system but they've

352
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,240
they've built on top of it am more
ability to send different types if

353
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,250
I love them 0 data

354
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:52,390
is so stupid is not just a major can be
TV

355
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:56,880
and and indeed to IP traffic DRM

356
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,740
is a another vision all fam using
similar techniques to

357
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,240
both AC radio and and AB which will talk
when a moment

358
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,350
DRM is a.m. is an iBook method

359
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,360
all sending data but is not compatible
with analog

360
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,220
am and so that's and that's why it's not
been chosen here because

361
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,880
obviously that would mean setting a new
new frequencies old

362
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,560
reallocating space umbo did you
broadcast

363
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,620
I'm so you could look into Dabi against

364
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,490
try calling you recall 47 cos DA be in
Houston school digital audio

365
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,350
broadcasting

366
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,720
serious essentially say it could easily
be am

367
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,280
description if hd-ready am

368
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,790
sage broadcaster high frequencies them

369
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,379
either it's a run into some to make a
solar rem

370
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,280
1.4 gigs I am the the idea is the CLECs

371
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,990
when Lohse stations together and in you
you send them out as as a stream

372
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:01,420
ups 2 megabits a.m. so you then tune
into

373
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,000
one one consentual frequency and you
down on them

374
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,230
specs you think it semtex 10 channels is
something you need to select them by

375
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,740
name

376
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,650
I was pretty good system and you can
have national regional multiplexes

377
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,910
I am I guess and perhaps it would be a
an international

378
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,110
most blacks am here if it were enacted
because at the

379
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:25,890
large area that's so you have to cover
the great thing about it is that

380
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,230
it can be a single frequency network
because that the is

381
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,950
because the safeguards built in to DA be
and

382
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,460
you can have a single frequency network
where lot two different transmitted

383
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,470
through broadcasting

384
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,980
the same signal bone else on the same
frequency which econ have

385
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,640
with FM because will interfere I am

386
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,920
and so you know that that's that's
proven no quite popular in

387
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,590
in Europe a

388
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:57,720
who just Havlik over here

389
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,390
just talking about Ben diseases and I'm
orthogonal frequency division

390
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:03,440
multiplexing so the same techniques

391
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,330
spacing up and you a Taser sending its
am

392
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,679
on those two different carries its Sam

393
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,630
out I'll just go into the advantages my
book

394
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,790
because it is a good thing is you know
plainly a.m.

395
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,659
it to it improves a H a.m. section

396
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,390
I am and also next took by this towards
the end for community radio

397
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,000
it doesn't have any big barriers the
problem with the AP a.m.

398
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,900
is that you have see cooperates and one
company essentially owns

399
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,720
the multiplex and then you go to the
company paid them and then they say okay

400
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,210
you can come on and Wu

401
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,440
will put you into the bundle and will
transmit you and so this is a big

402
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,230
barrier for community radio

403
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,370
and say each the station connect
independently do

404
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,530
and do what they want a.m.

405
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:58,710
it's a SSA and on AMC it's a good says a
good plan

406
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,120
and also a.m. on FM the the great thing
about putting

407
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,740
game about going digital is you don't
have to use all the

408
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,230
will be a band with for once station you
can then

409
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,310
split up that's and data and transmit
more than one station

410
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:17,780
I'm and eyes that's very important

411
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,270
looking at it from a listen this point
of view what's why would I going out and

412
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,600
buying radio

413
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,000
a.m. initially relatively expensive
least

414
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,360
102 23 into dollars and obviously that
will come down

415
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,540
butts the thing I see is is a consumer

416
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,760
is going to manage choice that's easy
thing for me to see

417
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,980
see you can put them in a box and so run

418
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,300
using this radio in in the UK we've
managed to double him and if

419
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,850
stations you can listen see and so you
know you

420
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,720
that that's a big selling points and i
think thats significant driving factor

421
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,730
just to say better quality and a it's
it's quite hard for people to judge

422
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,400
in AM situation yes it's good policy but
on the other hand

423
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,380
and that you know there are problems is
it is quite large factor in this purview

424
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,580
hard to hear but it's because ive them

425
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,510
because the ways reconstruction
available bitrate: and

426
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,470
its you know it is it is a bit in the
harsh signal to listen to

427
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,530
and I'm not sure how long people you
know into a listening to it

428
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:24,200
and whether they prefer the old analog
a.m. just because

429
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,220
that have allowed its large banks in
there and so

430
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,050
begin a quality is MC very hard to am
took power and

431
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,250
to rate and say I think that's a
secondary drive in fact

432
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,940
for buying things I'd ABC Radio am

433
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,300
its importance to be able to have more
choice

434
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,910
from listeners point of view because
know that does he give them

435
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,930
essentially the you can i guess im more
most aces

436
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,140
you can 12 listen to but also from the
the broadcast his point of view

437
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,980
and keeping up with the changing way the
media is

438
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,690
and is going in you one has to find
different advertising streams

439
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,200
conventional advertising is

440
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,480
you know Israel reducing and so having
another seconds

441
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,890
a.m. radio station I'm which needn't be
very expensive

442
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,260
to set up because I've seen you you
gotta love it sorted already

443
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,129
and initially a.m. in in in the UK love
the extra stations were

444
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,500
essentially just computers playing at
least

445
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,420
have stuff known and there are many
stations was just do that

446
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,570
and by the point being they didn't have
am the match

447
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,080
bush track stuff there wasn't much and
DJM potential

448
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,990
and so you can create you know an
acceptable an OK

449
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,060
and seconds to remove music who knew

450
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,210
or other things and then the move more
people get into it more people listen

451
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,900
the bedroom be the No for more details
on their and so you know that that is a

452
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,640
way

453
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,950
and who the radio stations to get into
that

454
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:58,070
and so %um something that's why choice
is important

455
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,689
am on both sides to the equation

456
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,380
and a put down here like a bad press is
is important I think

457
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,100
that the problem is am once you start
saying you CD quality Sentinel I kinda

458
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,670
stuff

459
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,860
and you know you can see you in the
water

460
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:18,050
the is obviously not CD quality sound am
because you don't have

461
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,919
you don't compress CDs and down to use
96 kilobits per second and listen to

462
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,650
them

463
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,680
a.m. and so when they advertise that bad
it's very dangerous because

464
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,140
you know a lying be people catch on

465
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,260
and then vending would have math gets
round

466
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,180
and you know it doesn't kill technology
burt's you know you gotta try keep away

467
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,720
from

468
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,550
that kinda bad press and then and
cynicism

469
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,050
a bouncer taking you know so I mean that

470
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,690
leads me into Canada the the straps

471
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,680
disarray do. the knots imagehipa
certainly in the UK where you have this

472
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:59,450
big would have to make this seconds

473
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,360
a savory we can have like 2000 then
channels

474
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,570
below the lowest quality imaginable and
so

475
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:10,120
you do people get very broadcast give
excited when they say are you can just

476
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,960
add another channel in real easily

477
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,030
and and sis and extend here you can I
think I have

478
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,100
firm you can you can have two threes

479
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,530
stations if you go all-digital I'm using
AC radio

480
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:27,620
birds that comes with it the price and
the price is seen at the Coliseum

481
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,830
you get in the UK we have them
guidelines and minimum bit rates the you

482
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,659
allowed

483
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,730
and film music in the speech am

484
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,950
which the beer and some typically X is
different codec

485
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:42,560
I'm be going to be very careful to not
compromised

486
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,399
quality too much essentially no you just
turned on the qualities much as you can

487
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:46,840
to be

488
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,030
complainant and the little bit riches
this is the way that broadcasters

489
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,710
do sometimes approach this am

490
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:58,480
so that Cena that's going to be an issue
now be interested to see

491
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,100
how people react to they steal radio

492
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,910
and as I say not listen to billion I am
radio in

493
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,370
because the way they've you there
reconstitute the signal

494
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,580
from thirty cubits it is known

495
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:16,610
it is great to listen to and for through
point of view and I'm

496
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,450
man I'm not sure when that will you mind
gets tied

497
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,580
listening to you too bad or do you know
it's not something in the EU

498
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,189
something you really notice not saying
the EU defines

499
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,490
appalling is therefore switch it off but
you know can you listen to five hours

500
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:35,090
and I mean if is to reduce it station
can you listen to long

501
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,850
oh you know you gonna wants to know if
sooner or later

502
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,230
I'm in May may not change anything but I
beach then just

503
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,550
to see how people react to and its okay
Lex

504
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:50,770
I am so I just took about this
corporates

505
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:55,700
a ownership it seems sings bit strange
to me to %um

506
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,400
essentially be putting nation's
broadcasting

507
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,760
into the hands a one company I am

508
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,650
you know in a sense the other similar
things happening all over the place

509
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,450
we in the UK you could say that we only
have one one choices

510
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,980
have satellite TV which is owned by Fox
now owned by rupert murdoch rather

511
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,350
and then so you know you can release
which provided you either get

512
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,050
just random ones from different
satellites or you guess

513
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,210
Sky TV am and so you know

514
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,740
but we can we have other ways getting on
a ram

515
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,320
am getting a broke ass to hear because

516
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,870
because HTC which is the code excused
and for HD Radio because thats

517
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:41,160
and a you have to pay a license fee for
that ass and sensually

518
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,190
ECAT have to pay money to a big city am

519
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:48,200
and simply those who this is said it
cost

520
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,560
and some is everybody is is constantly
just paying many see them

521
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,679
which now is not such a bad idea but
know what

522
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,160
what if they decide they am they are
gonna license

523
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,270
and somebody side

524
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:07,290
I'm not is more theoretical thing is not
exactly like likely

525
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:11,110
but didn't know this it is it is
significantly possible

526
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,280
thats they could just say no we're not
going licensee for whatever reason and

527
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,129
then loosen that station come on the
broadcast

528
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,940
am in HD and there now so big deal

529
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,310
you can broadcast in HD in in the future
the whole

530
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,790
theory is that everybody will listen
using AC radios

531
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,620
so be nice and cheap am and is going to
take a long time to replace the 512

532
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,440
million radios in the US

533
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,470
butts and you know these things will
will progress

534
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:42,070
and so it just seems that they have fun
love

535
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,159
them you know power in the market

536
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,310
and you know the things I DMCA becomes

537
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:52,830
a.m. you can't Kevin no workaround this

538
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:58,400
and necessarily I'm do it also means
that because they're protecting its

539
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,830
city currently the rounds there isn't
really any choice you have to have the

540
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,960
radio receivers the they made

541
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,480
I am now I'm well aware that you know
we've

542
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,500
we've left the good old days when you
can get a fuel components sticking

543
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,320
together

544
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,320
analysts and you can I am receiver an

545
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,610
obviously footage to radio and is to
achieve you wanna that's no

546
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:22,910
that's not gonna work you gonna have to
come up with something a bit

547
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:26,319
a bit more than ample more effort into
it a.m.

548
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,000
but the point being the econ without the
when that information about the Kodak

549
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,020
essentially economists and to the radio
in

550
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,909
Yukon's create other applications and
other ways to use the

551
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,879
the radio an

552
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,890
community radio is am ceases

553
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:48,580
significant and them and i know im
low-power FM this country is

554
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:53,069
them gaining a little bit ground am

555
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,169
nope let a.m. community radio is

556
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,339
is to some extent and affected by this
Anna

557
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,720
the whole problem love the call for
ownership of

558
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,410
the system I'm because you don't have

559
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,549
the big multiplex provider and you have
to go up to them

560
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,850
might do in Europe and say I'd like to
broadcast me and they say will not be

561
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:17,390
I seventy-five thousand dollars please
the year a.m.

562
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:20,950
thats MC that's a big various community
radio

563
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,359
where is least here i'm just still on
the same channel and so is always you

564
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,110
can get the equipment start with

565
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,690
you can is to broadcast I am

566
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:33,820
but the course and you got the extra
cost of

567
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,200
and paying your fees I'm so I think she
said thats

568
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,370
you know that's another barrier I've
which is set with an extra may come in

569
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,270
as a mixture

570
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:47,350
is and an interesting

571
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:51,240
system which is compatible with HD
radios

572
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,790
in hybrid mode and that means that it's

573
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,840
if you station to size to go all HD

574
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,180
then you have an extra receiver won't
work but the idea behind a mixture is

575
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,160
Sen

576
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,819
if you buy an FM X receiver you can
still listen to HD Radio

577
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,210
I am I think that's the idea its II
either way to them

578
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,120
a.m. earlier about it and Sam I'm 90%
sure exactly what this compatible with

579
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,190
HD Radio

580
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,830
specifically means but you if you want
to get it yet again FM

581
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,790
extra receiver and the so when it seems
that they fail they've paid full row the

582
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,779
royalties

583
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:29,070
and they've they've paid license to
decode

584
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:34,230
the HD radio as well for the you getting
mad for mixers uses a C-plus

585
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:38,070
on which is and well-known

586
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,730
will getting well known standards am DK
am codec

587
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,170
which can go to a low bitrates and am

588
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:49,540
and guess my pin basic policy and this

589
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:54,350
and say that essentially because they're
using open code and Kodak

590
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:58,170
that's a good thing you don't have the
ongoing fees to advocacy

591
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,480
I'm but a course you know it's and

592
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,000
is quite risky coming onto the market
with them with FM extra stuff because

593
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,940
if everybody goes Sam HD Radio then then
I mean listen to your station

594
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,010
and they have managed to get maiti
stations on board am

595
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:17,090
so far which no is not many

596
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:21,530
I think only for HD Radio self
thereabouts and made hundreds

597
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,650
and stations in the US licensed to to
broadcast

598
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:30,870
and so I like the idea of an extra and
it is a sin things to HD Radio

599
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,980
but unfortunately am I'm not
particularly sure that it's gonna catch

600
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,080
on

601
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:41,029
because anagrams behind HD Radio

602
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,210
a.m. so looking looking four little bits

603
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,160
a.m. is there going to be an unlock
switch off well I'm 90% sure

604
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,640
I'm there they will be a long way off

605
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,970
am and I'll be interested to see where
the people decide and

606
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,600
to switch off analogue radio

607
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,490
in the in the UK the idea is that we we
are going to switch off and the radio

608
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,790
but Cena and then then set of them
partial almost

609
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:09,120
band but obviously this is little point
to do not hear

610
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,390
because them use documents and
frequencies just

611
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,560
just broadcasting in these two and

612
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,370
and so whether ICM that's the whole
thing will take off enough

613
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:24,560
and you will and people will therefore
once

614
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,730
the full ranges HD audio and the
enhanced bitrate: the

615
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,550
get when you drop the and no carrier

616
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,820
a.m. and fro love said about you know
the codec and how good it sends in

617
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,890
all or bad depending on how you put it

618
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:45,100
Anna as a saner mp3's

619
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,220
have have changed even though the
standard hasn't essentially

620
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,160
I think it's just the way that people
have learned how to actually in code

621
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,819
the data within the framework has been
set down has changed

622
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,790
and Sam and is also pre processes for HD
Radio already

623
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,900
which I'm claims you can modify the
audio to now before I guess

624
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,890
compressed to reduce artifacts which
come afterwards

625
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,810
and so suggesting the the same quality
in that respect will get better because

626
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,320
know people will learn how to to do with
them

627
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,320
an a mixture may or may not be a.m.

628
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,530
significance i am. bits

629
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:28,820
the in addition to just a more defined
the way the

630
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,880
you would you into the codec
theoretically I B

631
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,950
she could change their am to change the
codec I don't know how much for XP to

632
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,600
the is

633
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,580
buxom if they decided to change in any
way to prove it

634
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:46,029
then that would probably require new
radio says seems to be unlikely

635
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,270
a.m. I will and their and

636
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:56,270
if you have any questions helped and
them

637
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,550
hmm

638
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,630
you and use my place

639
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,720
well yeah it is on

640
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,600
love it i was just wondering how many

641
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,130
existing many HD stations these would
you say would fit into

642
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,430
on existing you know frequency

643
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:28,440
I meant to say your average FM station
I'm

644
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,840
believe these his room full I'm about 3

645
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,080
think within the framework so I mean
compared to say

646
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,799
satellite provider efficient to order

647
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,160
if they yet I mean this this whole thing

648
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,240
is is partly keep am stations
competitive

649
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,520
to increase their choice and Sandy

650
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,910
you know the same quality to try and to
try and stop people going over

651
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,649
excess to satellite radio I am but yeah
I mean obviously that is

652
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,650
there's no way that they can compete
simply on on the number

653
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,310
a state if stations I'm so

654
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:08,420
be a is good to the wee small choice but
you're looking its I'm

655
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,980
you know tripling the maps available
thank you

656
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:16,340
hi

657
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,490
I come from a group that the represents
I'll low-power radio stations from his

658
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,260
radio project

659
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,420
and we've commented before the SEC on

660
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,280
on the whole digital transition issue
and my other things that that we've set

661
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,820
about it

662
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,760
is that what we end up where then

663
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,530
and a conversion to digital is is a band
with windfall because you can actually

664
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,030
can get more

665
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:41,710
are more stations out love

666
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:44,110
roughly the same out the band with
actually they're going a little bit

667
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,720
further

668
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,930
than they used to be able to go and arm

669
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:51,960
while we think is sort of ridiculous and
the whole thing is that there are

670
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,720
thousands a group from the united states
have applied for radio stations that all

671
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,050
know you can have any

672
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,330
there's no room for you just at the very
same moment that

673
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:05,049
that your NPR and and comments are
actually able to put second and third

674
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,520
channels on their so what we asked for
was some

675
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,920
for some public interest obligations
where I'll

676
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,120
where the that new the new streams could
go to some other groups that applied for

677
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,520
low-power stations of community radio
stations

678
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,460
arm in the next three or four weeks the
SEC is probably going to you

679
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,540
approve a second level love

680
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,610
are about for his Asian for digital
radio on so I just want a

681
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:35,680
encouraged anyone that that interest in
this it's been

682
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,609
on hold for a long time at the FTC but
if there are things that you think

683
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:40,660
should be

684
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,040
in the in in in the future you know

685
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:47,580
in connection with the analogue
switch-off they're trying to

686
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,560
I bar I deputy right now is trying very
hard

687
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,670
to slip this one and make sure that no
additional

688
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:58,740
conditions are imposed on them and that
no new entrants can get into

689
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,600
HD radio in any way and sell an
important time to call

690
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,060
commissioners if you have ideas because
right now they're thinking that the only

691
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,610
voice on this is really the boys have
industry which

692
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,610
just want them to to do have things back
to the way that they

693
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,030
not that they get to keep although all
the channels for themselves

694
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:20,220
yeah okay thank that I mean it is worth
remembering that you know this is

695
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,120
and as is the distal radius when the
world it's

696
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,190
you know it's its in its infancy and you
know things can be changed and commented

697
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:28,560
upon

698
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,710
I get to a brief comments into

699
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,330
brief questions %uh the first one is the
US is already committed

700
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,400
to transitioning over the analog

701
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,130
TV airwaves to into additional thing so
we may learn some lessons from that

702
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:45,030
transition

703
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:50,160
maybe down the road we can fly to radio
we're subsidizing the end users

704
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,680
with set-top boxes right now you know
maybe we'll subsidize radio stuff

705
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:58,660
on that as far as I equity kinda being

706
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:03,960
the standard for this new HD Radio and
us being locked into a single vendor

707
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,350
got had protections and all the
technology patten's

708
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:11,339
due to expire for twenty years for the
most part and it

709
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:15,040
we I don't know what time frame we
looking after this transition

710
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,650
that may that may work itself out those
my 2 comments

711
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,130
my two questions for you on with

712
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,210
we've got a 10 killer heard gap on

713
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,940
a.m. signals right right and that's
because other

714
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:34,980
rocked the prague the properties have a
mini analog signals that they need

715
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,020
that's the to bleed over to the next
station

716
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,900
is is digital transmission does it kinda
eliminate

717
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,520
that that problem signal bleed over and
having this kind guard

718
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,640
spaces on either side channel on well
known and

719
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,770
in essence it you can view already uses
those in AM

720
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,090
because it goes it because it goes
beyond the 10 kill her switches

721
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:59,830
normally I'm allocated and up to fifteen

722
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,330
essentially is using them that gap

723
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:07,049
in no it doesn't it's probably more
robust wanna good things but diesel is

724
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:07,740
this

725
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:10,750
and you can you can actually

726
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,640
get its with good reception full least
is as far as I am

727
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:19,000
and its did Adams likens to so

728
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,720
and it should be resiliency to various
things in and save some mountains

729
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,210
hearings shouldn't necessarily be a
problem

730
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:31,560
but its yeah it will I'm you will you
need to keep those gaps in

731
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,710
inbox okay then the second quick
question was

732
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,450
this all completely different than gonna
spread spectrum technology correct

733
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,930
your site no frequency of DM

734
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,490
it's all completely different spread
spectrum approach

735
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,130
I am I think so 90% sure you mean

736
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:54,430
an unfamiliar with that idea spreads by
that name

737
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:57,899
like frequency hopping spread spectrum
direct taxes direct sequencing sprint

738
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,840
spectrum

739
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,090
on 0 that's fine okay might get it have

740
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,100
skokie 0 thanks

741
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,990
howdy and other so many FM stations

742
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,990
soul subcarriers cell

743
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:15,510
yeah bigger quotes rate so you got
things like a

744
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,800
for all hate well aware and loathing of
muzak

745
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,560
great supermarkets playing crappy music
that's that's coming off a

746
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,110
subcarrier or on services like um

747
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,190
you know people reading newspapers
foreign the blind

748
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:34,230
so love with with all this going on is
that gonna go away

749
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,360
and no it is a problem the

750
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,890
the the issue is am they will

751
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:45,730
essentially have to get within those
those things and commitment is to

752
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,370
and which is often can be a problem
seekers who semana receivers

753
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:53,290
and yeah it's a problem the they will
have to

754
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,940
get rid of those so carries for the most
part and

755
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,100
to something else thanks K is

756
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,970
you weren't discussing just just before
you I'll just continue on

757
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,300
the within within a and

758
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,600
HD Radio you can have day to serve
carries

759
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,990
and and you can actually get no for data

760
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:18,100
you can get some significant massive

761
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,730
information through and that's built
into into the whole thing

762
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,730
so United is certainly a possibility to
move to this occasion

763
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,500
to chew yes I'm so we've all been
talking about being locked in typically

764
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,420
do you know who

765
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,410
love any alternatives that are more for
lack of a better term

766
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,359
open source in terms of HD Radio was
there anything out there

767
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,090
obviously it seems certain locked in now
but has there been anything in the past

768
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,470
that was open

769
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,100
in terms of HW I'm when I think because
the same UI

770
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,200
down I'm not aware of any I'm on I'm
sure the the new

771
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,600
now will crop up on at the moment

772
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,690
it is is difficult on butts

773
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:01,560
a min hopefully and you be able to gets
into going with that we suffer ratings

774
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,930
to further

775
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,009
either um we've had a

776
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,330
HDTV for a while and wanna

777
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:13,799
technical merits was that you're allowed
to have and DVD's

778
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,810
as to where you can look at different
views are different channels

779
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,430
mines in China I haven't seen one uses
this yet

780
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,940
and it was supposed to be so they gon
you no one's ever ever used it

781
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,460
for even advertisements to put on
second-chance

782
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,280
it seems like the radios obviously don't
have the similar

783
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,900
as I mean it's easier to playlist radio
that is too close to TV

784
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,130
but my question is are they good causes
is the right strategy right now to

785
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,260
produce the van with

786
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:44,870
allocated stations and cram more n maybe
get even channel

787
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:48,589
FM's in there to it you know 2.2 and up
for

788
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:54,050
sales us right now as activists cram
more stations there and sold out

789
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:58,210
am with the idea is to put more stations
in but not necessarily competing

790
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,170
stations

791
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,230
am you know so you you have a second

792
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,770
radio station under the same brand and

793
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,690
but yeah I mean you raise an interesting
point their in new standards they're

794
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,930
always

795
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,890
later features and some uses and then

796
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,270
be interesting to see which switched am
which do

797
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:22,070
I am a Yemenite I think I think people
will use

798
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:25,910
the the second channels thing tomorrow
radio

799
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:28,920
project by NPR is is proactively M

800
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,580
using the X-two capacity available

801
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,930
and then yeah I think you will see that
but some

802
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,490
the those there will also be something
like the the multi

803
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:42,970
the multi-view thing in DVD's where no
people's them

804
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:46,190
using missin my time nasa thanks very
much for coming
