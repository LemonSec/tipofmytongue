1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:04,660
am number 113 for those of you who are
unaware

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,340
the theme for the weekend for hope
number six is based on

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,440
also program called the prisoner with
Patrick McGoohan as number six

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,560
the senior my talk this morning is

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,549
flash Sox for advertisers actually

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,880
flash sucks for consumers who cannot
download flash

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,790
advertisers haven't figured that out yet
and so they're still buying your

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,570
website's

9
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,930
and then say ok download flash or go
away

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,250
I hate that what see

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,990
the reasons I hate flash want to waste
my time

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:44,210
it really has content but i wanna see it
doesn't know I have graphics turned

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,420
of it takes for ever to download Flash
content if you haven't got the resources

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,320
and its public box always asks always
trust mega media content

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,770
maybe don't want to okay

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,310
it wastes my time

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,340
you only have download flash once but
they keep coming up with

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,350
new bloated versions and then

19
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,409
the flashing able Content takes forever
to load some people are still on dial-up

20
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:20,000
Sunday because people have figured out
yet he keeps moving the pictures above

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,510
my eye is naturally following it and
find it difficult to break away from it

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,530
a technique first used by MTV music
videos

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,140
I have never forgiven in TV for this not
a dial-up connection

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,729
it simply takes forever for a website to
start up

25
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,729
I'll let's you know

26
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,090
it really has content I want to see

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,090
I'm not looking for the number 31
Cingular Wireless Nextel Cup

28
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,659
chasing mighty Chevrolet Monte Carlo to
zoom around my screen

29
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:54,100
I want to reach Jeff Burton's by I want
to join his fan club

30
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,299
why are they wasting my time now you're
end is annoying enough

31
00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:02,409
as an animated Jeff now you're fucking
with flash

32
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,280
as well I use yahoo mail online why
can't you know me I have a preference

33
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,610
for

34
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:11,560
no flash yes nor no animated yes we just
take

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,010
longer to download speeds when a dial-up
preferences should ask

36
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,768
what is my connection speed and have
dial up is check its limit the size

37
00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:24,129
enemy to Jeffs presented to the user
just also haven't

38
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,290
all component with and height if you
include those with an Heights components

39
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,078
than a table can load while the rest of
the document fills in

40
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,749
otherwise it has to wait until it loads
the graphic so it knows with a width and

41
00:02:37,749 --> 00:02:38,249
height are

42
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:42,909
and then can display %uh the table again
a great waste of time

43
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:48,388
it doesn't know if I have graphics
turned off

44
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:51,620
women who would turn graphics of well

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,819
people whose families can't display
graphics I have a

46
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:58,269
picture of another 32 teletype your
which on Fort Lee is not coming up

47
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,019
if you visit my website Cheshire
catalyst dot com

48
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,299
slash flash talk dot HTML

49
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:10,650
it will have these graphics and I'll

50
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,090
Desai people can't display graphics
college students

51
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,529
during exam week turn off graphics but
but colleges have also been with

52
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:23,889
yeah lots a band with foreign tired or
you ever been in a dorm during exam week

53
00:03:23,889 --> 00:03:28,279
everybody's hitting the web that band
with gets down to a little sliver

54
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:32,579
and you know what the graphics you want
the information content for your study

55
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:35,680
to try of the graphics also

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,900
people with links the text-based web
browser

57
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,129
are still used by blind users with me so
the sizes

58
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,768
web browsers with limited plans

59
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,510
on their cell phones %uh there's a whole
nother subject

60
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,529
where I get invited to 0 visit
somebody's website

61
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:57,639
I try to pick it up on my cell phones
I'm right there in the store

62
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,549
and ok so you can see is what they will
flash or the RAM in your store trying to

63
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,999
your website to get some more stuff

64
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:07,978
and i cant get there because you decide
to have Flash

65
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,979
there's also PDA uses our pilots

66
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,280
with web browsers on and

67
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,049
summer web browsers 0 they can't handle
flash

68
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:28,049
I'm sorry you're not reaching us it
takes forever to download Flash content

69
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,860
a who wants flash

70
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,350
well the advertising agencies okay
flashes expensive to develop

71
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,620
so that neither the Billings increase
and that's where we're headed season 2

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,940
is increasing their billings also you
the fastest processors and video screens

73
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,960
to develop it

74
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,169
more Billings was gonna buy that faster
hardware

75
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,030
thing you have to put a copy that
hardware on decision-makers desk

76
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,140
so that you can see it and so who how
flashy

77
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,210
how eye-catching

78
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,599
you wanna waste this guy's time and want
to approve the project

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
you can deploy the other Flash graphics

80
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,940
and get out there before the public so

81
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,940
arm ever housing agencies love flash

82
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,520
80 clients are sold on the value of the
MTV affect and love the fact that

83
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,510
they're getting product will keep the
test for the audience

84
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,340
but for how long as you want 'em back to
your website in the future

85
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,680
gonna sit through that thing again and
again and

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,940
again they don't like it

87
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,010
it irritates them one rule that housing

88
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,289
don't irritate the customer the pop-up
box always asked

89
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,230
always trust my committee content there
is no box I can check it says

90
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,350
never trust met the media content or
never asked me this question

91
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:52,530
again you could say it never happens but
again for this version of Flash

92
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,760
or below and that's fine when the next
version comes out

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,230
ask me again but wait until then leaves

94
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,480
know who can't use flash people laugh
about an ass carnation

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,960
but muscular chasing a mature miles per
hour literally

96
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,280
sure what to wear TVs out there Web TV
users can't use Facebook maybe

97
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,390
they purchase your product pepsi's a
good example of this

98
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,780
turkey sending me emails all the time
composer flashy website

99
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,230
I get there and yes is flashy Alexis got
flash but i cant download flash

100
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,780
when I'm at work my firewall on the job
when I'm home in a dialogue

101
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,300
it takes for ever for content I don't
even what

102
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,590
because it wastes my time I what
information contact

103
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,110
not lips up blind uses I got bigger
market who cares a very lenient

104
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,290
right R-twelve the Americans with
Disabilities Act may

105
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,370
rear its ugly head at some point are you
may want to keep that mine

106
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,880
people behind corporate firewalls were
downloaded any kind are forbidden

107
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,330
paranoid people who are too afraid to
what malware might be in a flash

108
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,780
attachment

109
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,030
we had actors here at this conference we
would never go

110
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,230
love such a thing I'm sure up so

111
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,550
the question is Watson ever Kaiser to do

112
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:13,639
art don't just say get flash or get gone

113
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,050
building a non flash page is billable to

114
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,770
you can hire on an extra programmer for
that that's billable

115
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:24,200
a if you can find the Rules page %uh
contest

116
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,760
usually it will jump you to a non flash
page reconnect just

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,940
fill in the form and enter the contest
that's what you need to do

118
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,260
is have a way of getting the consumer to
the contest page you can

119
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,580
get there email address get into options
you can sell them

120
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,800
more stop isn't that what it's all about

121
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
so basically

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,210
flash sucks for advertisers and sucked
is a technical term meaning

123
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,610
customer dissatisfaction you don't wanna
piss off your customer

124
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,770
so find a way around using Flash and get
it out there

125
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:06,770
any questions yes

126
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,840
other steven is the flashes easier to
deploy for advertising agency

127
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,590
this is true up flair Macromedia

128
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,880
which creates and distributes flash is
now owned by Adobe

129
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,600
and the whole Adobe Acrobat model is to
give away viewer software

130
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,419
and then sell development software and
this works very well for

131
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:32,279
for flash from that standpoint

132
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,448
the fact that flash is eye candy
contract the I love the decision-makers

133
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:39,620
another good reason from agency
standpoint but

134
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,269
when it comes to consumer you're telling
consumers with

135
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:46,529
and you don't want your to consumers
because they make just walk away from

136
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,279
you at that point

137
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,079
and that's not what you want

138
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:55,639
yes 0 good

139
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,999
but mic wasn't working czech chick other

140
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,439
so why not just have go for

141
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:06,319
instead of the web isn't HTML to

142
00:09:06,319 --> 00:09:10,019
whiz-bang like should we just have text
for everything then

143
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,509
work takes just pointed out that your ok
that's fine arm

144
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,589
text for being is fine and in fact when
you have

145
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,910
a graphic do have an alt tag on saying
what the graphic is for those people

146
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,680
who do turn off graphics arm go for is
good but I love

147
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,720
know anybody's really program for go for
any more

148
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,720
what happens when people don't program
originally more

149
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,249
and everyone uses flash assuming that
happens a flash still comes in under a

150
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:35,999
TTP

151
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,850
Hypertext Transfer Protocol so it will
still be

152
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,670
Nishino readable page

153
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,529
should be at any rate okay i was just
curious

154
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:52,709
okay thank you at this point I'd like to
choose my friend very

155
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,910
green who will bring up the next

156
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,040
part over representation here

157
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,269
okay you now

158
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:08,829
you

159
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:12,509
which button

160
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:17,649
first

161
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:24,649
weird

162
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:36,110
see me mouses

163
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,570
yes

164
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:43,570
right because

165
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:56,850
this

166
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:31,229
good morning

167
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,069
I'm sure a green light introduce myself
island in the Orlando area

168
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:40,059
for 25 26 years I'm a transplant

169
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:45,118
she said from Green Bay Wisconsin over
the last 10 years

170
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:48,350
retired 25

171
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,779
twenty-some years before that I was in
computer sales

172
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,290
in 20 years before that I was in the
educational field worked at the college

173
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:56,919
level

174
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,929
district office level regional service
agencies across 37 school districts

175
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,089
in urban us city districts

176
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,790
and in high school middle school and
elementary levels

177
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,480
my presentation today is on the

178
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,480
the digital divide

179
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:43,520
its some things

180
00:12:43,979 --> 00:12:50,979
which

181
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,130
that's what the objectives

182
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,230
for the for this digital divide
presentation first objective is

183
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:11,600
can we shrink the digital divide faster
has been sinking

184
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,260
very faster than last year in fact it's
quite fast acceleration

185
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,300
but there is a large residual group of
people

186
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,390
that are still left behind in this
process

187
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,310
can people with limited reading skills

188
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,630
use the internet most of us

189
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:33,020
have long held a bias about limited
readers

190
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,740
which will exploring this presentation
can text to speech

191
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,120
help teach reading we look at this

192
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,510
interesting possibility and what

193
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,840
text to speech has to offer who among us

194
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,370
are capable and willing to help this is
my primary present

195
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,620
purpose for this presentation today to
the whole organization

196
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,680
and beyond hopefully from a contact with
other folks that in this particular area

197
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,270
lets the fine

198
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,240
the common understanding the digital
divide

199
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,230
it's basically individuals without
access to computer

200
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,030
internet the capabilities

201
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:29,030
on to use

202
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,699
equipment many people are are

203
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,010
just unaware other unlike many people

204
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,240
lot more people are fearful

205
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,160
using the internet because they've
really are

206
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,750
have fear failure hardware however

207
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,180
and software and connectivity an honor

208
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,680
primary concerns their other areas

209
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,320
that are you in have greater concern in
this area

210
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,660
a brief aside 4e a quick

211
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,089
Packers trivia question what city in the
United States

212
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,730
was the first city to have free internet
access

213
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,920
broadband throughout its business
district we'll

214
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,840
look for answers that the question your

215
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,080
presentation let's look at trends in the
digital divide

216
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,240
how many a bus are using

217
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,680
e-books blogs the week Ian this
organization

218
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,720
and the like on cell phones and
blackberries

219
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,230
iPad's and PDA's during your commute
back and forth to work

220
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,320
while exercising and why we're just

221
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,380
relaxing is

222
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,400
remote communication between people

223
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,310
increasing or decreasing we can safely
say

224
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,640
that there's been a

225
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,240
large increase in the

226
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,480
spread

227
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,350
of between people who are

228
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,800
like yourself who are high end users and

229
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,790
people who are non-users we can also
safely say

230
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:19,670
shrinking because we have far greater

231
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:24,230
far less number individuals who are not
using the Internet

232
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,800
today is a publication industry moving

233
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,970
into e-books we'll pursue that slightly
and take a look at

234
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,060
book pub book usage

235
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,390
and the options have the

236
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,740
is reading required to use the web

237
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,890
any books basically

238
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,069
most of us have a bias on we believe
that

239
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,530
we must be able to read in order to use
the Internet and although there are lots

240
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,780
of people who have relatively limited
reading

241
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:07,240
their potentials for us to circumvent
that process

242
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,599
let's have a reality check for a moment

243
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,720
about the book I was on the internet
just last week

244
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,280
stumbled across this particular

245
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,939
group data one-third of all high school
graduates

246
00:17:22,939 --> 00:17:26,220
never read another book arrested their
life

247
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,480
spring forty-two percent of college
graduates

248
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,190
never re another fifty-eight percent
have

249
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,090
I love adults United States never read
another book after high school

250
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:43,159
by the way this is a way to sneak in
some information that wasn't presented

251
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,320
first 1/3 because this comes all

252
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,540
drop population as well

253
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,990
eighty percent United States families
did not buy

254
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,400
or read a book last year

255
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,160
seventy percent of US adults have not
been in the bookstore

256
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,060
can past last five years fifty percent

257
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,340
new books I'm not read to come

258
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,720
to completion

259
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,929
let's not focus on the people who have

260
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,230
who have not have chosen not to read
books

261
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,429
but instead let's look at the internet
and those people who are unable to use

262
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,080
it

263
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,149
because they cannot read the content on
the front page

264
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,870
we have federal law section five away
the deals with the blind

265
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:36,860
learning disabilities we have the Daisy
consortium is a group for publishers

266
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,390
that are focused on publication material

267
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:44,900
he in in print form and and also

268
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:51,150
five away has to do with the internet
computers as well as print

269
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,960
why is it that we are overlooking

270
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,940
other groups who are limited readers

271
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,130
which hinder their learning and
employment potential

272
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,170
what groups either should toddlers

273
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,280
access the web without being able to re

274
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:17,280
should school-age limited readers should
be allowed to learn in school

275
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,580
until they become proficient readers

276
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,090
should limited reading adults be allowed
to use the web to acquire information

277
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,620
and learning

278
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,679
to become more productive members of our
society

279
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,500
how easy can it become for these groups

280
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,610
to access the web

281
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,730
reading on the internet people with
limited reading skills

282
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:49,950
can easily learn to access information
online

283
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,340
but he takes summer components to do
this

284
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,689
first of all it takes an introduction we
need to have an orientation

285
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,060
one-on-one or hope fully

286
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,560
on the net and interactive type format

287
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,620
could be created takes an interest

288
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,400
what's interesting is if if individuals

289
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,730
have an interesting topic that they
choose themselves that they

290
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:18,900
really want information about their

291
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,900
interest will propel them into that
information

292
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,920
and successfully will be able to see
them

293
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,960
information speech them open

294
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,920
this closed-door print this copy

295
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,530
interest learners

296
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:39,570
and be a major benefit to them

297
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:44,450
what process can we use to make a smooth
transition

298
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,480
to text to speech

299
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,210
text to speech to read

300
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,010
text to speech enables a new in freeway
to learn to read

301
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,650
there are gaps in the complete solution

302
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:05,640
needs to be software written that ties
text to speech

303
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,020
to the learning process based on
findings

304
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,830
this will if properly done with

305
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,889
learner interest be self-motivated

306
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,929
self propelling and hopefully program in
a way that it can be

307
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:24,970
self-directed

308
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,860
online content interest to the
individual

309
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,040
provides incentives to continue

310
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,040
to the learning process

311
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,500
we will work not only on reading alone

312
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,870
but we will break into its components
hopefully

313
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,600
beginning with fun X which is the basic
structure

314
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,659
getting into comprehension or reading

315
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,540
and other components skills necessary

316
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,720
it's no small task but one of the source
needs

317
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,280
it's like declaring a national priority

318
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,230
on the light side just as an aside in
contrast to the earlier stance

319
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,880
on the use of the book there exist

320
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,720
today on the Internet a website

321
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,630
that has 300,000 e-books which are all

322
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,470
free they were put up there on July 4th

323
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,350
and very symbolic date in our history of
our country

324
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,230
and after August 4th

325
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:37,060
100,000 these books will be left up out
there permanently

326
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,399
for people to have access hopefully be
able to use

327
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:47,250
text to speech to listen to

328
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,220
like to think I've text to speech as the
technologies

329
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,760
sleeping giant not only text to speech

330
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,560
but I'm concerned about voice in hand
voice our

331
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,889
both both

332
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,659
methods process let's look at

333
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:10,250
the talking page becoming self

334
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:14,429
talk reading text to speech

335
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,820
is one of the elements need to add to
that

336
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,580
function facility with the Internet
Explorer Google

337
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,189
throw in some other skills on the
Internet like being able to diagram a

338
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,370
sentencing using

339
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,750
talking dictionary and then

340
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,990
we would move into voice recognition
later

341
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,290
which will allow us to deal with we're
all reading

342
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,250
and writing skills we mix all this up

343
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,260
and throw this into hopper

344
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,658
have a free-form database free-form
relational database

345
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:53,510
that has components text Voice and video

346
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,710
and now we can begin to roll up our
sleeves

347
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,330
thing off my jacket and you want to get
into the details

348
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,720
this program as we look up in the first
component

349
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,750
1 o'clock diagram here its

350
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,050
disliking reedy if you

351
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,770
have struggled in school with 3d or know
anybody that has

352
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,730
me know that they become disenchanted
with the printed page

353
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,030
and the reading process one ever take my
techniques that I

354
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,940
strongly recommend is his stupid the
percent

355
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,780
try to use text to speech

356
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,190
in order to do this we really have to

357
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:40,590
manipulate the person by starting to say
well

358
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,639
what are the interest areas that you're
most interested

359
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,120
to 345 tell me what those areas are

360
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:52,890
hi I have a technique for use with

361
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:57,060
Internet Explorer go up into the
favorites I put persons name down

362
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,428
up there let's grab a couple names Adam

363
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:04,500
Zoe and and war

364
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,710
Lori excuse me those three names

365
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:11,200
just happened to be the name of my 30
grandson

366
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,550
and his two-year-old sister and

367
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:17,760
Lauren who shins

368
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,158
in her second day on the rest of her
life today

369
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,600
she was born yesterday so third

370
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,919
pro grandfather I we take the topics

371
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:32,409
the three-year-old for example was
capable of

372
00:25:32,409 --> 00:25:36,919
love listening and understanding a lot
text to speech

373
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,290
and we ask him what what are your main
interests and when we do that

374
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:43,560
he comes up with I like bob the Builder
and or

375
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,159
like Thomas the Train and if you list
five

376
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,360
if 43 whatever number of topic areas
that that particular

377
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,040
individual whether their child or an
adult under

378
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,909
their name under Favorites and then go
out and find five web sites and each of

379
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:00,730
those topics

380
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:05,060
and then copy those web sites over under
Favorites

381
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:09,090
then you take the person out there in
and we're going to use

382
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:12,540
text to speech now there's a many

383
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:16,740
TTS is out there document readers page
readers tax treaties whatever you want

384
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,480
to call them

385
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,270
and they're appearing quality levels of

386
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,389
annunciation the one that

387
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,470
I use is one of the largest insulation
bases in the world

388
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,550
it's on Canada's call replys dot com and
the need to Sparta

389
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:37,440
replys is that it's free they have two
other versions that you can pay money

390
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,940
for

391
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,240
but this free version is copied onto
your computer

392
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,300
and then you go into the favorites pick
anyone these web sites

393
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,290
take Lanham out there or any adult out
there

394
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,379
hit that particular website see the
print material in front of you

395
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:59,320
and say all I can't read block it cut it

396
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,320
pasted into this program hit the play
button the plane but will allow you to

397
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,689
talk

398
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,970
any speed use you select it will allow
you also to magnify the print bigger

399
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:10,700
smaller

400
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:14,510
it allows you to pick for voices it's
free

401
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,830
what happens then is after you do this

402
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,520
over a bunch of periods of time a beat
10 15 25

403
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,320
maybe fifty times the individual gets
the sea

404
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,439
hey if I'm an adult I can read

405
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,730
and all this print material that's been
totally unavailable to me all the Sun

406
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,360
I can get access to ALL that's just

407
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,450
awesome opportunity that's been

408
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:45,840
in the field since I first bought my
hobby is computer

409
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,400
in 1978 with ways recognition

410
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,410
the text to speech programs came in to
have

411
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,120
decent operation about ten years ago and
in the last five years

412
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,170
they've been very acceptable but they do

413
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,480
in my mind represent an absolute
sleeping giant as the use this program

414
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,860
we begin to like text to speech

415
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,940
people become happy listeners

416
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,910
and then after that we kinda shift gears
a little

417
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:19,060
we offer them a concept that says

418
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:23,500
how would you like to be able to as a
sideline be able to

419
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,070
learn how to read just kinda like a
hobby

420
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:31,340
make it easy and painless and

421
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,040
most people will kinda go along with
that

422
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,409
particularly if they can be doing things

423
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,820
and learning things day 10

424
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,129
not somebody else use them as an
assignment

425
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,000
learning that most of us have
participated in

426
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,650
so basically what we do is we grab that
information

427
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,290
and love we say well

428
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,000
let's let's see a little demonstration
here we're gonna do a demonstration of a

429
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,930
word capture

430
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,560
I want you to visualize with me now that

431
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,690
we're going out into this this

432
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,140
free-form database we put on before okay

433
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,740
its like this big holding tank and

434
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,680
we're going to have it structured as you
would look at a spreadsheet

435
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,310
so we have a spreadsheet down the side
with all the words

436
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,929
men across the top we have all these
topics

437
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:31,880
and the topics are going to be the first
columns going to be

438
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,720
new word and all the words are the
second column would be the Talking

439
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,550
Dictionary now out there on the internet

440
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:42,190
is a free dictionaries if you go into it
there's a fanatic pronunciation if you

441
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,880
touch that

442
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,710
with your mouse it breaks the word in
its phonetic parts for

443
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,980
very nicely done the next column

444
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,610
I would have hidden in the background
explain that later

445
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,560
there are forty 6 180 characters that we
use when we talk

446
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,770
and I would have the versions of the

447
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,940
I or you in their multiple painful
ramifications of how we

448
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,200
pronounce each one of those listed first
and then I'd have all the individual

449
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,190
vials sounds

450
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:16,550
like be see the K

451
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,879
all the way through the alphabet and
then at the end that I have

452
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,240
but %eh in whns agency each and all the
other some through

453
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,630
forty-six okay now that person doesn't
see that that's in the background

454
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,030
so we're gonna try and capture a word so

455
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:37,840
we have them going through a page and
they listen to the page

456
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,080
and then we we say to the person well
hope

457
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,610
let's see what we can get out of this
page from learning perspective

458
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,620
now when we teach reading we know that
the first thing you do

459
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:52,510
is to take advantage above the words
that a child has learned

460
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,300
from memory visually that's cool site
for Caterpillar's so we Grampus Eight

461
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,470
for gamblers

462
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,580
in a preschooler a child in kindergarten
so far that's 150 words

463
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:06,320
at the usually acquire in people that
are older and into adulthood you may

464
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,040
have

465
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,450
3 500 1500 or even a thousand or so

466
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:15,220
because we learn a lot about traffic
traffic words and

467
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,810
restaurant names and all that kinda
stuff so we take this page that

468
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:24,090
since Lerner has listened to the first
time and we say let's go back over

469
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,400
we're gonna do something different this
time I want to look at the beginning at

470
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,630
this page

471
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,750
and i watch look at the page and pick
out the first word you already know

472
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,990
and so they look at the first word and
guess what it could be the word

473
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,010
so they know the word okay musher

474
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,060
you know virtually almost all

475
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:47,510
us people who who are illiterate have
some degree

476
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,930
love love basic reading

477
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:55,440
that are limited so the word does pit
well what we do is we need programming

478
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,140
here

479
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,450
to take what's going on on this text to
speech page now

480
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,060
on that's pretty much wine here days to
seek

481
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,159
that kinda horsepower his we need to
take the mouse

482
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,360
move it up touch the word though

483
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,280
double-click on the left-hand bottom and
that will be highlighted

484
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,450
and we need a program that says take
that word now

485
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,550
and bowls that word the

486
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:24,460
and then next program search for that
page

487
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:27,350
and find all the other those in
Baltimore on the page at the bottom make

488
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,690
a total dominance is under 12 14 those
on this page

489
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,390
and then US the individual well

490
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,010
let's look up at the top of the page and
see what the next word is you know

491
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,160
is at hand is it or whatever but you
know

492
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,460
and repeat the process over and over
again so you have all these words being

493
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,080
being bold and highlighted tabulated out
the bottom

494
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,620
when you get done with the page even
those with very limited reading

495
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,620
capabilities

496
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:02,650
got 50 percent seventy percent of the
page that they already know how to read

497
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,410
and that in itself has a motivating
factor

498
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,290
let's go on to the second page now will
turn the page over

499
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:14,330
and we see on the next page that every
word from the first pages been carried

500
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,450
over and saw all those an answer but
some

501
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:19,930
there are highlighted and the REIT
Adelaide on the second page

502
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,100
so we have those numbers also
accumulated okay

503
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:28,240
now we keep doing this until week after
all no words

504
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,810
which are this 150 your thousand-word
vocabulary

505
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:36,159
you know some point in time we also need

506
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,180
to worry about

507
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,860
building beyond the site for Camry we
take an hour into this forty four

508
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,320
phonetic area

509
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,290
that we're talking about making the
spreadsheet alright

510
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:52,620
then the person excuse me

511
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,940
then the person is basically

512
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:00,360
going to take on new words now there's
another segment to the process that

513
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,520
that we call comprehension really and
will be doing theirs we go back over the

514
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,660
page again

515
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,168
and listen to it and this time we say
we'll is there anything on this page

516
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:13,190
because you're interested in this page
and it's a topic that you like

517
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,889
is there anything on this page if you
want to remember for future reference

518
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:18,259
and so we can create

519
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,700
and external segment have a database
that allows them to capture certain

520
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,280
elements on the page putting out
inundated

521
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,310
any organize data is given some kinda
label where they can find them again

522
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,730
and help them to comprehend reading is a
significant element

523
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:36,740
reading okay so

524
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:40,179
basically as we do this then and we keep
doing this

525
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,590
some time in 10 or 15 pages later

526
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:47,790
and you come to a new page and the
person has a total and they're going on

527
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,639
all the sudden they're gonna say

528
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,290
who I know that word I know that we're I
know that word at that particular point

529
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:58,920
you have taken the person who only went
there because I've content

530
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,180
motivation and was something that they
were interested in reading

531
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,609
you now hook them into this processor
reading

532
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:09,250
the air been swept up into it and their
acquiring

533
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:13,660
their site for cambiar hand they say
will I don't know that word but that

534
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,350
word is about the topic that I'm
interested in

535
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:21,730
so that's a new word so I wanna know
that

536
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:27,450
well basically

537
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,390
there are many who want to to and need

538
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:35,029
online access but are limited to reading

539
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,110
many over my right here in New York City

540
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:41,290
in your city and in mine

541
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,240
in our nation in in the english-speaking
world

542
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,430
or by the way one of the reasons why

543
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,990
I'm interested in circumventing read and
helping limited readers

544
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,100
is because although I was

545
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,810
as a child passed on I basically flown

546
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:03,920
the second grade

547
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,140
third-grade fourth-grade fifth-grade

548
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,319
6p and seventh grade

549
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,760
at that time they tested me in my
reading level was that have a

550
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,180
second-grader

551
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,919
those years were very

552
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,750
painful but fortunately

553
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:28,160
I was given another opportunity I was
put into a special class and allowed to

554
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,490
repeat the seventh grade

555
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,590
I was able to graduate high school with
no more than a fourth grade reading

556
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,670
level in the upper half my class

557
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:42,050
and devoted my life to the things I talk
to you about in the first session

558
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,310
being a special educator for twenty
years

559
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:50,299
now that I'm retired can look back in
life and I say what are the things that

560
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,790
I haven't done

561
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:57,529
during my career when I was working and
I have time to do now

562
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:01,660
and this particular message mission is
very near and dear

563
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:07,020
to my her

564
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,560
to create this process underwear

565
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,299
I believe would help many individuals

566
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,910
and give them renewed cage or

567
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,629

programs that you can pay money for

585
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,259

lots of them read aloud is common one

586
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,120
and many others

587
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,970
and they have charges this particular
program if you buy the two components is

588
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,260

one thank you for the early day to you
and which is a very disturbing

598
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,250
your legs sure you have a sense

599
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,330
have ideas for your sense how the trains
are the last few years ago an educator

600
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,819
summit decades a

601
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,950
wells getting nice if if we listen to
what's going on

602
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:43,130
in the field of education the if the

603
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,540
process has been slowly crumbling

604
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,180
from within and without okay

605
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,210
it processes hood crumbles from the
parents I defense because parents are

606
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,800
are indulging their children too early
with too much

607
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,820
television computer games was whatever
the technology that we've kinda brought

608
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,030
into the world

609
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,120
and not really you know going into
reading and spending time in reading

610
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,839
working even towards that parents don't
do reading readiness at home in the

611
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,260
child gets a school

612
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,120
they will fall behind and those that
fall behind fall off

613
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,700
the the treadmill love learning because
it sent the bill

614
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,640
generally lockstep thing and when you
fall off your in trouble

615
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,180
and you stay in trouble and by the time
you get to middle school

616
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,500
truss you heat

617
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,820
and there's a lot kids the bottom 20
percent

618
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,450
education basic

619
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,840
its its it's really you know it's
getting worse

620
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,910
and to help this the federal government
states are making these national tests

621
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,089
in Florida we have an Afghan test

622
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:57,050
and we're testing academic function

623
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:02,040
okay were testing content and all
content is really important

624
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,410
and the kinds of schools that we grew up
in were content-based schools

625
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:09,670
okay there was some process in our
schools and quite frankly

626
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:13,120
with the internet and the access the
information with WiFi

627
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,859
him even more so in the next couple
years content is not something we have

628
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:18,109
to store here

629
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:22,279
we have been have access to that
digitally I mean I can grab in my pocket

630
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,300
and ground and advice and say go on the
internet and what do I need to find

631
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:29,630
I will get it I need to know how to find
it I need

632
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:32,820
know how to evaluate it and I need

633
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:37,100
know how to put to use in my life those
are processed

634
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:42,230
and so are the the need to read actually

635
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,660
is is 21 hear something scary

636
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,040
I consider it change it or I don't
consider it a long-term

637
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,160
need because although hoover

638
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:58,109
made the printing press and we're
celebrating

639
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:01,830
these Gutenberg Project which is 35
years aged

640
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,000
which is pretty awesome itself I
envision

641
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,730
the future will be more p graphic gooey
world

642
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,310
he information will be transmitted and I
know we don't like to look at the MTV

643
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,590
any a marriage is pretty much but the
content stinks

644
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:24,240
but the process the process is the way
your mind works

645
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,630
the printed page works way to use law

646
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,770
for the capabilities of our human mind

647
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,200
and all and very few of us and the world
that we live in has not focused on

648
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,060
developing

649
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:41,150
what's called photographic mine when I
studied to be a special educator

650
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:44,750
I learned about two standard deviations
on both ends of the scale

651
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,640
and on the gift inside okay there are
many

652
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,450
things we need to worry about it percent
upside down or not

653
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:55,470
its 10 minutes okay harm

654
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,520
we need to you get different time
schedules

655
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,220
between to good home

656
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:05,400
we really we really need to to

657
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,650
be aware that this information we now

658
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:12,200
transmit to to ourselves can be
condensed

659
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:16,200
into still images can be put into

660
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,810
minuscule clips not the sizeof
commercial

661
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,350
one 23 seconds or so you can mean

662
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,529
the Chinese explain to us

663
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:30,850
thousand years ago a picture is worth

664
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:33,940
how many words so

665
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,359
so we need to learn that message and

666
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:41,109
and the only reason why we don't have it
had it recently is because we've only

667
00:43:41,109 --> 00:43:42,250
had

668
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,839
com megabytes gigabytes

669
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:50,049
you know but we have terabytes now

670
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:53,200
and a thousand times more into petabytes

671
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,400
and we have that all out there now in
it's like having this huge closet

672
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,930
in our in our intellectual house that's
empty right now

673
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,020
we will fill that closet okay

674
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,130
hand we've been concerned

675
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,810
with dot matrix images

676
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:17,000
okay we we don't need to have week we
can

677
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,320
we can transmit through raster and their
conversions from

678
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,839
from dot matrix interested masters
enormously more efficient in controlling

679
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:26,770
data

680
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:30,609
and so there's a lot of things out there
that are yet to be harvested

681
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:34,000
but the saddest thing is we are falling
further and be

682
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,359
further and further behind in

683
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:41,640
application software development and
hardware utilization

684
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,270
I'm worried that your date is pointing
to some science fiction

685
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,700
stories becoming reality whether it's a
science fiction story a

686
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,310
comics without words and

687
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:55,549
my wife's retired teacher and she talked
to some the sewers students in reading

688
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,890
as the UI

689
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:01,450
with the talking brings member from yeah
you this book

690
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,660
well brings you for talking in there is
nothing other than

691
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,549
that's where food is an ass for what
about Library Thing is

692
00:45:08,549 --> 00:45:12,720
yeah well you know can't now with cat
scanning going on in this

693
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,410
looking into our brains and seeing
what's going on in our brains

694
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,720
live were thinking on

695
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,359
we probably will be seeing even though
I'm almost 70 years old I potentially

696
00:45:26,359 --> 00:45:28,078
can see in my lifetime

697
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,380
the ability to find a way to transmit
information

698
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,529
90 not through our eyes

699
00:45:35,529 --> 00:45:39,589
not through our years a Sony sony has a
patent on that that was

700
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:43,460
about the Times's Service Pack the idea

701
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,779
the idea is not information

702
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,990
the idea of life is a process

703
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:53,920
and learning the process of living

704
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,900
how we spend hardly any time in our
school systems

705
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,059
really developing what we are who we are

706
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:04,690
and more importantly why we are and so
I'm into other things beyond

707
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:07,849
text to speech been developing
curriculum

708
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:12,170
and a new concept of the learning
environment in the future

709
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,609
and also home we'd

710
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,670
to look at life and discover

711
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,160
you as a person who and what your

712
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,640
those bits a communication for sessions
may I ask any

713
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,009
as you're gonna see website has the the
books were posted July 4th e-books

714
00:46:31,009 --> 00:46:35,170
whole it just put down the the Gutenberg
Project

715
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,799
for farm gutenberg our work

716
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:43,059
or put down 300,000 e-books and

717
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:48,390
ill be there thank you again even any
other questions

718
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,470
here's my

719
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:57,170
yes this might be a bit off topic but I
was wondering what your opinion is the

720
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,569
No Child Left Behind Act

721
00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:01,650
is you know the ideal Elzinga school its

722
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:07,499
well my concept is real simple I have
come from a world that's been built

723
00:47:07,499 --> 00:47:13,950
educationally generally from the top
down No Child Left Behind and way before

724
00:47:13,950 --> 00:47:14,609
that

725
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:17,730
way back in this in the sixties when I
got my message

726
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,819
exception education we were concerned

727
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:25,849
a bow going to the bottom in building at
the bottom

728
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:29,349
and in are bottomless

729
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,249
is exception alleys people that are
physically mentally and emotionally

730
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:37,349
very limited in all kinds of ways I've
learned in my life

731
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:41,130
there those of us that we've given a
significant

732
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,549
challenge in life have an advantage

733
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:48,079
over people generally given all the
positive guess

734
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,900
because if we r cable to over comments
that have succumbed

735
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,200
we've become very very strong people
okay

736
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,029
and very driven people and so

737
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:04,859
the No Child Left Behind thing I support
I'm concerned primarily in this

738
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:05,819
presentation

739
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:09,249
about working with people that are right
above that group

740
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:13,039
okay this twenty percent at the bottom
that's growing

741
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:16,440
and festering in causing our society
enormous

742
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:23,440
problems and expense okay the answer
session at this time

743
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,579
during I will be out though think order
efforts of those who want to

744
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:32,599
with us thanks for coming enjoy your
convention here

745
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:34,440
were village be seeing you
