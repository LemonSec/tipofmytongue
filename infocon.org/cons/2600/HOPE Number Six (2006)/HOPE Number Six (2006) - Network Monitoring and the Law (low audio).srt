that this is network monitoring in the
and the law with Alex months

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,500

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,580
state X always talk to an attorney in
that state

9
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,230
this isn't legal advice you have
questions

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,580
popular in your jurisdiction maybe some
weird little wrinkle

11
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,269
Glee also one wanna tell you today

actually check I was reading an 9th
circuit now

14
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:04,629
about seismic work thanks everyone

15
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,570
thanks to all youth thanks people
organized hope I also want to thank

16

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,200
and of course my Moscow okay

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,299
or eyepiece

19
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:25,790
stalking wanna system internet working
your can look you're right you're right

20
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,020
depend on where you know how close you
are to be someone's

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,390
authorized look at traffic so yourself
accordingly

22
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,630
i wanna talk about what protected
traffic is and what is in

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,789
and how can you protect yourself and
your organization

24
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:44,820
and what does the future hold try to
make some

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,880
half assed gases what future okay

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,429
there a couple important statutes that
really determine what your rights are

27
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:53,729
busy network

28
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,320
on fourth amendment to the US
Constitution an important one

29
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,570
still we hope the

30
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,960
wire law it's all wiretap act which has
been amended by the Electronic

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,539
Communications Privacy Act

32
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:12,310
on the stored Communications Act
definitions

33
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:17,060
a pen register in trapping trees going
to what those are and then there's the

34
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,090
local statutes that affect your rights
as well Fourth Amendment we still have

35
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,490
one

36
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,430
what what's left right people to be
secure

37
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,480
now persons houses papers and effects

38
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,609
doesn't say packets electronic
communications papers and effects

39
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,080
I'm gonna go into how this is changed

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,310
years but against unreasonable searches

41
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,620
a recent searches doesn't save search

42
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,350
some things it doesn't apply to just not
applied

43
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,769
non-governmental actors if AT&T looks

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,700
your stuff completely different rules
Fourth Amendment longer applies

45
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,560
if AT&T quest to the federal government
looks at your stuff

46
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,990
then it does apply however even for

47
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,580
a private actors looking you were
communications

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,660
there are state laws that prevent what's
going on

49
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,480
intrusion into seclusion now

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,530
I'm gonna go into a little bit history
lesson because the

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,110
way the fourth amendment has been
interpreted has changed over the years

52
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,150
this is an all rule this is this is no
longer current law but i wanna show

53
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,250
state because the idea was of course you
have new

54
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,390
privacy rights in this new fangled
telephone

55
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,560
think your broadcasting your thoughts
your statements

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,780
on wires your house and go

57
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,460
and reasonable

58
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,840
to the police dept you offered you it's
like

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,080
broadcasting and that was because 1928

60
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,770
not you know the phone was not yet
completely endorsed by everybody not

61
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,410
everyone had a phone in their house

62
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,510
roll around and that was the law until
1967 when

63
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,340
same thing guys a bookie

64
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,450
guys making phone calls placing in
taking bets

65
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,009
police underarms I can't put a cap on

66
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,019
someone no warrant nothing in the go you
know

67
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,530
really I think framers the constitution
would imply

68
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,370
that you you have a privacy writing
blood doesn't change

69
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,610
same for them all of a sudden the court
says

70
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,910
now you have a privacy right so now

71
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:39,340
is unreasonable your lines without as a
fairly strong

72
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:44,500
it this this holding kind it's important
for future use because it's

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,970
is there you have an expectation of
privacy that

74
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,730
you expect and then do you have an
expectation of privacy that society

75
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,570
expects

76
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,130
and we can't establish this rule kinda
for the wrong

77
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,770
to the fed's sniff your email

78
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,200
can they sniff what pack what what you
know what web sites

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,940
looking so we have the wiretap

80
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,280
this is passed in nineteen sixty-eight
after the cats in

81
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,440
and effectively codifies

82
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,670
its updated twice updated in 1986 when
they make it

83
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,790
it's no longer just phones its
electronic communication

84
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,220
and its updated again in 2001 the USA
PATRIOT Act

85
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,730
I'm through this and last minute because
FIS is kinda

86
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:37,910
interest right now a little bit in
defines a

87
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,080
now this is kinda got the wiretapped
interception is

88
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,289
acquisition contents and I highway to
back its kinda important

89
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:48,760
any electronica world communication

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,050
through any device really really really
I don't know what this means

91
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,290
the courts don't know what it means does
this mean that the feds can even

92
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,760
sniff one me wraps contents

93
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,880
the there's a holding

94
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,240
in Steve Jackson games secret service
which is

95
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,060
probably landmark case interception
claims

96
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,510
not only because it said precedent
that's followed in almost every state

97
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,980
its also the founding this is the case
that founded the

98
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,919
people are pissed off about this case
and said I want to do something about it

99
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,299
under the wiretap I'm you're facing up
to five years

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,400
and victim five years in prison if you
violate the wiretap

101
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,190
act I even if your law enforcement if
you violate

102
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,620
and victims may sue for whatever damages
have

103
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,830
and legal fees in the suit I'm

104
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,609
also your protectors exclusionary rule
that says

105
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,240
evidence taken under this is
inadmissible in federal court

106
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,400
now what is interception look like gotta
now half assed

107
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,090
map here say sending email to be

108
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,720
if yeah whose it comes from his personal
pc

109
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,500
to mail server the Internet 2 B's mail
server

110
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,310
down to be she wants to read the mail
before be

111
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,240
would-be interceptions scrapping on the
wire this was sort of an important one

112
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,610
to seek

113
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:21,320
Steve Jackson if see sniffs it why
what's being transmitted

114
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,900
its intersection wiretap if he gets

115
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,790
their gets between on the lawn between

116
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,320
copies mail server and be might

117
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,370
if he somehow gets access to be his mail
server

118
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,980
polls how storage see for example be is
a popcorn

119
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,940
om store waiting for be to pop in

120
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,810
she gets in beats the mail not
interception

121
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,960
that was the case in Steve Jackson where
the feds came in without a warrant

122
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,580
took Steve Jackson's mail server read
the mail on it

123
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,960
some mail before never got to the the
actual owners

124
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,810
and the and court said past nine
interceptions

125
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,900
any storage is

126
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,470
anything from storage is not
interception rule

127
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:15,250
other couple interception exceptions
that allows you to intercept male

128
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,690
under are intercepts are any electronic
communication no matter what

129
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,469
if you the recipient you're allowed to
look at its it's one of those

130
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,180
things but I think they want to prevent
you know

131
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,340
if you're your lab to sniff your own
track I'm

132
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:36,250
service provider now this is this is
fluid terminal show you later

133
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,399
agents and employees service provider

134
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:42,510
to provide service to protect the rights

135
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:47,310
and the facilities so your allow to look
traffic if you were a

136
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,889
if you're in ISP employees you're
allowed to look at the contents

137
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:54,519
communication to protect your own system
are your

138
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,290
are your customers or other people
attached your network so if you're

139
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,309
afraid that some

140
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,850
wanna your users is sending out fires

141
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,680
span you're allowed to look for that
were because we're into protecting

142
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,999
other networks attached York's which
theoretically be

143
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:15,360
any work I'm there's this review to
determine the source

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,759
harmful electronic interference seems to
be talking about

145
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,490
radio but I've not seen any cases talk
about it so

146
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,459
who knows you may also

147
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,939
anyone may allow either

148
00:09:29,939 --> 00:09:33,009
either better state agency to come in
and

149
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,470
sniff your own if you either lack the
capability are you want to set this up

150
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,839
were some kind of law enforcement action
you were allowed to

151
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:44,069
grant to law enforcement agency without
a warrant

152
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:49,378
you may sniff my its and then there's
the final one pursuant to a valid finds

153
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,920
a quirk were

154
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,709
within the fis special secret court

155
00:09:56,709 --> 00:10:00,930
the proceedings are sealed you may
granted interception or

156
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,550
out input from the target anyone who's
given a valid

157
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,879
worry if you are an ISP fads come and
say this is about 5 order

158
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,990
you must keep your mouth shut

159
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,529
however interceptions without a valid
warrant are legal

160
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:18,699
even if under color of law I'm offended

161
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:24,100
I have 85 were I go to Verizon say I
wanna sniff some packets

162
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,699
it's still a violation rice is protected

163
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:31,529
because it's I thought it was good you
know how much was known about 5 order is

164
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:31,879
cuz

165
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:36,009
you work but it's five years
imprisonment

166
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,350
ten thousand dollar fine law enforcement
officers are

167
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,899
not immune from OPM

168
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,069
so it should be interesting considering
that the 9th circuit just said that

169
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,740
there is no state secrets

170
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,970
about the various wiretap

171
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,410
brouhaha going on so we may actually see
some NSA

172
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,709
getting arrested are not

173
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:02,059
okay there is an exception

174
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:05,519
the attorney general are the president
may were

175
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,649
why I warrantless interception if

176
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,439
known that it's between foreign powers
and agents there

177
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,959
there has to be some finding that you
are in agent

178
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,029
are you are foreign power I'm I

179
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:24,470
like the second line Mike I'm curious to
see how this please

180
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,439
now no substantial likelihood
intercepting communications

181
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:31,740
Americans are american companies so

182
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:38,240
foreign subsidiary of the US companies
also protected under five

183
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,160
even this special warrantless exception
the AG must

184
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,639
go to Congress within 30 days are
there's this emergency within 15 days a

185
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,540
declaration of war

186
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,209
clearly what's happening if it all plays
out with this AT&T case clearly there's

187
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:57,420
some violations here

188
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,248
I'm not sure who's going to actually
prosecuted because it's the same

189
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:05,399
attorney general but we'll see maybe you
know 2008 there's

190
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,399
change regime okay

191
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,089
back to what we have to deal with stored
Communications Act

192
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,119
on this is where the counterpart two
interceptions this is what happens if

193
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:17,110
you grab something

194
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,269
while it's in storage this is kinda

195
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:23,389
one half the federal hacking law

196
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:27,189
there's also the commute sorry Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act which I'm not gonna

197
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:27,860
go into

198
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,110
is there so many cases on that it's also
fairly settled

199
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,249
but its accessing stored Communications
service

200
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:38,489
on not really sure what that is

201
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:41,639
because it's kinda speak but it would
seem to be

202
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,220
ISP's mail server could be anything that

203
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,589
material our data is stored on even
temporarily

204
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:53,110
there's a incidental so theoretically

205
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,929
even plowing and memory buffer router
would be stored Communications

206
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:59,999
before its forward there's a

207
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,429
interesting split here there's a done
for profit

208
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:07,040
there's a greater effect it's a greater
penalty done for

209
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,738
the reasons and the exceptions much
broader

210
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:14,929
owner the service so it's not just

211
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:18,170
provider for protection system its I

212
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,980
the router I can but i won no I'm doing
to protect it

213
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,980
I can I could claim to be I'm being
nosey

214
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,119
I'm fries I wanna see what your story on
the mail server

215
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:31,779
perfectly acceptable I can sniff it

216
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:35,899
but I can't look at Walt stored in my
mail server and then there's the

217
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:41,029
if you're accessing your own stop so
theoretically

218
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:44,100
rise in for example holding your data

219
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,790
holding your email on you cancel your
account

220
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:53,199
you could then go back and get what your
mail

221
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,119
I providers may also what the their
limited in what they can't divulge to a

222
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,790
third party

223
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,969
they can divulge content to recipient
are provide

224
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,110
are for communication which is kind of
an obvious ru like

225
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,230
we hold the state were allowed to give
it to you your the intended recipient

226
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:15,819
that's your job hired you

227
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:18,860
I'm providers may not nationally

228
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,160
default content are art

229
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,389
the fact that transmission occurred
unless there's unintelligent

230
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:30,160
weaver by the person who the risks a by
the recipient

231
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,899
also with a valid court were not it
doesn't have to be Faiza can be just a

232
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,360
regular

233
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,869
search warrant can be even a subpoena
civil subpoena

234
00:14:39,869 --> 00:14:42,980
I'm now there's a the

235
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,480
there's this in a river discovery rule
that says that

236
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,579
if I negligently if I'm an ISP

237
00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:53,499
get somehow not intentionally not
looking for

238
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:57,660
but mail from a to be talking about a
criminal act like

239
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,969
we're gonna go kills I'm the sysadmin

240
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,420
miss route and I'm reading the post
master account bounces to me

241
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,470
I'm allowed to tell see by its

242
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:11,119
sp Criminal Evidence are reasonably
death grievances

243
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:15,230
harm so it's not just hey bobby one help
me wasn't

244
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,939
tax fraud got be something serious

245
00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,309
now there's a lesser protection given

246
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:26,679
to pen register and trapping trees this
is

247
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:29,679
not content 50 this is

248
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,259
should this is where's where's the
communication

249
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:36,589
going who is from their isn't anything

250
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:39,649
specifically talking about

251
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,019
packet routing argue this

252
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:49,499
when I when I help break the white paper
3rd circuit to say

253
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:53,859
packet header information is like is
like a phone number it's like an email

254
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,089
address that you have

255
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,889
less interest privacy interest in it
because

256
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:02,629
you have to give it to someone else for
you to get the information to where it's

257
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,269
going

258
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,949
for example you email letter you have no

259
00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:11,609
right of privacy now cover up the letter
because someone has to read

260
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:15,379
to get it to where it's going

261
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,230
much the wiretap law says that

262
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,509
there's some protection on who you're
dialing

263
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:26,569
who's calling you

264
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,009
the own terms are trapped and register
trap and trace the haven't changed

265
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:33,309
even though I don't think there actually
already physical pen registers in

266
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,600
traffic trace devices anymore

267
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,189
by records names dates times

268
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:45,029
payment method headdresses main are also
protected

269
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:49,299
you can get those with the less with the
warrant that requires less probable

270
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,019
cause

271
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,239
but the unless there's a waiver

272
00:16:54,239 --> 00:16:57,529
to the ISPR the provider

273
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:02,029
they can't divulge to a third party

274
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:06,079
so providers may use this information
either with informed consent

275
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,480
so in somewhere in that 18-page contract
you signed with

276
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,679
your provider the mail this information

277
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,520
third parties on for billing purposes of
course they're allowed to see you know

278
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,839
while you mean 25 minute phone call East
yet

279
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,740
well their lead to bill you for I'm
they're also want to do it for casting

280
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,630
armenians operations service for obvious
reasons

281
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,529
and then there's this terrific how to
protect the service user

282
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:36,260
are connected networks from a legal or
abusive X

283
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,730
not really sure what that means has in
many cases on it so it's

284
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,860
out there

285
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:49,559
now when the law enforcement do a pen
registers slash track and trace

286
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,668
if it's part of a legitimate
investigation with recipients permission

287
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:59,620
so you're allowed to say I think
someone's using my telco

288
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,440
my I'm a provider their using my systems
for fraud

289
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,980
I'm allowed to book

290
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,049
medicaid I'm allowed to say packets are
coming from

291
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:16,059
a to be not allowed to look at the
content without a warrant

292
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:22,220
but I'm allowed to look at syrup
information about the information

293
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,450
any law enforcement can also get an ex
parte a were

294
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,760
basically it's that its male and judge
or magistrate finds its relevant to an

295
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,850
ongoing criminal investigation

296
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,590
very low standard you know it's no
affidavits really have to come out there

297
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,939
anything serious just

298
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,860
hey we're investigating for fraud

299
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,330
want gooseneck can go see where the pact
going

300
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,580
not contact now

301
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,649
the remote having requirements under
kaliya I'm not gonna going to call you

302
00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:52,570
can squeeze

303
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,760
by this eliminates the requirement

304
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,940
actually physically install registers
track entries

305
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,659
every communications device has to be

306
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:06,799
easily argued that that means it has to
be

307
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,379
remotely Apple with how permission
control

308
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,419
even notification a provider

309
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:19,149
spend it's being rebuffed by

310
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,220
because their such interest in this
right now

311
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,529
every manufacturer at least that I know
is making stuff

312
00:19:26,529 --> 00:19:30,130
that you can remotely with no operator

313
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,429
control because God knows your Cisco you
don't want to sell stuff that

314
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:38,220
you know your thinking total cost you
wanna make sense it's like

315
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,990
I'm siskel comply like you know

316
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,409
you know this is this is also not the
y2k problem it's gonna be the new

317
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:46,370
version

318
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,659
okay this fits all your regulatory needs
by

319
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,460
should be should be interesting to see
how that plays out I haven't seen cases

320
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,940
argument a provider can can can install

321
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,260
on kal remote wiretap compliance stuff

322
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,340
it's not limited to voice in wire it
seems to also include

323
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,309
any any kinda electronic communication
so that could be radio

324
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,678
that could be microwave its be

325
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,289
open it's just like any communication

326
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:26,129
I think it could be used to describe
sniffing headers

327
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:33,130
time the date stamp stuff like that I
don't know yet

328
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,549
okay now their civil remedies what do
you do if

329
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:41,509
you were packets gets there's this
common law

330
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:44,919
true toward intrusion into seclusion you
can get

331
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,399
damages for about twenty-two states
allow

332
00:20:49,399 --> 00:20:52,539
such action where it's and unreasonable

333
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:57,769
unwarranted intrusion into someone's
privacy

334
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:01,100
there's kinda mixed holdings on whether
or not you have

335
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,419
perfect privacy email because there's
this whole

336
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,409
well it's going to someone else use the
sender have no protection

337
00:21:08,409 --> 00:21:12,630
because the idea is that you're sending
to a third party

338
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,639
third party could send now I'm

339
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:19,100
I sent an email to be it four to ten
thousand people

340
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,960
I therefore new protection be hasn't
interest in protecting

341
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,700
incoming communications so

342
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,850
he has no standing I have no standing
I'm sending to be

343
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,909
be standings for

344
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,429
on the stored Communications Act allows
a fine

345
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:40,450
civil fine for thousand dollars per
violation

346
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,789
I haven't seen cases on yet where how
they're going to find that if thats

347
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:48,250
per packet if that's going to be per
email message

348
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,350
that's going to be well you read 1800 my
email messages

349
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,669
you thousand dollars don't know yet

350
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:58,980
um electronic wiretap act

351
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:02,769
allow civil suit against private parties
for damages but

352
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:07,049
and state agencies are in you to civil
suit on

353
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:10,529
that's why I the case against 18 he's
going

354
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:14,490
AT&T because they can say

355
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,980
we finally did your rights have a nice
day where

356
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,259
I'm gonna go in a couple interesting
cases now

357
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:28,940
about in how interceptions kinda falling
what privacy rights you have

358
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,940
in your electronic communications in the
workplace

359
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,149
home at schools

360
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:38,360
recent one guarantee John Handcock

361
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,929
you have no expectation of privacy works

362
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,669
9 even did this is this is kinda scary

363
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:48,779
is I red parts the John Hancock

364
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:52,340
manual it said you do right of privacy

365
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,740
we will not divulge any emails unless

366
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,960
they're necessary a John hancock
violates this

367
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,470
in this case in the court says that's
fine

368
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,009
so even if there's like a we're going to
give you privacy

369
00:23:07,009 --> 00:23:10,320
your privacy

370
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,799
however cover you which is kind of
equipment

371
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:18,970
um even the makes kinda felt that
wealthy do staters privacy

372
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,740
you have a privacy right however I'm
sure every employer

373
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,600
is saying you privacy right just to
protect themselves

374
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,059
hmm to kinda weird splints

375
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,668
there's a to come not cases that

376
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,259
any user can grant permission to view
website

377
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:41,990
so on have I register to use

378
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,279
a password-protected website I sign
Terms of Service

379
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,059
say Irish I will not divulge my pastor
anybody

380
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:53,428
I handed off to be who does not sign the
contract doesn't click

381
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:56,970
you know I agree and

382
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,019
website website operators as women you
die

383
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:03,149
you improperly came in its

384
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:08,230
to bed any user can grant access kinda
creepy

385
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,429
because then you could have you

386
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:16,289
you can have a disclaim its new law
enforcement come in they can come in

387
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,509
however this there's a split in this
thinking

388
00:24:20,509 --> 00:24:24,450
this kinda creepy case out Chicago

389
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,769
Citrin where they said its unauthorized
access

390
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:32,259
to use your own work laptop it was

391
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:36,389
deletion beta keys where even though you
haven't quit yet

392
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:39,450
your going to quit you've decided that

393
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:42,990
I'm not going to work for you anymore
using my work laptop

394
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,629
to start kinda feeling for other jobs
and

395
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:49,909
the owner are the sorry the authorized
user

396
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:54,389
the laptop lost their authorization to
use it for the quick for the employees

397
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:57,710
you and the

398
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:02,039
civil charges kinda scary because it's I
don't know what this means is completely

399
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,480
in flocks

400
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,889
will probably take ten years from just
wash so

401
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:09,970
right now kinda scary

402
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,120
the PK's going on right now changes that
whole

403
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,820
intersection problem I talked about
councilman

404
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,960
is a for circuit thats basically New
England

405
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,759
minus Fermont pa Sport Rico

406
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:28,370
kinda true the circuit strangely

407
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,230
by whose scum

408
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:36,980
he offers free web access I'm sorry 3

409
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,419
web email packages to

410
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:43,429
people that do business with he sells
rare books

411
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,419
what he does that was he says well I'm a
provider under

412
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:51,379
stored Communications Act and why hacked

413
00:25:51,379 --> 00:25:54,629
wanna do is minutes any rights has code
written

414
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:58,450
thats out any stuff going to I'm

415
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,159
in a row so he can hold back email

416
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,919
and then make a better offer for
whatever book thereby

417
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,580
on school dot-com era but you think it's
kinda creepy when

418
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,549
yeah I want to buy this rare book gonna
get a better price like

419
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,059
you know or less from the guise of from
email

420
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:21,850
how do you know what I want book so they
go and complain

421
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,610
to it's the feds come in and say
overcharging you

422
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:28,919
interception he's thinking I'm safe
because

423
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,009
I grad Mike on system

424
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:36,490
and the effectively the fed's get a
conviction anyway

425
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,549
kinda through everyone watching this cuz
its no

426
00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:44,230
store communications wiretap bounced
around the courts

427
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,909
a the the appellate

428
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,230
the Appellate Division the appellate
court said no

429
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,399
its we're gonna hold Steve Jackson

430
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:58,720
and have where all were all the judges
answer

431
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,559
Consett me here the hear the case he
said no

432
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,360
you got the email before intended
recipient it's now interception

433
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,559
changed everything has not yet been
followed

434
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,720
so Steve Jackson case is still good law

435
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,720
everywhere but New England no other
circuits followed

436
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,740
but it kinda makes this interesting
split so

437
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,809
you know if your gonna do this stuff

438
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:27,799
do it somewhere else

439
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,210
and the per makes a provider protections
so much more limited we don't know where

440
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:31,820
it is

441
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,600
read that I read that and you may be
five or six times I don't know how

442
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,350
providers

443
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:39,679
see so

444
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,269
what is was all boil down to if your
provider

445
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:46,499
you can intercept some communications
your generally safe your

446
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,440
doing it for legitimate reason to
protect your own systems

447
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,980
your networks your users

448
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,330
store stuff that's in storage less
protection

449
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,658
and stuff that is being transmitted
there's

450
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,620
greater interest on the wire
communications I'm

451
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,860
it just seems to have a wall please out
on councilman still first good

452
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,049
still good law only in the First Circuit

453
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:19,049
has involved anywhere else now how do
you protect yourselves

454
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,159
get the consent users getting writing

455
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,659
either in terms of service or separate
den

456
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:31,820
if you are employees and you you happy

457
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:35,689
reason get permission from your employer

458
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,039
in writing because you won't be able to
wave at around someone complains

459
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,210
better yet have written your job
description if you have one

460
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:47,909
guests its it's a nice piece evidence
say no I'm allowed to be here

461
00:28:47,909 --> 00:28:51,509
really because there could be
convictions someone who say works on

462
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:52,259
helpdesk

463
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:55,809
says wall you know you know I decided to
just

464
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:58,908
I bought this I got you packet sniffer
wanna test

465
00:28:58,909 --> 00:29:02,610
now in fact that was a line I got from
the prosecuting attorney and Councilman

466
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,080
which said

467
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,309
you have a legitimate reason we're not
gonna prosecute but if you just wanna

468
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:08,100
play with

469
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,279
the real will come after you

470
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,820
that point I was like yeah guess I won't
be doing

471
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,850
I'm and if you are

472
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,399
the provider if your employer have a
sniffer policy

473
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:26,659
says you may when you may use this who
may use it

474
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,580
when may you use so that way
everything's really nice and clear so

475
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,809
that way

476
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:35,559
if God forbid get prosecuted are you get
sued for it

477
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:39,070
you can point to that and say we found
her own rules

478
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,980
therefore were on the clean side

479
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,980
I kinda rush through that cuz we're
running a lil bit later many questions

480
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:54,980
yeah

481
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:03,909
and I'm sir and I'll what's the other
computer if

482
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,909
you're not if you're not capturing
anyone else is packets

483
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,190
you should be okay the problem is you
think I'm gonna

484
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,870
like hot network not a switched network
you may grant packets

485
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:19,320
are yours so

486
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,309
your than up for yeah

487
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:31,309
okay

488
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,060
it's still an electronic communication

489
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,190
they've modified its in the

490
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,600
modification of the Patriot Act I
believe what they say expressly

491
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,290
mentioned

492
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:45,320
these they talk about I VOIP

493
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,560
and capital I you may not use this you
know it's a violation

494
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,760
to a new way horned blah blah blah blah

495
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,330
that seems to be a hold over to say if
you're convicted for

496
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,199
phone harassment but you can say well
it's not phone its VoIP

497
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,310
so it seems to be that any electronic
communications covered by I'll

498
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:11,310
stuff okay yeah

499
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,230
question is your security vendor you get
measured from the company

500
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,980
companies liable US sacred OKC your

501
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:54,019
third-party your each and the company

502
00:31:54,019 --> 00:31:58,009
a hard you to come in and say please
never packets okay

503
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:03,740
but they are not allowed to do I'm not
sure

504
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,039
I think you you've got some defenses by

505
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,549
even having defense is coming into this
is means you might be up for some

506
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:11,360
litigation

507
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,549
in a civil sense I think the Fed to be
less interested because you're

508
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,990
it's harder to prove the criminal case
and would be civil case I think you'd

509
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,179
wanna have some

510
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,889
as much documentation says we're doing
this for a legitimate reason

511
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:30,259
anyone else

512
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:34,810
yeah

513
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,659
you mentioned allowing party which

514
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,370
signed your terms services to allows
third-party access your website

515
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:44,620
or network let's say that you had a
Terms of Service

516
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,500
degree to everytime they logged on with
that sorry

517
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,360
I didn't hear that if you had a terms
services

518
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:55,990
that party agree to had to re

519
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:59,930
agree to every time they log on and they
allowed party see into the website

520
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:03,510
like you know the password with that
also by party see to

521
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,720
those terms services yes it could by

522
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,110
if a terrific

523
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,350
that the click track you know are and
click rapper

524
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,220
are are Opera House browser app license
it seems to be

525
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:20,440
binding however it would still not

526
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,340
if if be CP's an authorized user

527
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,430
be gives see these password and logon

528
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,150
see still bound by the contract

529
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:34,810
but they're not violating the stored
Communications Act

530
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:38,060
even though you a as that provider like

531
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,620
I don't see here you know so its kinda

532
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,760
it's kind it seems to be in flux right
now I think you had a really aggressive

533
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,040
prosecutor

534
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,159
you might be able to get something but
you realizing your terms service you're

535
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,690
also protecting yourself your

536
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:58,590
by saying if you come you may not get
your passwords you have action against

537
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,790
B&C see for coming in on authorized be
for

538
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:08,790
hanging up password thank you you
encrypt the contents of your packets

539
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,940
does that have any influence on the
expectation of privacy good question

540
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,450
there is a key out have

541
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:21,549
have I think the Southern District
Florida

542
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,340
on the case seen on this one's couple
drug dealers

543
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,050
using they're using friction over radio

544
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,060
they want said he wasn't guys is just
like voice scrambler

545
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:37,029
the court said well you listened

546
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,040
in and because you encrypt it said

547
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,790
you your subjective expectation of
privacy was dues

548
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,139
so then they allow that in wasn't

549
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:51,819
the wasn't wire it was just Street 4th
Amendment case

550
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,640
so I think you're right I think it does
reduce your

551
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:00,980
expectation of privacy ironic has been
held up

552
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,130
that memory contents are stored if it's
incidental

553
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,860
if because it seems to know X systems
per se it seems protect

554
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,160
communications I don't know

555
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,600
help for that goes have in many cases
where it's like purely machine

556
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,660
Commission communication

557
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,580
not human initiated if it's

558
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,290
if it's if it seems to be electronic
communication that's in storage however

559
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,080
incidental

560
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:35,080
then it would be protected under stored
Communications Act said

561
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,319
crypt clear

562
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,890
still prosecute 10

563
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:46,799
I'm gonna see your whose who's doing the
said use in

564
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,600
communication Sep crack

565
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:55,750
prosecutor because but it

566
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,810
what's the evidence you don't having if
it's not cracked it can't be presented

567
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,270
we have you know and you can you know
skill defense

568
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,990
yeah that's that's you know 18 por not
legal

569
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,470
thank you still continue mystic yes yes

570
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,790
yes they could well they couldn't
prosecute they would arrest you and I

571
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:20,970
you and then wait until the cracked if
your network with and

572
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,210
bpm connection that is

573
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,300
servicers with your network are you
allowed

574
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:33,200
packets their traffic your who are your
provider

575
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,400
you you own the land but you offer
employees or something

576
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,970
but someone employees should have access

577
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,250
gains access and you try packets their
traffic over the

578
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:50,700
I think your project under whole
defensive your network rule

579
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,750
that says that while you're on
authorized user therefore I'm doing this

580
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,900
to make sure that my systems are not
being used to

581
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,410
fractional you know for fraud abuse and
to defend

582
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,279
other systems because you're you know
your land theoretically is connected to

583
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,740
the rest

584
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,690
internet so you could then say no

585
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,740
I'm allowed I'm allowed to look at the
content of these packets because

586
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,590
I'm protecting my self so

587
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:24,180
University sir

588
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,960
the students for Sensible Drug campuses
decides

589
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,430
traffic to look for crimes resist the
mall

590
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,169
yep you

591
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,700
just connection months at a time

592
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:44,240
just campus this comes down from
higher-ups

593
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,580
if it is a private network actually just

594
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,069
State University then mines Fourth
Amendment

595
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,510
due process and for I'm sorry mines

596
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,120
Fourteenth Amendment Due Process also
implies

597
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,650
fourth amendment that you had
unreasonable search however given

598
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,250
its University somewhere in the terms
service there may be a

599
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,930
we allow we're allowed to sniff whatever
we want whenever we won

600
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:18,930
if there wasn't I think you have a key

601
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,560
space wifi its it's still

602
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,110
electronic communications so sniffing
Wireless

603
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:33,280
70 miles connection with the same
sniffing a wired connection

604
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,990
you some part in the wiretap says stuff
that is

605
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,130
broadcast with the intent of being
generally received

606
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:44,200
and it seems to be more imply radio like

607
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,520
than a.m. shortwave that there's no you
know

608
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,110
on ninety 1.7 college radio broadcasting
you listen

609
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,560
well that's kinda hinge by if it's

610
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,970
if it's a if its electronic
communication that your not

611
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:02,880
arguing is were widespread consumption

612
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,630
you would then have some protection

613
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:13,630
yeah

614
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,980
this is this is wireless there is that

615
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,260
seems exception says your allow to sniff

616
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,619
content to you find out sources

617
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:36,680
interference for your network I think
the

618
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,730
still women because it's you can sniff

619
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:46,069
18 packets to figure out somethings
interfering with I think

620
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:50,349
there some you know some reasonable yes
I don't know yet but

621
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:57,349
that's how I that's how I would

622
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:05,770
yet

623
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,820
yeah use my if you're

624
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,890
organization acceptable use

625
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,220
is extort

626
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:19,320
if you

627
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,300
what you want to do is in your UP our
Terms of Service you wanna have

628
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:28,630
the can look track you won't have that
protection

629
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,420
clearly its looking for violations the
terms

630
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,950
service different what we're looking I'm

631
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,680
not sure if I'm I'm being clear on that
you wanna have we are allowed to look at

632
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:40,940
your

633
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,990
if your use of our network presumes
we're allowed to look at yourself

634
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,880
you won't have that wine there more than
just were looking for

635
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,710
violations abuse because the you seem to
be

636
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,120
it seems to be more narrowly defined it
seems to be:

637
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,859
fraudulent abusive

638
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:03,670
like if someone's when your network by

639
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,380
by you know doing packets for that would
be

640
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,400
that would be acceptable if it's you
don't like that

641
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:14,520
for the call the conservative college
its it might be a violation

642
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:18,410
service you advocate for

643
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:24,210
for it three-drug society but it might
not be still

644
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:28,790
finally your privacy rights here

645
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:33,529
is see

646
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:36,720
see monitor

647
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,640
for I think you could argue that it's

648
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,940
you're preventing abuse or fraud and
shrug your shoulders and say look

649
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,100
think it might be you might be doing
fraudulent use said

650
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,370
think

651
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:59,089
I think so I you get it in writings that
we've got a far better defense to say

652
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:03,140
told you we could do with their for your
use a wave versus then

653
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,160
this sort of like we're looking for
abuse good someone to

654
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,049
argue well is use things

655
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:16,590
you are sir

656
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:20,680
weren't which here it seems

657
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,859
there's a key recent case it seems you
too because it's a violation

658
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,960
due process you however only talk to
that boy

659
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,570
you can you can't call up user that's
being

660
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:38,120
has you know if you're if you're nice P

661
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,890
we want to look at your user you can't
call say

662
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:46,060
a you should hire you can hire a word if
you're you comply with the order but I

663
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,120
don't think you can

664
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,859
inform anyone else but I don't know if I

665
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:57,860
this kind of weird I don't you know what
I don't know about Canadian

666
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,280
I think approaches everything so

667
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,490
I believe it seems to be the other
nations laws

668
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,430
seem to be other than europe seem to be
mirroring

669
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:34,569
US their or European EC directives came
down

670
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,810
much much stronger on privacy I'm
starting to think

671
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,110
you to host any servers posted somewhere

672
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:47,710
anything else

673
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:54,710

674
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,500
