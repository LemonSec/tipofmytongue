equipment come in phnom

73
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,880
5-6 hours late during setup which made
getting it all done a lot harder

74
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,750
but I think it's still pretty much
worked and i wanna plug once again

necessarily need to mention things like
wacky or I

307
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:26,670
you know on sets and then later they
they appreciate the feedback

308
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,400
and as always my goal for this
conference is try to be in multiple

309
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:36,400
places at once I'm still working on

310
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,330
yeah and this hotel really makes it
possible me were here in the middle of

311
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,259
New York City

312
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:48,549
and is really is an possible to do
something like what we do every couple

313
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:49,059
of years

314
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:53,029
I mean right in the middle of Manhattan
with traffic going by three in the

315
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,580
morning

316
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,600
I may be hung out a upstairs and watch
the thunderstorm last night saying all

317
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,340
New York City

318
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,570
in front of the its its beautiful I'm
just glad this place is here and I'm

319
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:02,809
glad we can still afford it

320
00:32:02,809 --> 00:32:09,809
so let's hope it doesn't get renovated
too much

321
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:19,350
now I'm there is business to take care
of and I I believe Mike you have

322
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,700
you have a computer program that that we
came upon that

323
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,110
knows answers to things sorry

324
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:32,670
giving it bring them a couple is low

325
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:37,620
okay %uh so some as you may recall that
last year we wrote a very kind of

326
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,870
Aki a shell script to give out door
prizes this time we planned the whole

327
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,990
you know hour in advance and wrote some
very sophisticated

328
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:48,740
a C code to help us determine the
important question uva

329
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,380
who is number one so I don't know if all
you can see this but hopefully summer

330
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,480
camp before

331
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,940
are okay yeah that's the program that
that that'll do it

332
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,390
yeah it's very very sophisticated RA

333
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:05,600
so we actually tested at the bar debt it
works with what you're saying is that

334
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,760
this program

335
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:11,800
not only will pick number one yeah but
guarantees that no one is actually in

336
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,920
the room because

337
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,460
the from what I can see it that could
generate a number somebody

338
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,610
never even got a bandage on on on out
its it's tested its divulged

339
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,760
forgot your gonna

340
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,820
for possibly say well okay you know so
the kids are you sure you know if you

341
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,350
doing

342
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,940
yeah the week before before we actually
reveal

343
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,660
I we're number one is I this one express
my personal thanks because without

344
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,690
number one we would not be able to any
of this

345
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,450
and we all owe so much in the way of
thanks gratitude

346
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:48,010
and just heartfelt inspiration to

347
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,490
that which we all know is there and

348
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:56,420
Hannah and who is to say it I know how
is to %uh to express my heartfelt thanks

349
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,270
but I think we all deserve a round of
applause for

350
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:07,270
number one now

351
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:15,260
numbers 1721 1720 1721

352
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:23,350
that's you a round of applause for
number one

353
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:33,230
I

354

387
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,530

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,869
RFID while its really

391
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,160
really slick I don't know if they're
vegan while it or not but they will help

392
00:37:59,160 --> 00:37:59,930
protect your

393
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,270
you your private information from on
RFID cards

394
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:07,079
from a getting into the hands of people
you don't trust

395
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,740
and lastly art on a media they were

396
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,089
not a really a technical book bookseller

397
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:17,460
but they had a lot to really a
alternative titles

398
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,180
there's one I'm I'm

399
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,529
know we like to mix would like to mix it
up here hope so I've

400
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,680
got a budget I i'm sorry also the table

401
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,440
I would like to mix up the very centrist
gets different communities together

402
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,050
and that they don't need a lot a book so
we've got a big pile a swaggering be

403
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,770
given on em

404
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,800
we can give it away

405
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:46,800
we should give it all to number one

406
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:55,390
you know it away him down might do you
have a

407
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:01,348
another program that might work for this
I

408
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,180
okay yeah we have a sums especially
special

409
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,348
things and and I think that make sense
to do away

410
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:13,220
and a we can maybe use the same sorta

411
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,599
I

412
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,700
happen

413
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,839
we do know how to use computers around
here right ISO

414
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,750
what bernie where to go %uh so we have

415
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,099
I this this thing right here which

416
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:38,270
I Bernie can tell you what it is I don't
know it's a

417
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:45,270
a win by no Aruba excuse me i something
else in my mind on

418
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:49,970
on

419
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:54,140
the folks at Make Magazine films
specially donated a.m. a brand-new

420
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:57,640
Roomba vacuum cleaner but it's been
specially hacked

421
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,470
modified with a at up Bluetooth to
serial converter

422
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,920
and it and it's a firm has been updated

423
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,480
and is a copy of the magazine Make
Magazine article on how

424
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,480
how this kit tool can be used to
basically have your own personal robot

425
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,579
that is what you wanted to do not just a

426
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,060
vacuum house this things were like three
or four hundred dollars so we gotta pick

427
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,380
somebody special for this thing

428
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,780
on listeners anybody is anybody here
that doesn't need a personal robot raise

429
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,859
your hand if

430
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:30,160
well we have to figure something else
out

431
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,420
alright so will a

432
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,540

%uh Make Magazine this is a great
magazine it's a I i think is a good

447
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,359
complement to 2600 on

448
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,500
this is really focused on a do it
yourself hardware hacking

449
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,960
with the ordinary materials you can find
around your home whatever

450
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,569
and some political stuff so it's not
even it is not an inexpensive magazine

451
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:13,680
either but it's well worth it

452
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,779
and the whole collection has a like a
great project so

for recent pledge drive and its base
keep him a single key chain device you

474
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:22,240

475
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:29,240

why we find what we find them

480
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,640
%ah we have a pretty controversial thing

481
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,319
this is a new book this coming out from
the starch press Set pro in a month

482

few weeks this is the this is the galley
copy

483
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:17,000
there's only one of these and no starch
added to really stand on its

484
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,510
head to get this book through legally as
you can imagine

485
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,640
there's some criminal federal criminal
statutes

486
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,790
specifically in title 18 section 29
which I'm

487
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:34,400
intimately familiar with that involve a

488
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,400
modification for telecommunications
instruments

489
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:44,400
for the unauthorized access to
telecommunications services

490
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,550
and the this book this this on is galley
here has

491
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:57,940
some content that is likely to be
stricken after the FF lawyers are done

492
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,480
saying

493
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,830
well you gonna go to jail if you publish
it this way so

494
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:05,970
this is really a unique fries we wanna
pick somebody who

495
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:09,670

love them and they both come with the
two identical keys

595
