as an alternate entertainment system
mobilize the value of goal

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,110
for internet payments the gold is 100
percent backed by reserve a physical

12
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,610
gold

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:02,000
stored been recognized repositories on
the way I like to explain it is that

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,369
think it is ppl backed by goal and not
to I'm

15
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,670
Federal Reserve Notes or the

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,330

American

17
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,750
so are

18
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,470
go to virgin didn't just start

19
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,039
thank

20
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:29,190
I did his name is Venkat and his company
is Ray servers dot com

21
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,570
RT y SCR bers dot com

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,850
I'm one of the older merchants with

23
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,850
that use e-gold I was actually

24
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,000
arm hired by the company that became

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,170
separate from Eagle while eagle was to
apartment

26
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,399
and I've been with them ever sense the

27
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:52,860
the gold really is there it really is
pretty

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,380
safe but it's only as safe as you keep
your passphrase

29
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,440
Eagle kind of demands that old-fashioned

30
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,509
individual responsibility thing so it's
draws

31
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:06,310
a certain kind of person I had thought
that the hacker audience would be an

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,569
easy audience to get

33
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,580
and since they were already like to pay
balance inside already been here

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,260
previously I thought that well

35
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,899
it's going to be easy just to get these
guys to you something that treats them

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,670
like adults

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,290
but some gamble let's go see porn
doesn't care about

38
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,019
you know anything as long as its not
gonna draw down the government wounds

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,750
like young child born is obviously out
murder incorporated

40
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,870
they would frown upon that buddy gold
doesn't really care

41
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,180
about a lot of what you folks do

42
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,290
that control freaks do care about

43
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,440
and so it draws a community very much
like this community in this community

44
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,300
should harness the power of the gold
because

45
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,290
in my heart this community is very close
to me I really like a spot

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,820
were a lot better on free speech now we
are free markets

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,519
and that can lead to poverty and you got
to be good at both

48
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,310
and we're losing that got a couple
examples of the United States coinage

49
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,850
and what van cats gonna talk about is
how the constitution and your money has

50
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,570
been hacked

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,040
as the greatest actor risk racquetball
time basically

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,859
your money has been cracked and this is
what your money should look like

53
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,950
a gold or silver coin and if you read
the Constitution

54
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,870
if you read the Bible if you liked it or
I instead if you like the koran instead

55
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,700
it doesn't matter all OVA mention

56
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,820
what money really is but a lot of people
you've you've learned about money since

57
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,940
you were very young

58
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,690
and so you think you know what money
really isn't we really start studying

59
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,220
money

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,120
and then suddenly you realize just how
bad things have gotten and at this point

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,600
a buncha people with basically the
electronic version of a printing press

62
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,200
have fooled everybody into thinking that
the dollar

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,290
is still backed by something other than
faith in you know

64
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:54,380
credit and all that it's not it used to
be backed by something sort of

65
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,220
but it's just not anyway and %uh for me
and

66
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,720
it's not it's it's a weirdly political
and a political subject

67
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,130
he called isn't a political thing it's
just money but it's a base upon which

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,549
other forms %uh really cool money can
exist

69
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,730
and do exist already and so I encourage
you to try it out

70
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,039
Anchorage you to read more about it and
if you have any questions

71
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:24,039
later ask near him make a so it's a
pleasure to be here

72
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,220
%ah I didn't expect to be here in just
three weeks ago

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,020
I Jim give me a call in time

74
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,789
there's this thing 2600 akers

75
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:42,900
cont offer them and I said

76
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,690
what me after hackers and I'm

77
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,750
I so if you're sure we are

78
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,090
giving your presentation I

79
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,610
lot of cool things have happened the
last four years I'm Reserve is a small

80
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,240
company

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,850
be I'm tried to do the online merchant
thing

82
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,290
we took credit cards for two days

83
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,620
got twenty thousand dollars in arms

84
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,680
you very happy and every one of them
most problem

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,450
ok I so if you hear on this thing that
e-gold

86
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,400
has a lot of fraud in a try credit cards

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,480
okay so we were looking for

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,240
a payment solution where when we got
paid restate be

89
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,960
and I also been following you gold

90
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,070
I'm pleased to have this cool little
slogan I'm I have infused

91
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,800
slides down gold itself electronically
circle even they don't have that anymore

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,870
it's a shame

93
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,220
%uh and I what they promise

94
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,850
is I'm irreversible payments and that is
true

95
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,650
I'm few on her laptop from siberia

96
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,510
and you barely gonna be happy to ship it
to you I don't need to know who you are

97
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,430
I know that I've gotten paid and I was
the baby and that's what was

98
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,470
important to me when I started this

99
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,000
sense that %uh I'm as I'm jim says

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,460
monies that if fun little topic

101
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,560
I have looked into money for the last
four years

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,880
and come away with some very interesting
conclusions

103
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
and also the state of

104
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,120
operating systems

105
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,270
know we have some very nice technology
today I

106
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,889
I deal with security on the time you
know we've got

107
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,280
Linex finally an open source free market
sort of an operating system as opposed

108
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,310
to

109
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,820
the Gippy Grewal portion of an operating
system the National name

110
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,909
I and we also have

111
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:51,169
by on all thought so far security issues
that have come up on the internet denial

112
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:52,460
of service attacks

113
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,210
spam and what has interested me

114
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,630
is act the economic aspect of security

115
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,630
opening on the next time

116
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,350
so yes beyond give thanks to the unknown
hacker I like to be thought of as a

117
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,770
closet hacker I don't do this and in
public

118
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,890
but yeah I am in front of everybody else
and

119
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,640
they are a number of people without
which I wouldn't be in business

120
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,870
I'm can think of Richard Stallman

121
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,480
who was there the other day so many
others linares

122
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,000
and how so we have some amazing
technology we have

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
open source secure

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,690
operating systems and not could lead to
things like self extending wireless

125
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,600
networks

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,680
which the technology exists and talk
about secure operating systems

127
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,100
and talk about encryption onion routing

128
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,000
or and mixMeister and how

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,630
money can't I'm to these things some
life on the Internet today

130
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,500
you all have experience spans fam comes
to your inbox you don't want it it's

131
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,130
there

132
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,930
and its I'm then you have denial of
service attacks

133
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,240
e-gold if you go to their site you see
there's a small little things says

134
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,160
Prolexic on their they were taken off
the air by a bunch of people

135
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,170
who just something so much information
that it calls an overload

136
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,580
on the pipe to their summers and

137
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,950
I am this is called the Tragedy of the
Commons if you study done little but if

138
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,700
I'm

139
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,090
economic history and

140
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,979
its cause by the fact that it is free to
send email

141
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,410
and free to send a packet once you
connected to the Internet

142
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:47,500
you are basically saying I would receive
as many packets is you will send me

143
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,820
and I'm free therefore to send you

144
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,850
backups and since there's no cost to it

145
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,680
there's no cost to having

146
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,540
insecure operating systems connected to
the Internet and

147
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,750
and people taken or and cam launch

148
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,860
a distributed denial of service attack
against you and if you want to stay on

149
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,640
the air

150
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,340
you have to pay for the traffic and
that's what I am

151
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,860
denial of service I prevention

152
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,430
is all about you need fat bikes and what
it means for

153
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,610
the small guy is that if you cannot
afford to pay five ten thousand dollars

154
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,170
a month

155
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,219
and then charges you can be on the air

156
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,530
and therefore we need

157
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,829
I an Internet where you can

158
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,750
regularly the amount of I'm traffic that
goes

159
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,180
I'll get to that in a minute then
there's content filtering

160
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,020
you have 0 bit encryption

161
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,819
it's called HTTP K

162
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,910
set out I you people who are interested
in freedom of speech and freedom of

163
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,370
content and so forth and then we use a
shitty be all the time

164
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,370
so we know who is looking for Wat

165
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,640
and governments have unlimited power

166
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,270
to examined and regulate what you see
and

167
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,340
the state of the internet as we have it
today well

168
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,680
have changed and it is changing before
our eyes is changing YouTube economic

169
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,450
aspects

170
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:22,480
and due to the security and on

171
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,790
Anna content monitoring aspects

172
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,980
you can seat or starting up and we have
fishing website said look just like

173
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,760
the website you think you were a and
then you have credit card fraud

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,140
if in 1850 %um proposed that time you
gonna have to see long account number

175
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,580
plus you know the expiration date and so
forth is just a long string of digits

176
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,530
and you give it to a march in and then
the margin would have freedom

177
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,270
to charge only what you purchase

178
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,720
now that would be a joke back fam you

179
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,910
wouldn't trust the martian but not pop

180
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,250
and that's what we have online internet
purchases with credit cards

181
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:09,090
you're trusting the margin not to
overcharge you bank most margins are

182
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,890
honorable

183
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,630
and unfortunately it puts too much and

184
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:18,020
in possession of disinformation which is
very valuable to criminals

185
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,439
namely not string of digits the credit
card number expiration date shipping

186
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,170
address

187
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,610
whatever it takes to movie value to that

188
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:30,370
and that is why as a small business you
saw something about it on the internet

189
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,060
small businesses are the ones that be
from the fraud because week on 24

190
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,850
a credit department changed on see you
are who you are

191
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:45,850
and that you truly did order that laptop
so I'm gonna talk briefly about profit

192
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,860
in economics

193
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,560
and the security implications of such
things

194
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,320
so I let's say you had a a cop

195
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,070
I hate he had a farm and you have this
colony at feed hay

196
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,290
and so forth and provided you milk if

197
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,069
the cost of the Haiti was more than what
you would get

198
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,839
for the milk but you sold you would go
on business

199
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,270
but how would be beef pretty soon

200
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,189
okay and %ah we have to talk about
private property

201
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,580
and the Tragedy of the Commons private
property is

202
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,390
my backyard is my backyard you may not
raise your sheep on a

203
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,520
okay if you have the

204
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,449
Internet as we stand today and you
connect to the internet

205
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,070
you're saying that anyone can send
anything to you

206
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,480
garbage thats

207
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,980
a denial of service attack information
is power

208
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,459
and do current state of the internet

209
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,160
his very valuable to governments because

210
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,230
be happy absolutely enormous access to
information

211
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,120
they know wat you're talking about me
know

212
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,040
who is talking with whom so even if you
do take the trouble to use pgp email

213
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,280
the very fact not two people are in
communication

214
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,060
could be a problem

215
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,520
which isn't addressed by something like
Mixmaster

216
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,990
I Mixmaster not SourceForge not not go
to Reno Nevada

217
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,270
if you haven't done so already it's rare
time you do

218
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,839
onion routing on email and I'm

219
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,070
problem with Mixmaster is that it
requires

220
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,580
on depends on people giving away

221
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,630
man and it gets abused by spammers

222
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,470
so that makes masa network is basically
gone be fun P just a very few knowns

223
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:44,390
left

224
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,350
abuse the privilege you know

225
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,500
do you hear about up forty million
credit card numbers

226
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,370
were stolen you hear that I am

227
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:02,630
such and so is looking in on your
communications

228
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:06,880
now the taps 18 Kiev's given away your
information

229
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,100
who you callin and so forth so the
security improved

230
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,560
implications of the economic aspect of
fun

231
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,959
the Internet our own all around us

232
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,100
spin so

233
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,560
which brings us we follow the trail
follow the money

234
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,770
the greatest track of all time so now
what you see in the chart

235
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,860
is a choc made by the sky %uh

236
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,010
my camcorder I don't know who he is but
he hangs out on the Eagle Nest

237
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,040
and I'm I requested him to provide me

238
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,930
I'm this chart that you see which is the
dow goals

239
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,910
the dow Jones Industrial Average
measured in ounces of gold

240
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,240
that's the blue line the yellow line
that you see there

241
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,940
is the ostensible value of the dollar

242
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,070
as a percentage of wanted was defined

243
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,060
and I guess it was a 70-92 mean to act

244
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,950
back then the donor was around twenty
dollars to the house

245
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,810
can you see the flatline and then you
see that time step

246
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,280
coming down that was when it was
devalued to thirty-five dollars

247
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,689
the ONS and then you see that line
proceed all the way to

248
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:20,940
1971 hundred-dollar stealing from gold

249
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,280
and it fell all the way down 25 percent

250
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,990
of its original on as measured in grams
known

251
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:32,130
are councils have gone the blue line
that you see there

252
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,939
is the stock market how many ounces of
gold does it take to purchase

253
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,150
the doc okay but as that

254
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,760
equal in number she has two cream
Composite Index

255
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,660
so you see the slime it's got three the
blue lines got a few peaks

256
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,520
and when you look at that and you think
the money supply

257
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,310
and you see why is there a peak

258
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,449
is because and the government creates
money the first thing it does

259
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,020
is chase assets the assets

260
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,850
in this case are stocks people who are

261
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,140
creating cash for stocks our early
trading

262
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,510
one form of money for another form of
money okay

263
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,079
so the question what is money is a very
interesting question

264
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,760
and I'm I could spend weeks talking
about that

265
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,750
and everyone you talk to thanks to the
know what money is

266
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,060
how many of you here have fun had the
experience being taught in public

267
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,910
schools

268
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,939
what money is

269
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:38,870
okay and what do they teach you

270
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,199
I like some traction here

271
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,420
get group exchange

272
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:53,420
okay it's a medium of exchange that's a
good thing

273
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,329
okay great cents an hour if am we

274
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,980
exchange the two kinds of money

275
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,610
here I have a balk on my pocket and you
have

276
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,339
about a laptop right you decide to do a
train

277
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,220
you hand me the laptop and I hand you
the gold coin you made a trade

278
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,420
you've agreed upon the one ounce price
for that laptop

279
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,930
you do the trade is mutually beneficial
you now Boehner them roll call in and

280
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,630
I'm now

281
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,610
the owner of the laptop great the strain

282
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,500
so now that same we had would have what
it is today mock 630 dollars

283
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,040
I'm what it costs to buy land laptop

284
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,950
so I had 26 on thirty dollars behind me
the laptop

285
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,480
is it the same thing

286
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,530
why

287
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,760
rhyme and is one more thing

288
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,440
the first transaction the second
transaction how many how many parties

289
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,030
they were too

290
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,210
you to these two transactions the first
case with gold going to just two

291
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:01,800
people involved in the trade you guy
with a laptop

292
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,810
money changes hands in this case the
goal calling the laptop in his hands

293
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,830
the case in the paper you're using the
paper issued by

294
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,419
hard party so the third party comes into
it bank

295
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,240
so the full faith and credit United
States government comes that finished

296
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,780
we all know how much that's what these
days so

297
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:26,610
if I'm and to do anything today I would
like to leave you

298
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,610
with some questions but you have to ask

299
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,150
if you look at the strikes a fairly long
time chart stuff from 1900

300
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,820
and goes to now ruffling was actually
born January or Feb 2006

301
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,909
and why doesn't do

302
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,940
what a dunce and discharge as a question
for which

303
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,100
I'm not going to give you more than a
hand to finance their

304
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,410
you can look at the shock and Super Bowl
impose upon a

305
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,300
hi all the historical events in the last
century

306
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,500
and maybe get a glimpse of what is to
cop

307
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,800
okay and you can also you

308
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,230
read the history of money in bank
lending United States by

309
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:12,160
Mario Rockmart it's a fascinating book I
am

310
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,210
kinda dry if you're not interested in
money but it's the history in the last

311
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,820
100 years or so

312
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,500
maybe a little little more without the
politics

313
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,920
and just the money and you can read
between the lines

314
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,370
and remember what what you talkin
history and connect the dots

315
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:35,990
the money that drives the politics not
the porn pics drives the money

316
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,880
suit comes back to Eagle you go let's go
let's South electronically circulated

317
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,190
and it's a hot you two were simple
payment system

318
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,070
they have an automation interface there
you can actually set up an account

319
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,689
manner you can create a secondary

320
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,700
digital currency backed by Eagle

321
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,000
why would you want to do that because
someone can redeem

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,090
that currency that you have created

323
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,330
into you gold so you people crusty gold
more than they will trust your currency

324
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,669
so that redemption might be an automated
be

325
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,510
for you to prove that you've got mile
quote-unquote

326
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,890
in your account K so I'm

327
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,320
pretty good next likely my friend
Patrick

328
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,070
he has created the site knows a few
laptops and wireless can go check it out

329
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,820
loom .cc some interesting site

330
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,770
time he independently of me came up with
the Sun

331
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,300
concept of using strong random numbers

332
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,070
which he calls locations at which to
screw me some

333
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:49,439
gold okay and the ocean of gloom that
you see there on that site

334
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,720
uses the hash of apostrophes generate a
128 bit

335
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,830
number at which to go list or gang

336
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,419
so you can create strong random location

337
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,590
to put values about location

338
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,639
sOooo I am it's a interesting way of
creating

339
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,830
irreversible transactions it to

340
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:15,189
start of models the gold coins Tanner
okay

341
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,250
you go to the margins and you purchase
microphone

342
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,980
and you go to checkout counter reset
wanna buy this thing so

343
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,059
stands at says one ounce

344
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,270
she take your own skyline anyplace in on
the I'm

345
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,639
counter just a common shared

346
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,700
location so to speak in physical space

347
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,870
merchant picks it up and put it in its
cash to

348
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,960
so it is gone from your private location
in your wallet

349
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,860
to a shared common location on the table

350
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,320
and then mood to the cash no okay so
this is exactly what you can do with

351
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,000
loom

352
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,670
so I am loom is

353
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:59,440
tiered on top of another currency one
NBC

354
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,210
if you go to one and the C dot com snot
on the slide but per

355
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,990
its of its on my site one MDC is

356
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,390
just lucky goal is not as complex as
Patrick's

357
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:17,059
or as you say Patrick's a simpler in
some sense %uh

358
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:21,170
yes one numeral one

359
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,410
okay you cannot 1 and the C dot com
numeral one

360
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,480
and I'm this is guy J teaming

361
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,200
and I know a lot of people who have
stood constable value in its currency

362
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,550
he doesn't have a User Agreement it's
just

363
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:40,928
reputation so he has a reputation

364
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,120
for keeping your money safe how
trustworthy stop

365
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,170
it is like Shire here's

366
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:51,700
announce a gold can you store it for me
for trust him

367
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,130
well I trust him okay so

368
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,320
this trust involved in any transaction
where you store money

369
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,629
it someone else this trust in walled and
storing money

370
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,580
at a big bank let's say you bank with
Citibank you gone

371
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:13,389
put your hard-earned dollars there you
expect them to keep it safe

372
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,090
do them

373
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,820
if you know what the cash reserve ratio
is and if you knew that

374
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,110
for every dollar on deposit bill and out
I'm

375
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,610
close to a hundred dollars you before it

376
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:32,050
okay I'm the total

377
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,419
savings and checking account value

378
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,120
the United States is five points
something trillion dollars

379
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,330
and its back by about forty-five

380
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,720
or 43 I think it's coming down million
dollars

381
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,960
so far every hundred dollars you have
one deposit

382
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,309
they have about 93 sacks

383
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:57,059
FDIC insured so to bang goes down the
cute you get not perform

384
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,270
a piece of paper and hope for the best
and the federal reserve magically comes

385
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,980
to rescue print out some fresh money in
hand it to you

386
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:08,110
so that's the full faith and credit of
the

387
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,380
United States and it's up it's a fun
topic it gets political ric rac someone

388
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,530
gonna

389
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:16,760
but I'll go back to speaking about lumen
how that would tie

390
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,820
in to creating visible cash

391
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,710
okay everyone hears heard about regular
on digital cash

392
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,650
peter is the certificate signed you need
PGP keys kinda thing

393
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:31,760
and it's very complicated and only

394
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,720
a hacker could use money now ordinary
people con

395
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,690
Madrid Patrick's currency you can have
practically

396
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,290
anonymous cash by using the strong
random

397
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:49,420
locations for store a value announcing
it with another layer on top of that

398
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:53,900
you could create walloped which
maintains and keeps track

399
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,530
of the strong random locations okay

400
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,540
and not wallet could look just

401
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,850
like be about okay

402
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,820
behind the scenes now these individual
coins

403
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,929
okay you could do a payment system went
to wallets

404
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:15,250
talk to one another so if I

405
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:18,870
were to trade you you had let's say US
dollars

406
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:22,590
in the moonlight currency you had gold
in the moonlight currency

407
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,699
and we wanted to do a million dollar
trade

408
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,210
usually there's a problem you want two
million dollar trade you trust the other

409
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:29,840
guy

410
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,980
the guy who pays for first is at risk

411
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,290
got base first nothing I could say sorry

412
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,000
and I don't know you and oh the internet
that is a problem

413
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,630
but with the sort of %uh I wanna
construction you can actually do it

414
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,390
without putting

415
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,220
the entire amount at risk what you do is
you put

416
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,650
that's a a dollar at the time and I
don't want to be gone

417
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:55,710
the other direction so the two on let's
talk to each other

418
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,860
in hand receipt back to the other one

419
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,230
saying yup I got known yup I got

420
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,710
dollars short of gold so you can
actually do

421
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,600
transactions high-value transactions
without putting them on Pinterest and

422
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,240
without the need of a NASCAR

423
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,150
okay so what I just said also can be
translated to

424
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:20,810
selling laptops K

425
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:24,540
so how do you do that you can take a
laptop Scott

426
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,540
monument sits with a thousand dollars
you can sell

427
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,610
shares in a laptop one dollar a share

428
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,030
anyone who shows up with house in shares
Moxley laptop

429
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:38,760
soon you can create a market

430
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,760
peer to peer missin market of

431
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,100
I'm laptops houses

432
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,850
boats you can do that but strong random
numbers

433
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:54,530
game so how this is becoming on us

434
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:57,670
can become anonymous by putting tall or
or

435
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,330
and the 100 Layer in between the user

436
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,280
and the the wallet that is maintaining
the store about

437
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,889
let's erase it was issues laptops those
laptops

438
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,330
are on an old run by resellers

439
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,919
and we don't care

440
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,660
who shows up with a thousand shares and
takes a laptop

441
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,460
so we are happy to take whatever 1000
the price in the laptop is from the

442
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,440
first guy

443
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,750
who shows up so you can have a savings
account nominated in laptops

444
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,150
okay so this laptop is for a future
diary

445
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:38,660
it's for delivery in January of 2007 so

446
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,670
there you go and if I can pre sell
nothing

447
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:45,620
I've done one more thing is that I've
now got

448
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,630
cash flow K

449
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,080
so this is powerful stop it's the
futures market can be modeled

450
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,090
with from random numbers okay

451
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,880
so if you why and why am I here talking
to you

452
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,350
telling you all this to much for hackers
the campus make this

453
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,980
into reality okay and if 10 people

454
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,730
make ten different goal currencies make
it a reality

455
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,800
great and as jim says if

456
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,860
more Eagle worsens spring up

457
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,800
grated bring some competition to makes
them get better

458
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,470
competition is what brings us new things
all the time

459
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,510
you walk into a grocery store am look at
a variety of choices that you have in

460
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,330
front of you

461
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,820
sign out not his choice should I spend
my dollar

462
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,710
on serial mo fresh vegetables

463
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,470
you know fifteen different kinds of so
i'm ok you know I mean he's just

464
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:44,990
that the varieties amazing and people
tell you that

465
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,430
and I'm politics you have a choice don't
believe that

466
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,590
the free market is what gives you choice
in politics you're forced to make

467
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,220
perfect

468
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,580
feet choice Charles

469
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,220
citing I'm not gonna get into politics
but a stick to the free market

470
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,390
and free speech so now I have a strong
random number location

471
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,190
you could store encrypt the data doesn't
have to be

472
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,290
money things gang

473
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:18,080
so if you were to hand off music file
somebody

474
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,649
you just have to reveal the location
where you put it

475
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,070
okay so it is away by which you can have
economic

476
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,210
economically viable Sharon economically
viable tor

477
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,460
K that are known as happy each other for
the traffic

478
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,820
and they get paid intern by the user's

479
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,310
the door system right now users in the
door system

480
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:44,490
are far in excessive number

481
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,380
them does who demanded and also don't
need mandatory

482
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,700
to it out of this feeling of good well

483
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,680
promoting free speech and so on okay so
now if you can make it

484
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:01,400
profitable to run a corn on imagine what
would happen

485
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,010
you would have an enormous and and no
animus

486
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:09,879
and cryptid internet

487
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,610
would you guys like that would you guys
like to soar

488
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,450
and no one would know who you are and
what you're looking at

489
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:23,320
and it provides benefits for the
providers of content

490
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,770
you could set up a website and no one
needs to know where your servers are

491
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,760
stick on coming shut you down okay

492
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,879
you could do things like data storage

493
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,030
on the Internet which is paid you can
arrange for the

494
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:44,290
trust the payment of the transfer of
data you can arrange for the payment for

495
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,730
the storage of data

496
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,400
you can do it no way that no one knows I
you are storing this information

497
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,970
and that information can be encrypt it
your private key

498
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,530
and so the person providing the data
storage

499
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,850
doesn't have to no more that you are
storing the data

500
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,380
becomes profitable for that person to
provide you

501
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,080
remote storage

502
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,030
one of the things that we sell our
secure laptops so you have this laptop

503
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:18,290
use lube as: if you wanna re about Lupe
Fiasco Lupe Fiasco SourceForge not mad

504
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,720
beautiful little module for the Linux
kernel you can create

505
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,110
a completely encrypt the laptop no
partition table even on this

506
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,280
but its tune but did not is on your
drive

507
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,389
you can have someone show up with a
Robles is called rubber hose decryption

508
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,450
no beat you on to lead you give them the
password on the USB stick or whatever it

509
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,230
is

510
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:43,310
but if your data is just out there

511
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:48,230
you can conceivably create I'm not pick
CB

512
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,500
not boot up you type up

513
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,860
poss phrase with enough and for being a
am that

514
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,140
unlocks your wanna

515
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:02,780
which is on the Internet gets down and
you get access to your data

516
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,330
which is out there somewhere someone
storing it for you because you're paying

517
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,050
them to store

518
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,550
and you can server and no one can see
are you going

519
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,000
you you want to pay for your surfing but
actually venue

520
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,770
do this you can have robotic markets so
unknown

521
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:23,560
can charge say this known I'm creating
is going to charge

522
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,919
and milligrams of gold or and sense

523
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,660
to chart to store a gigabyte of data
time

524
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:34,850
okay and if you do not

525
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,000
another node could spring a which could
charge and

526
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,280
-1 milligrams of gold

527
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,910
okay so you can have a robotic free
markets

528
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,260
and the advantage to that is that dole's
to charge too little will go out of

529
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,110
business

530
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,120
no surcharge too much won't have people
coming to them

531
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,460
and therefore you'll get cheap

532
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,750
lowest price the best security

533
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,080
and will be economically viable security

534
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,260
me questions

535
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,509
yes weeks

536
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:17,470
and when you have questions with my
microphones with them

537
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,619
thanks very much I'm

538
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:25,489
I wanted to say I'm anonymous casually
scares the issuers have cash very much

539
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:25,989
you know

540
00:33:25,989 --> 00:33:30,399
and one says it on eagle on isn't
anonymous but obviously I think

541
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,369
I i grew thank at after 2 a.m. CC thing

542

00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,940
you could otherwise lose all agree gold
and I don't want that to happen

547
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:52,070
if you want to try it. gold for free you

551
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,409
something cuz theres

552
00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:05,330
there's a one-level referral system but
every time people start thinking about

553
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,119
this particular moment I don't want to
talk about MLM

554
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,230
I don't want to talk much but I will
know about criminals

555
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,429
I want to talk about fishing because you
know are

556
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:17,559
fissures in the worst I don't even want
to talk about ponzi schemes because the

557
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:20,409
Eagle Ponzi scheme for Ponzi himself to
shame

558
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,429
you know because people are so
economically literate and telling an

559
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,659
audience hey you guys are all
economically literate

560
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:30,540
isn't exactly popular speech you know I
can only make that kinda speech directly

561
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,960
and be that honest in front of hackers
but I'm hoping that I can

562
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,020
anyways what I really wanted to talk to
you also that I for not saying the

563
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,710
beginning is

564
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,839
pitcher you're standing in front of the
guy who could have saved Napster

565
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,129
how wall tell you how Napster

566
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:48,230
be what happened with the music business

567
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,349
is like Courtney Love's rant or
something like that you know of a

568
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:53,020
fifteen dollar CD

569
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,799
the artist maybe gets 30 or 45 cents
generally

570
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:01,040
a person who likes a song help I like a
beer the waitress gets a dollar

571
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,910
so directly connecting fans with artists
economically not just by speech there's

572
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,700
no Warner Brothers filter

573
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,359
between time warner and me if I if I can
give

574
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:16,799
you know Ted Nugent or whoever I want a
a box where the Beagle older attended a

575
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:17,700
grammy gold

576
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,339
directly then the only fees that are
taken out the only thing that's taken

577
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:25,020
out his eagle tiny feet and yes I wanna
make money I'm a greedy capitalist

578
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,839
libertarian

579
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,450
juror you know I'm I definitely want
your money and that's why I'm doing all

580
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,160
this stuff

581
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,089
and even even worse the company's not
paying me I'd pay to go do this stuff

582
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:34,549
because

583
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,420
I like actors but let's do some
interaction please come to my crib you

584
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,240
have any questions

585
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,240
no question you want I know

586
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:53,470
I can hear you

587
00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:17,309
haitians

588
00:36:17,309 --> 00:36:21,819
up there we go um to repeat for the tape
in for me as I was asking

589
00:36:21,819 --> 00:36:25,430
yes I was asking if

590
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:29,919
someone is interested in this and wants
to transfer more traditional or current

591
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,490
federally backed money

592
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:35,260
into e-gold what mechanisms are present
and

593
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,430
if you're comfortable answering what
sorta reporting to other authority

594
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,769
mechanisms are part of such a
transaction

595
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:43,859
I know for instance moving more than ten
thousand dollars around in most

596
00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:45,480
instances all logged in

597
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,079
so forth to question if you go to STATS
da de gaulle dot com right now you'll

598
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,680
see the geekiest portion

599
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,160
up the Eagle page its kind in a
heartbeat and I think the

600
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,598
biggest transaction that just happened
in the last 24 hours as 14 kilos

601
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,079
so as for reporting you know e-gold

602
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,099
is gonna go after your criminal helped
if help the fed's okay I mean if you

603
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:09,789
want to do murder incorporated

604
00:37:09,789 --> 00:37:14,039
go elsewhere alright but as far as you
know it if you're

605
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,660
same politically or selling politically
incorrect stuff they don't care

606
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,269
now how to get eagled instant
gratification Gmail Hotmail

607
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:25,019
gmail dot com and a quickie some right
away that's what are the problems with

608
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:26,059
the goal though is that

609
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:29,720
you know they were able to fling money
around my paper route 10 bucks for the

610
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,400
river and 10 bucks for the guy

611
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,630
their work there they don't have much a
marketing budget all because it's so

612
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:40,740
low fees so there are a bunch of
independent exchangers and legal doesn't

613
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,519
want to take the risk of selling

614
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:46,369
goal because that would ultimately risk
your your video stores for you

615
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,569
so there's a zillion independent
exchangers we had to use we had to break

616
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:54,019
pay pals Terms of Service with one of
them I'm not gonna say which can I don't

617
00:37:54,019 --> 00:37:54,980
wanna get him in trouble

618
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,140
in order to get here because the the
hackers wouldn't take

619
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,890
the hacker friendly currency they took
the hacker unfriendly currency

620
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,759
which is OK I mean I'm I'm struggling
through it psychologically I'm

621
00:38:05,759 --> 00:38:09,380
I'm a big failure but what's weird is
that I fail in these markets where I

622
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,839
think hot this would be easy

623
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:14,759
then I succeed things drop in my lap and
I never know what the hell I did right

624
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,210
but dice your question pretty much

625
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,920
um and if you wanted to go briefly into
asset reporting

626
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,400
oh United Rentals is in taxes everybody
is responsible for their own taxes

627
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,890
Eagle doesn't send you out any paper and
another thing I giggled is not going to

628
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,420
sell your personal information

629
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,430
to any advertiser or any sort wooden net
we're not you

630
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,990
please give them your real street
address and phone number not gonna call

631
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,339
you

632
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,500
don't wanna know you on the phone or
make other people annoy you on the phone

633
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,180
ultimately the efficiency of Eagle
micropayments might allow you someday to

634
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,390
sell your information

635
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:52,670
and who profit from it for once and that
would be a great way to initially funded

636
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,670
all accounts

637
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,549
back on paper I was starting up I used
to fund the gold accounts by having a

638
00:38:57,549 --> 00:38:58,450
Pay Pal account

639
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:02,319
and referring others in the making them
spend their initial 10 bucks to me

640
00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:06,529
but Pay Pal got wind of that in like it
too much quit doing if

641
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:12,230
thank you know from didn't the Federal
Reserve Act

642
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:16,910
when it was a Russian originally enacted
to legalize the trade-off call directly

643
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,279
for goods and services

644
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:21,509
in the United States 0 gosh

645
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:25,509
sort of a legal question but um there
were

646
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:31,609
yeah d it changed back in the carter
administration with the deregulation of

647
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,140
airlines and other new regulations but
yes there was a

648
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,078
a gold confiscation under FDR that a lot
of people think is unconstitutional on

649
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,019
now we're gonna dove into politics and I
don't really care that much about

650
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:42,980
politics was

651
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,980
I'm so I'm such a loser in politics you
know

652
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:49,839
I want free speech in economics I I
don't care about politics either I fear

653
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,558
about whether or not to go to federal
prison eventually for doing this

654
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,779
well at this point for example Osama bin
Laden is on the loose but you're safe

655
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,430
from bet on sports stock com

656
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,669
so I mean I'm scared to mention the
casinos by name but

657
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,849
take he told even though I'm well known
on the Internet by name

658
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:09,569
you know Jim ray argument is a huge fan
of a certain casino I'm sure to mention

659
00:40:09,569 --> 00:40:10,480
it anymore

660
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,170
you know if I say it here who knows them
they might want to get me

661
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,710
they arrested people in 40 not rated the
guy was stopping over for a flight in

662
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,490
Costa Rica

663
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:22,569
a UK citizen who lives in Costa Rica
some is it legal to trade

664
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:26,190
yeah it is it just you know they're
scary stuff for me Eagles been around

665
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,200
since 1996 if it were illegal

666
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,869
when they busted into the office that
was stopped for good instead the bus to

667
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:36,640
the office and started and was lawsuit
about which I cannot talk at all

668
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:43,020
okay thank you except to say that
lawyers getting way too rich off a bit

669
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:46,660
don't laugh yes %uh

670
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,058
I guess two quick questions that ur sort
of related

671
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:53,569
um one being the last time I checked the
Eagles website

672
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:56,859
which you guys did was you had some sort
of account maintenance fee

673
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:01,348
whereas what you put in money that every
month every year so much you take a

674
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:02,089
little bit out

675
00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:05,240
in order to maintain the site and so
forth do you still do this

676
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,730
correct Eagle charges two kinds of fees

677
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,619
very small storage fee to bombay from

678
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:16,500
repositories where the store and and a
very small spend feed to pay for

679
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:20,160
people like the various keeps they've
hired instead of hiring a huge marketing

680
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
department

681
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:26,049
however if you were to vote okay let's
say you started in 1996

682
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:29,240
and you had an ounce of gold any gold

683
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,410
dwindling away at 1 percent a year till
now

684
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:37,339
and you had an ounce of gold in 1996
worth of US dollars getting interest

685
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:42,150
okay compound interest for heaven sakes
in a bank since 1996

686
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,250
your head in terms of USD at this point
with the Eagles you know

687
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,509
despite all the gold horrible fees so
and some people total fees actually come

688
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:52,900
back to you in that incentive program
that I don't really want to talk about

689
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,720
because then people confusing or with
I'm an MLM thing which is not

690
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,069
%uh my second question being is that um
I respect you guys

691
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:05,430
rights make money off this obviously
because serious

692
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,250
courses business but if I go to another

693
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,440
bank opening account with the bank they
don't charge me

694
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,259
a recurring fee to keep that account
open why did you choose this

695
00:42:16,259 --> 00:42:20,020
well it instruments it did where you go
thick

696
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,970
say yeah store in gold is definitely

697
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:28,460
a a painful and dangerous thing when it
comes into 230 pounder forty pound bars

698
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,779
whenever there is a way that

699
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:34,849
yeah okay we need to stop

700
00:42:34,849 --> 00:42:38,690
alright on treasures going to take back
over

701
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,509
we would no I don't think back over to
post up thank you all for coming

702
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:46,289

jim and I will be

703
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:49,970

00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:53,299
questions with the questions out there
affect come

705
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:53,549
