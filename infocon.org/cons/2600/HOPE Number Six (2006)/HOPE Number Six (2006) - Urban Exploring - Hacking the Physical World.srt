1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,750
yeah alright

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,269
date3 a vote number six

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:14,080
couple have fun quick announcements
lockpicking is going on downstairs from

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,940
11 to three today so

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,919
if you wanna muck around with the
lockpicking I believe they're actually

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,189
selling lock picks

7
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:24,380
are the radio tass that's going on

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:28,799
on you have up until 12:30 to choose
start that because I'll

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,049
test takes about an hour and they will
be leaving at 1:30

10
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:36,180
so you to check that out that's on the
first floor RR

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,269
our next panel is urban exploring hack
in the physical world

12
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,329
are I saw these guys at the third hope
and they did a

13
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,960
a great discussion ever been exploring
every now and then to the New York Times

14
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,710
and other publications you'll see

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,210
some cool articles about urban exploring
in people that no secret entrances to

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,699
old abandoned tunnels in New York City
in even

17
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:04,589
up in Rochester in different cities that
have infrastructures that are fun to

18
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:05,600
explore so

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,090
I without further ado this is Ana John
leader

20
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:16,090
and Laura leader number 66 in 82 how you
doing we run a site called long and when

21
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:25,130
are these dot com up there on the screen
and among other things it covers urban

22
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,970
exploring on Long Island area

23
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,369
but by no means to relive it limit or
exploring to Long Island we explore all

24
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:31,820
over

25
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,400
every place we can arm like I said I am
in urban explorer that means I am an

26
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,950
active

27
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,530
trespasser of fifth trespassing is fun

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,970
it's also illegal and dangerous so I'm

29
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,439
not responsible for anything that you do
because the stalk you're responsible for

30
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,149
yourself

31
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:54,479
and any good urban explorer will have
that same opinion on the other hand I'm

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,679
also not going to condemn people who do
what I do

33
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,490
I'm not going to say that I'm only I
should do it nobody else should

34
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,700
just take your own responsibility you
can be arrested you can be heard

35
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,209
up definitions urban exploring for those
of you who don't know it I think most

36
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:10,959
have you might

37
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,300
by now because it's been getting a lot
of media attention

38
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,830
as of lately we were even on newsday
they did a whole long known life section

39
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,379
on us

40
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,470
and as articles all over each regional
area different

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,780
every exploring group um urban exploring
is the examination

42
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,500
love of women areas and more than that
I'd like to expand on this it's also

43
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,720
doesn't have to always be trespassing if
you just notice things

44
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,569
but are over Benin infrastructure around
you that most people don't notice

45
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,890
i cant that is exploring and I take a
lot of

46
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,019
urban explorers would um a good examples
that is if you go across the street to

47
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:47,860
Penn Station

48
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,290
if you look around you keep a keen eye
from legal areas we're not trespassing

49
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,440
you can find remnants of the late great
Penn Station that used to be there

50
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,690
granted this small little pieces like

51
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,349
an old sign on the wall that'll say
Hudson River Railroad which is now

52
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,099
called past are

53
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,819
but you can actually see little things
like that and these are things that

54
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:12,959
millions of people walk by and don't
notice or care and us is urban explorers

55
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,470
we get kind of kiki with

56
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,920
history and with infrastructure around
us which is

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,050
where the starts to go into hacking and
I'll how is it related to hacking

58
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,099
well a lot of times urban explorers will

59
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,470
utilize things that are not meant for
them to get around and they will utilize

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,430
it to get around

61
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,049
first steam tunnels at universities is a
good example of that

62
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:37,150
other examples of our urban exploring

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,019
are is a bed mints likes large state
hospitals that happens to be my favorite

64
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:41,930
thing to explore

65
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,760
just cuz I get to see how things worked
in another era and

66
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,010
they're like entire abandoned cities are
some other with a hundred-plus buildings

67
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,989
with their own police and fire
departments

68
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,640
power plant's steam tunnels sewage water

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,650
everything in its like you get this
whole city to do a post-mortem on

70
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,920
I like an autopsy and you don't get to
do that your own city

71
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,470
entirely as much as you do an
independent state hospital

72
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,730
active buildings arm this doesn't always
have to even be tunnels or anything i

73
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,080
mean

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,110
there's a lot of people who like to go
into their area mange

75
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,880
Main Street get into an apartment
building stairwell or something and go

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,850
up on the rooftop that's called rooftop

77
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,310
arm it's their active buildings but not
everybody gets in on the rooftop you get

78
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,020
a different view of your city

79
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,210
and I'm not even talking about places
like Manhattan we're on 18 story

80
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,680
building such as this one

81
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,060
even like little Main Street on Long
Island where I am some people like to go

82
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,910
up there and have picnics and

83
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,380
look around and see the city from a
different light

84
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,040
are also drains like storm drains I
don't do that because

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,470
you know you need to be really small and
I don't know they flat out everything I

86
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,190
don't like

87
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,930
getting wet that much but a lot of you
know teenagers and stuff they explore

88
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,979
storm drains that can be fun that's a
whole nother infrastructure

89
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,139
hidden under your city that's not meant
for you to travel but you can get from

90
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,430
one place to the other

91
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,840
using I am transit tunnels are in the
city here that's a very popular a means

92
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,169
of

93
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,039
exploring arm on to tell you about
something

94
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,130
those who are in town that you can
explore this is a legal you're not

95
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,789
supposed to open its mild

96
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:16,590
and I think most if you can get away
with it take the number six train

97
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,820
go downtown when they say it's the last
stop

98
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,960
pretend you're sleeping don't get off
the conductor sees you will try to get

99
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,090
you off the train

100
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,190
if he just thinks that you fell asleep
he might not care he didn't when I did

101
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,080
it

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,169
stay on the train and when it starts to
move open your eyes and look out the

103
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:31,799
window

104
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,169
you're gonna pick you're gonna pass the
original City Hall station

105
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:38,340
that was one of the original New York
City subway stations and it's been

106
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,350
abandoned for some time now because it's
right

107
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,500
under City Hall directly and it has all
these

108
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,639
you know curves and stairwells that lead
up to nowhere anymore in it

109
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,740
chandeliers and it still lit up awfully
tough in

110
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,430
when you're on the hook you can see it
really well you could probably even take

111
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,500
a picture too although they probably
wouldn't like that too much but

112
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,830
Howard I'll

113
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,068
so that something you can you can all do
well your

114
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,750
you or can't do but you should

115
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,860
0 now for some places that interest you
know me and my wife here Laura who was

116
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,319
always by my side were over explore

117
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,750
I love I already told you some other
place I like the state hospitals this is

118
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,639
the next slide

119
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,759
um examples thereof up by me they had
because

120
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,500
we will like a filling station for the
new york's mentally insane we had

121
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,060
at one time ask for abandon large state
hospitals with

122
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,590
a population of over 40,000 to 50,000
people

123
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,850
1950s one of those facilities Kings Park
is now a 67 abandoned building facility

124
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,479
I and it's just fun to explore I have
some pictures to show you with that some

125
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,120
other things another 1i like this

126
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,740
those %uh view 40 little more so the
city here is poughkeepsie has

127
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,699
Hudson River State Hospital which has a
building that's like a quarter of a mile

128
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:54,430
long

129
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,110
and it looks like it's a castle from
your dreams I'll show you a picture that

130
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,090
later too

131
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,610
I did say that urban exploring is
illegal and i wanna go over that a

132
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,780
little bit more

133
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,979
and award thanks

134
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,580
um so yes New York state Penal Code
every state is different because the

135
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,520
exploring the I'm gonna be talking about
is not federal property federal laws

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,780
most likely don't apply I am NOT a
lawyer

137
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,080
this is not meant as legal advice this
is just stuff that I found on the web

138
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,490
that I thought you guys might find
helpful

139
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,370
and our like I said it is illegal and if
you're gonna

140
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,620
trespass on federal property which can
also be interesting there's a whole new

141
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,419
set of laws and I imagine there a lot
more stringent

142
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,198
are and I'm not gonna cover them I'm
gonna cover New York State lost because

143
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,599
its what I bother to look up because I
come from New York State

144
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,039
arm trespassing in New York State is all
under 140

145
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,318
of the Penal Code Soto was 140 points
something

146
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,479
and are 140 points 05 the one that
you're on top

147
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:56,758
is the one that you're probably almost
never get charged with that

148
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,120
that if you do you can just count your
blessings because

149
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,280
that's the most mild levels getting
charged with something

150
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,949
and that simple trespass it's a
violation which means it's like a

151
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:07,180
parking ticket

152
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,250
its probably not could affect your
record if it does probably not too bad

153
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,819
again I'm not a lawyer that's not legal
advice

154
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,340
are that when you could just if you
wanted to you could just check of guilty

155
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
or not guilty and send it in just

156
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,949
it's just like a parking ticket almost
always they're going to charge you with

157
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:25,470
what are the next few

158
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:30,650
are 140 top 10 are for criminal trespass
in the third degree

159
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:34,919
up actually we were caught want to know
going to that story a little bit part of

160
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,829
that's what we were charged with the
charges were dropped but that's what

161
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,610
they tried to

162
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,019
now us with and I'll out if for those
are you a ticket on my car to get caught

163
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:43,620
now

164
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,339
that was after like I'd say about 5,000
times is going into really carry

165
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:48,870
missions and close calls

166
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,580
and only one time of getting caught and
it was dropped

167
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,950
so its it tends to be our you know
physical

168
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,820
trespassers tend to be treated a lot
more leniently in our society than

169
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,940
computer trespass is still I I don't
think that's fair

170
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,040
are I think that people who are
exploring to learn things not to do harm

171
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,990
should be treated the same whether
they're physically trespassing or

172
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,610
virtually trespassing on a computer and
by treated the same I mean

173
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:21,930
you know slap on the wrist

174
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,370
of so criminal trespass in the third
degree

175
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:28,830
arm if you talked with that its Class B
misdemeanor it's the same as

176
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,160
being caught with a little bit a pot New
York out a little bit more than your

177
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,399
traffic ticket

178
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:37,950
are you can theoretically go to jail for
up to 90 days for that although in

179
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,350
reality nobody really does because it's
such a minor crime

180
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,029
are and their there is fines usually
about five hundred to two thousand

181
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:45,779
dollars that

182
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,560
if found guilty or plead guilty which is
the same you can end up paying

183
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,709
the next one is criminal trespass in the
second-degree which is if you trespass

184
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,540
inside of a dwelling that somebody lives
in

185
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,640
and we're under police can sometimes
play games with things I mean

186
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,870
if there's a park director that's on
site and they say that you know

187
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,010
he's moving into that building whether
or not I i mean

188
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,029
who knows what they could say I have no
idea but that would be it

189
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:13,980
a class a misdemeanor the state's get
raised a little bit you can do up to a

190
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,680
year in jail for that but in reality

191
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,140
probably a plea bargain so much less
criminal trespass in the first-degree

192
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,189
I have no sympathy for those who do this
and that is

193
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,910
those who explore with deadly weapons it
used to say on the largest firearms but

194
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,300
now its deadly weapons which can include

195
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,130
are a large knife gone are something
that should

196
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,149
you know potentially hurt somebody I've
ran into homeless people

197
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:40,950
in buildings not affect we threw her
29th birthday where we had cake in an

198
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,279
abandoned room that we swept up and
cleaned out

199
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,810
and the whole most people in the
building came to join us in actually

200
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,120
made it more fun and they were very into
it

201
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,350
I've I've never if they see that you're
not there to harm them even if their

202
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,839
crack heads the most the time they're
not gonna bother you i've never

203
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,149
ran into a circumstance where it was any
different than that but I love

204
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,839
if you try it trespass with a weapon
that makes it a class D felony

205
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,990
you can go to prison for over a year for
that and there's gonna be really steep

206
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:05,899
fines

207
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,410
and although I'll probably be plea
bargain to a misdemeanor

208
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,719
options have plea bargaining or not to
be as good burglary

209
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,100
gonna ask for you not to go in there is
still something you just go in there

210
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,019
take pictures and look around why would
burglary applied

211
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:23,459
of but it does because burglary does not
mean that you're stealing something

212
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,730
burglary in New York State anyway means
that you're trespassing

213
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,040
with the intent to commit another crime
while you're inside

214
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,160
no matter how minor that other crime can
be

215
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,630
so you know like this a lot of things
they can get you with that you read some

216
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,899
documents that maybe you didn't have
access to read

217
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,560
I love you know this is not urban
exploring but

218
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,230
you know if your ok graffiti or
something like that in the building some

219
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,279
people consider graffiti art part of

220
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,620
scoring that's a very controversial area
I personally don't consider that pork

221
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,329
exports

222
00:11:55,329 --> 00:11:59,130
but if you did that that would then
raised the trespassing to burglary

223
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,389
and that's gonna look a lot worse on
your record because 10

224
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,810
potential employer reach burglary
they're gonna think that you were in

225
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,829
someone's house running out with the TV
set

226
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:10,320
at least that's what most people think
when they see it burglary second-degree

227
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,730
the pretty much the same as the
trespassing from here

228
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,490
again I think it's like a dwelling
burglary in the first degree is with a

229
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,779
deadly weapon

230
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,700
and possession of burglar tools they can
go with a lot of latitude on this if

231
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,450
they think that anything you have

232
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,410
was used to gain entry or you intended
to use it to gain entry

233
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,990
they can get you with that and that's
totally separate crime that could be

234
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,089
charged on top

235
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:35,320
of the trespassing and up a burglary
toll could be is something as simple as

236
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,560
a screwdriver or

237
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,850
a mag light a fuse that I like pushing
the borders of

238
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,410
anything that you used in forcible entry
is burn a little common misnomer in

239
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,449
arm New York State is that there's
breaking and entering are there is no

240
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,560
such crime in New York State it's
covered under

241
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,120
all these they were just call it
criminal trespassing or burglary tall

242
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,790
some states to call a breaking and
entering

243
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:00,029
and arm you can find all these laws on
find law

244
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,050
as I did and this is just the from the
lawyers the legal definitions that I cut

245
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,170
and pasted from the web

246
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,250
with credit on the bottom to them are

247
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm just gonna go through these real
quick is nobody likes to read legalese

248
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,139
but I'm just showing that is there and I
did do my homework so

249
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:18,700
are so what really happens if you get
caught

250
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,680
99.99 percent of the time you gonna be
asked to leave

251
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,060
especially if you look an oculus

252
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,550
they're not gonna really harass you too
much

253
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,880
they're gonna escalated a little if they
do see a camera because

254
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,370
simply for the fact security guards
don't like the pictures being taken

255
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,290
because if they get out on the web but
you'll also do it makes them look bad

256
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,660
it's proof that they're not doing their
job are

257
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:46,439
you next step up if they escalate it
would be to ask for your ID so that they

258
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,230
can threaten that if you come back again
you will be arrested and no

259
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:53,269
that down they could say they know who
you are are usually that means the same

260
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:54,699
as just being asked to leave

261
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:58,459
usually doesn't go anywhere even if you
are caught again are the next step up

262
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,570
with the arrest where they actually have
the police come with police already

263
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,050
there

264
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,639
your physically taken to the precinct
interested

265
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,320
arm if they arrest you get yourself a
lawyer you gonna go for arraignment

266
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,389
are you probably going to be police and
very low bail on your own recognizance

267
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:15,649
if all you were doing was trespassing
and

268
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,250
another no other complications I know we
were we were inside a building were

269
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,329
a state park director kinda told us that
he knew what we were doing was cool with

270
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:22,910
it

271
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,480
but then when his underlings caught us
and he was given pressure from above not

272
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,130
allow people to trespass he turned on a
sand

273
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,079
he had he had charges pressed against us
and up

274
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,320
we will call we actually spoke to the
police over the phone we came down

275
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,029
turned herself in at a preset they were
very admirable about it they admitted

276
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:40,820
that they liked our site

277
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,779
and that they were actually fares on it
and one of them was given me tips on

278
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,029
things that he explored when he was a
kid

279
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,250
up and he told me how it's gonna work
that

280
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,290
I to should get a lawyer because they do
have to charge because they're being

281
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,610
forced to

282
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,139
and that'd be an arraignment there was
and that's where they just decide like

283
00:14:58,139 --> 00:14:59,230
you know you don't

284
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,010
going to arraignment tell them you're
not guilty or don't argue with the

285
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,430
judges that that's just

286
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,500
you know I plan on trying to all my
court dates please let me go on

287
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,399
Lobell that's what arraignment is of
pre-trial dealings that's where your

288
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,850
case is most likely gonna and for some
the simple

289
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,820
you're gonna be forced it to either a
COD which is a German on contemplation

290
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,880
of dismissal

291
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,880
which if you've never been in trouble
before that means that keep your nose

292
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,300
clean for six months this is not
probation you don't have to

293
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,459
jump to any group and the judge looks at
it after six months and drop surcharges

294
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,740
off-the-record they stay on the record
that you were arrested

295
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,509
but you can't there's ways of dealing
with that down the future too but again

296
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:35,180
I'm not a lawyer you need one for that

297
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,540
are if you go if you don't plea bargain
you go to court and

298
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:42,099
and and you if you found guilty of that
sentencing which

299
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,160
usually plea bargain is option for such
a minor crime

300
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,250
our newly Essex are

301
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,730
you shouldn't really are take anything
from the building I think

302
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,440
that one exception that I have are to
that is

303
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,329
if its documentation that's historical
note: and you plan on

304
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:03,940
I somehow distributing it or giving it
to other people so they can enjoy to

305
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,519
and it's something that looks like it
was going to be destroyed in the first

306
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:08,130
place for example

307
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,500
are if you walk into a building and you
see a bunch of

308
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,420
maps up the place from how it was fifty
years ago and they left them there was

309
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,509
water dripping on this black mold all of
them

310
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:22,899
I would say by all means take those home
dry them off scraped up black mold of

311
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,570
get them out there for other people to
see because they're not going to do

312
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,740
anybody any good rotted away on a table

313
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,750
a lot of urban explorers are against
that affected personally I think the

314
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,730
reason for it is

315
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,370
is because they don't want you to take
stuff that they can fart of

316
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,180
up this is this is my ethics and I just
wanna go through this really

317
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,279
quick because are I have some pictures
to show at all

318
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:48,310
are you a field guide are what to bring
I always bring

319
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:52,440
are small flashlight never large one
like one like this

320
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:56,290
and lot of people think they don't have
a text or anything bring up spot later a

321
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,139
mag light

322
00:16:57,139 --> 00:16:59,920
all you need is something good enough
for yourself to see if you want to take

323
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,730
pictures

324
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,750
get yourself a camera that has manual
shutter settings don't rely on a

325
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,419
flashlight

326
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:08,350
fiscal thank you official crappy and the
reason I wanted small

327
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:11,119
because suppose I have to leave the
building in a hurry because maybe this

328
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,069
somebody

329
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:15,309
in the building with a copper something
like that or somebody I do think is

330
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,839
dangerous like a vandal

331
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,289
and I want to leave the building really
quick I don't wanna be walking around

332
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,480
the neighborhood but this

333
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,620
ten foot long MaxLite my and kiss it was
attention to me and says look at me I'm

334
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,299
doing something I'm not supposed to

335
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:29,370
I put this under my waist and when I
walked up here not one person probably

336
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,039
noticed

337
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,299
at it and I always carry these on me so
that I can explore anything that I see

338
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:37,460
whether it be in this hotel or in the
city or anywhere are

339
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,350
bring some water bring some toilet paper
these things you're gonna need if you're

340
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,559
exploring a long time of people giggle
when I say toilet paper but

341
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:47,639
you want to get going if you caught the
building without any have to go

342
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,770
docklands weapons don't bring our people
with poor judgment skills that are

343
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,100
common mistake have a lot of urban
explorers

344
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,490
you bring somebody in in all the sudden
they pull out like from a place you can

345
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,020
even see a pic action start chopping
things up in you look no

346
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,240
few don't bring unnecessary heavy items
I mean

347
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,309
church do you really need that bowling
ball to roll down the hallway probably

348
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:09,710
not the

349
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,390
%uh don't bring anything that looks too
suspicious I have one friend that

350
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:13,260
explores

351
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,650
and he was full-time ok here I mean he
thinks is being discreet

352
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,340
wearing a camouflage bandanna little
camouflage paint on his face

353
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,059
camouflage shirt camouflage pants
camouflage vest fleshlight

354
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,620
well he's walking around in asylum vol
paved roads and brick buildings

355
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,010
he stands out like a sore thumb dressed
in normal clothes that would make you

356
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,140
fit into the area you are you get away
with a lot easier

357
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,190
up as far as things like how you can
find places to explore once you find

358
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:39,630
them

359
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,080
tapos on this is about some tacos on its
a great resource

360
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,320
up top ozone dot com and this is Kings
Park which isn't too far from me and you

361
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,080
can see that just by pulling stuff I now
have a grounds map

362
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,820
I can see all the buildings that are
part of the center are and where

363
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,250
you know all the hills and access ways
or which might help you for finding

364
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,640
entrance were entryways

365
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,610
does one find entryways in the back so
buildings were talk offered by weeds and

366
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,590
nobody goes because neither do the
people support them up usually

367
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:09,080
%uh Google Earth I I don't like Google
Earth visit it sucks

368
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,840
and up if you look at this map this is
proof that it sucks I don't just say

369
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,330
things without merit it's good for some
areas but this is

370
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,530
Hudson River State Hospital how many
people here to pick a plan

371
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,840
on what they want to see and how they're
going to explore based on this i know i

372
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,820
couldnt

373
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,809
there's always ways around New York
State interactive mapping is most states

374
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:28,320
have a GIS system

375
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,159
this one is from the state and this is
the same app now I can make plans to see

376
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,770
down here at the bottom

377
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,150
there's a parking lot way it waits
bottom center

378
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,140
and it looks kinda films see little
orange and indeed that's a Home Depot

379
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,860
parked there what back here what's this
train tracks

380
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:47,549
that's that's going to be that would be
my first way to think of getting in

381
00:19:47,549 --> 00:19:48,990
because nobody's gonna be patrolling

382
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,850
most likely on the train tracks and
fears that large building I told you

383
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:53,370
about that

384
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,750
Kirkbride arm its like a quarter mile
long and comes away from here goes like

385
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,669
this:

386
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,900
this this all around here it's connected
to this and that's you know

387
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,850
really calling it's all connected by
tunnels like this building over here

388
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,080
which is like a

389
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,010
11-story you know cute one with wings
and the

390
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:13,770
so that that is a good way to figure out
how your gonna gain access access just

391
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,030
by looking at different GIS in a real

392
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,220
our systems and you can see where you're
gonna parked in a lot of things that

393
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,940
love urban explorers including myself
can't stand

394
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:25,809
is when we get ames from somebody saying
where do I park how do I get it how do I

395
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:27,789
avoid security what is it like

396
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,539
like I mean come on like just you don't
even bother to look at a map first you

397
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,220
want me to do all the work for you

398
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:36,570
at least look at a map first to say I
noticed there's a parking lot on the

399
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:36,990
bottom

400
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:40,429
is that a good place to park where they
patrol if somebody says that I have a

401
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:41,140
lot more

402
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,419
respect for them that if they just say
where do you park how do you get it

403
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:48,350
like it entrances change all the time
you know you gotta find your own

404
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,150
I this is a topo map of hudson river
also from new york city interactive

405
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,070
mapping

406
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,750
as you zoom in it goes to topo map to
are aerial

407
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,799
and I'll these are things are you
talking about lending in

408
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,110
I always take safety precautions always
be looking at the ground I know too many

409
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,159
people who will be the cell phone and
manholes or stepped on something that it

410
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:08,429
went through their foot

411
00:21:08,429 --> 00:21:11,820
have a few friends at that has happened
to just looking at the ground can

412
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,270
usually avoid that

413
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,379
and I just wanna show you a few pictures
before we move on to Laura's here for

414
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:23,380
the talk

415
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,700
well actually for someone show video
clips changed order

416
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,500
missile arm live system this is the

417
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,230
2600 the magazine actually started at
Stony Brook University

418
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,570
and this is the suffering of screen
their own University

419
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,689
that's a little bit late

420
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,400
yeah

421
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,330
this to me yeah

422
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,270
my

423
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:57,480
we're gonna go on

424
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,420
that's what's directly

425
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,100
for them home network

426
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,480
hear the noises on the snack Steve
Holmes multiplex hobson's expanding that

427
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,700
song writers about a hundred the breeze

428
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,000
I every now and then like just now just
the pencil

429
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,279
that stuff out show

430
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,400
its schools all over

431
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,140
that about getting lost figuring out
where your

432
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,930
with ago and also people use it actually
around like

433
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,730
slow like from one building overall it's
raining

434
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,940
illegal at all you know try way to do it
is

435
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,000
there were the cold when everybody else
is walking

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,980
classes

437
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:45,980
you know 20 whether I'm walking classes

438
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,810
and I'll I'm gonna tell you mission lot
of someplace I recently went well I show

439
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,730
you the video of it on a turn the volume
down

440
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:03,490
are this official for a brief overview

441
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,410
it off the coast for my own which is
just the stuff on our art actually

442
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,090
considered part of suffolk county state
a little military I and that's now used

443
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,760
for

444
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,020
research for great call I could never
find a way there tried coaxing from the

445
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,480
morning take me

446
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,370
but he was afraid if the nearby race
which she said smallest 20 football

447
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,010
up and it was a fun placement used in
the eighteen hundreds all the way up to

448
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:26,860
World War two

449
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,050
and I'll basically finally at a friend's
funeral

450
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,659
once I ran into a buncha people from
coastal defence studies you always keep

451
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,290
your ears open Internet Explorer

452
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,810
and I mention trickle Island truman who
said that these this group is planning a

453
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,850
trip there tomorrow so I searched for
their trip help promote their equipment

454
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,020
on everything I got to spend the weekend

455
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,379
have to stand behind this one in the
batteries with the use to load the

456
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,530
shells into a lot of things

457
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,680
try to do with her but trying to figure
out how thing were things work

458
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,960
you can see the train tracks coming and
obviously wasn't train station

459
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,680
it was used for loading the store
shelves this was a 16-inch battery

460
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,950
are as I found two people work at 12 the
people brought from our

461
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,560
research and I we learned all about how
the stun workers actually require oil

462
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,480
sands sinks into that hit so that it's
kinda hidden

463
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,470
and we explore the hell outta this place
and found all sorts of little hidden

464
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,780
instances like this one

465
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,070
that led up to a stairway it was like
I'll little

466
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:25,409
ideally fit through it I squeeze into a
lot of things a lot of you

467
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:28,930
believe but are led to a staircase that
leads to

468
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,690
a lookout tower that you could see the
whole island was just kinda really cool

469
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,900
to see how they had that kinda and all
these rules with a loaded the munitions

470
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,340
we also found AR a room where r

471
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,429
the reason it is a break because it at
all bars on the window there was a four

472
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,740
door that was taken off

473
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,030
and I'll use it is do not land because
they don't want anybody going there for

474
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,740
the perpetrators

475
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,000
but anyway we figured out was afraid
because there was talk telling auction 1

476
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,280
a.m. Sep 28 days left had seen as this
island is an explorer by anybody but the

477
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,110
museum people

478
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,800
say I believe when they said that they
did to safety political research for

479
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,280
thirty years so that's pretty 2001

480
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:13,280
and I'm gonna on a stuff out of this and
%uh this is Kings Park the asylum I want

481
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,890
to show you that in my neighborhood

482
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,400
and this is like it was a part of a
trailer for a documentary that we made

483
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,030
on the place but it just shows how

484
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:25,120
urban exploring to increase your
creativity I learned skills on how to

485
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,900
make music videos

486
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:33,900
had a file thing for me to shut up

487
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:20,250
it you can see like any city the place
had artwork

488
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,970
it had I large buildings and even had a
more good or not and if you quote that

489
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:25,760
the video but

490
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,990
the kinda penned into one of the more
slaps and the

491
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:32,430
it's just fun to explore these places
cuz you can find out how your society

492
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:38,620
works and I just wanna show off your
pitches really quick

493
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:45,620
gonna go through these really like fast

494
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:51,159
this is up in abandoned airplane factory
with a maid World War two

495
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,960
fighter planes this is a library inside
of a psych Center and Poughkeepsie the

496
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,680
1i showed you a map of before

497
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,600
again this is one at the bit to
buildings that the quarter mile long

498
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,940
building called the Kirkbride

499
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:05,180
are this is a record room with records
from the eighteen hundreds to nineteen

500
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,970
sixties in the basement of Central Islip
segment building this is cards that

501
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,490
patients used to use his money

502
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,830
are because so they wouldn't lose it
again that's that same record room so

503
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,159
there's a lot of stuff left behind lot
of people try to sail won't even bother

504
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,700
going in there is not much for this is
Norwich State Hospital

505
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,490
where the bed to pretty much set up as
they probably would have been this a

506
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:25,100
tunnel in the same hospital

507
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,460
are I love stone work on buildings they
don't do it really that much anymore in

508
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,780
on these older buildings sometimes only
please find

509
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,970
his tuberculosis pens where they used to
key people outside so they would get

510
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,720
fresh air

511
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,540
this was an abandoned truck under a
supermarket where it used to be a road

512
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,870
because it was an open air market there
you can see the road

513
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,090
%ah this is a Nike missile base our new
killer missile base that was next to a

514
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,890
high school

515
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,470
its now-abandoned I got permission from
the army to explore it this is a %uh

516
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,310
steam tunnel that you would find at the
most

517
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:57,470
state hospitals this is a state hospital
row of seclusion rooms you can see the

518
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:57,840
little

519
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,230
stereotypical windows this is a power
plant that had all these tunnels going

520
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,350
through it I love exploring power plants
unfortunately

521
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,680
they destroyed it %uh this is another
power plant in the same area because the

522
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,280
center was so big it had a few with them

523
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,280
and it's now a town building that
they're using but they let me in the

524
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,770
basement was already mentioned above one
it was a powerful including the tunnels

525
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,570
and the chimney

526
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,220
which they are now using as a storage
facility this is looking up the chimney

527
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,280
this is Stony Brook University Stony
Brook University

528
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,420
a we want full circle on switches good I
love

529
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:34,180
let's see I just want to show some power
plants to say like exploring knows cuz

530
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,620
it's fun to see all the machinery and
how it works

531
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,840
and figure out how you society works and
others

532
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,570
same way they did things at a state
hospital was pretty much the same way

533
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,450
your neighborhood what with the
exception of the also distribute its

534
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,620
theme this week hope all burners with
the coals poured in from the top

535
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,950
brought up by conveyor belts right here
you can see

536
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,520
let me stop the side speed you can see
these tanks

537
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,030
it's like Tom the stack right here you
can see our

538
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,210
it's like where the capital the call it
was brought in by train

539
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:08,000
are to a trestle and was brought up to
hear important and it was dropped into

540
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,540
the SCO burners and so they could work
on it they had these catwalks

541
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:16,320
and you have to be careful because if
you look carefully at this if you look

542
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,850
carefully at this catwalk

543
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:21,030
you can see that there's a section
missing and I was filming video not

544
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,170
looking at the floor this time

545
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:25,360
and if I woulda went through that woulda
been a five-story drop underneath

546
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,170
these places are not meant for humans to
walk anymore they're not maintained

547
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,790
are electrical control panels each one
control the different building it's

548
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,129
almost like a breaker box

549
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,340
now the fewer the same these are the
turbines with the steam is pumped

550
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,310
through actually generate the
electricity

551
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,290
looking up the chimney I the trestle
where the call was delivered from

552
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,570
this is another power play it you can
see the conveyor belt that took the call

553
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,169
up to the top and distributed it

554
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,330
are there is the call time right here at
the top the

555
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,770
with the call was kept it was dropped
into the six-point hours if I were

556
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,000
standing here I would come up to about
here

557
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,720
as tall as I am so this whole thing was
like a cathedral to size it was a ments

558
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,210
inside you can get more viewers that
from here you could tell by how tall is

559
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,120
Windows or

560
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:10,200
I and we came full circle on that and
that's what part of the talk I'm gonna

561
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,840
turn it over to Laura now who's gonna

562
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,840
give you her I on urban exploring sheets

563
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:29,710
so funny thing about that

564
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,440
I'll I get set up up all me and I can
missile base

565
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,680
mission we actually speak to tiny

566
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,680
major minor

567
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,419
that's

568
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,640
yet yes and I was actions that was a
joke the first time sounds like

569
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,680
major minor but then we call major
miners

570
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:02,920
so it's real a lot of times it's easier
to try to

571
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,770
get permission first if you can why this
doesn't want to

572
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,850
was mine

573
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:17,850
stock itself

574
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:28,408
stride

575
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:33,090
homes

576
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,670
yeah a lot of people are explore for the
thrill of being

577
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,350
chased by the police and all that but I
true urban explorer

578
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,500
would %ah not like yeah and that's me
that some another excuse

579
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,900
why did take something building rescue
ok at an abandoned building

580
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,530
that used to be part of a psych center
and that was signed have it by homeless

581
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,730
polls funny things like all bombs

582
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,900
anne's now while looking quite happy
life

583
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,090
my mom mother my mother-in-law's house
is four times as weight now

584
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,510
yes and probably four times as
rambunctious

585
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,320
also thinks the C-seventeen mention on
this is your say

586
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,750
a brief summary of things that you can
see or going exploring and I'm sure

587
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,929
you'll find a lot more

588
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:21,080
on for us we tend to focus a lot on the
asylum sonya just because or something

589
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,980
one thing about them

590
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,850
I really gets to you and she doesn't
mean one thing like this and ghosts to

591
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,200
ask people claim that

592
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,710
that's another story on schedule yes
it's a

593
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,309
I actually dreams walking the hallways
after going exploring it or something

594
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,678
can get see after a while has a special
feeling but

595
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,210
on the SIR some comes home the first
urban exploring

596
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,549
you know it's a matter of curiosity were
free we were told that the one place one

597
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:49,840
exploding arsonists in crazy people
living in the buildings

598
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,880
but I just have to see what was in there
and

599
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,990
you know through years if the learning
what you doing it for sure very free

600
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:00,500
curiosity will you know just overcome
that eventually

601
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,970
other things you you gain its power
observations

602
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:07,600
watch what you do when you look at how
people moving to CPAC

603
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,809
look at routes security things like that
you also have a listen fray noises

604
00:33:12,809 --> 00:33:16,320
heighten your senses that way on
entrances

605
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,500
and now this refers to buildings a
person going into subway tunnels or

606
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,760
something you'll find your own tips and
tricks but

607
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,440
a lot of times security will try to lock
up a building but if there's a place

608
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,110
it's really catchy your

609
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,630
a place with two climb over weeds and
tumbling brochure or do any sort of hard

610
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,540
work to get

611
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:38,879
they usually don't lock so much is
usually one with checkout you wanna

612
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,510
usually it's a good idea to try to do
more work than you think the security

613
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:47,419
if if if I you know stealth also
quietness

614
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,530
%uh there's been a couple times where
you know we've had close encounters

615
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,740
and I just being dead still not make any
noise not

616
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,490
think knows got this out a bit I'm not
so quick story

617
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:02,419
there was one time mom in a certain
tunnel which are not going to say where

618
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,929
on an alliance life area

619
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,879
we were there and not somebody tried to
come downstairs into the tunnel that

620
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:10,960
where there is a door

621
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,679
now it was locks you the steps coming
down with a girl they're not going to

622
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,629
give any way it's locked them here the
jingle keys

623
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:21,618
and we're standing right by the door not
allowed to be there so

624
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,450
one of moscow's on senator one of us
goes on the other the dude opens a door

625
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:27,359
walks and it's pitch black

626
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,100
CS he looks and i cant feel the breath

627
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,879
which sits there dead quiet walks looks
both ways

628
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:40,790
and goes back out the door unfortunately
he turns around the second time

629
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,830
and flicks on the white man sees both of
us now tell them about how we got

630
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,560
uncaught

631
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,600
okay running running from police is a
bad idea

632
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:57,600
from security guards go ahead high
school sports

633
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,390
you know what a break in a Connecticut
Court anyway but I

634
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,540
so he sees says that his basement white
is wonderful so once I want us on the

635
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,630
other side we just appeared outta
nowhere

636
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:14,609
any marks logos you guys wanna come up
cell

637
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:18,069
so I currently work at Gawker rather
this is like sure

638
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:21,970
you know let's go service to and john
decides to ask a question

639
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,040
let's have a lot of sleep going up the
stairs and I make sure prop the door

640
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,020
from the time we were in

641
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,109
open yet so is my job to make sure know
the doors locked behind

642
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:34,490
some like ramming a chair in there like
try not to let him know this

643
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,770
so John ask this guy question and you're
trying to feel freddie was in the guy

644
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,980
just those on israeli was I got to
trespassers

645
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,470
a job so I look up the stairs and i
looked at him and said you know what

646
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:50,540
not and Iran back down the stairs
grabbed your tractor combustion she's

647
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,830
running as fast as she kept

648
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,319
that same share that was propping open
the door we know which to talk to the

649
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,390
doorknob at the door close locking the
door

650
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,440
he's trying every one of his keys
wondering I keep getting

651
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,880
we're into the tunnel came out a manhole
got no car and drove around the building

652
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,350
is

653
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:09,000
security was all around tryna finally
actually got to watch

654
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,460
try to look for some terrified actually
count that as a mishap though because

655
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:17,850
if you know if I love we weren't hurt
that would never even happened I think I

656
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,589
was coming down there because it was
event that I climbed up a ladder to look

657
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:21,020
out

658
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,310
and I think that I was hurt when I did
that I think he was coming down

659
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,509
check that out so it happens human to
human error

660
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:31,000
don't think that you're perfect when you
explore your gonna make mistakes and if

661
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,520
you wanna get out alive don't try to
cover your mistakes

662
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,310
work with yeah one other thing is in
torrents on the specially

663
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,740
we do a lot of times we go into the
silence as well the whole day trip

664
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:45,290
somethings asylums have you know
twenty-two hundred or more buildings and

665
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:45,850
I see

666
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,390
cover the mall one day we try to
especially there's a tunnel system that

667
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,618
goes from one to the other

668
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:54,580
will try to not get as much as possible
you talk to me 8-9 hours

669
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,109
walking climbing stuff mock

670
00:36:58,109 --> 00:37:01,529
carrying a heavy backpack after you
really have to you can't build in

671
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:04,830
Torrance and creativity to like a city
on the sums

672
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,000
particularly on I never really new
myself that I was any certificate

673
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,730
harder for anything like that this
exploring it was really brought it up

674
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,020
on that mission logs had a couple to
share with you and I still have time

675
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:20,700
%uh Spanish in launching gotta be
careful what you reveal

676
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:24,530
because if they can and this is at least
in the xy if they can match

677
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,640
the time and the day and the location
improve both

678
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,660
it was last night sassy there I was
actually reading

679
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,160
the instructions the judges give two
juries to convict on the stuff

680
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,520
got a truck trial it is a jury trial yes
a felony or something like that and

681
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,060
one of the things that the the kinda
need is an honor about D

682
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,290
which means they can't just say all
summer disc I we think he trespassed

683
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,320
sometime within the past five years

684
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,380
that's not gonna float they should be
able to say we think that was on or

685
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,680
about the state

686
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,350
%uh they also need to actually prove you
were there having pictures above then

687
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,040
place does not prove you were there I
could've given anybody in this audience

688
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
a camera

689
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,020
told to take some pictures for me they
could have taking pictures in a place I

690
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,150
didn't even know it was

691
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,850
given me the pictures and that doesn't
mean I did something illegal for some

692
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,740
posting

693
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,790
lot of explorers are free to post
pictures because I like that

694
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,520
mission I did some legal and I mean if
that was the case then the new should be

695
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,560
arrested for having

696
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,140
videos people robbing 7-eleven's I mean
come on

697
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,118
yes you wanna be careful you don't want
to say you know I was in Kings Park

698
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,080
building 7 yesterday

699
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,279
you know July whatever July 21st or 22nd

700
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,890
on because you just handing them
information now all the time

701
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:35,950
gonna wanna go after but you know I mean
honestly for us

702
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:39,530
a site like ours you know it's it's kind
of such as

703
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:43,369
you know becomes trophy so the thing but
some you know what not to reveal some

704
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:45,450
people just hide locational to

705
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,210
altogether trying to get more to go to
pictures cuz she's a wonderful

706
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,470
photographer for better than I could
ever the

707
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:55,290
thank you well anyway this is a couple
links you can look at a few

708
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,950
if you can't write again you can always
email me lol the sauce engine links

709
00:38:58,950 --> 00:38:59,380
again

710
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,550
to by to make your own camera
stabilizers

711
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,680
taking video because you walk in your
planning of a wreckage you gonna get

712
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,259
this like shaky footstep

713
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,920
footage and this helps this is cheap
place to build things that count

714
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,730
harnesses stabilize it on you also like
I said

715
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,089
urban exploring for a lot of fun talents
and interests and I never thought I had

716
00:39:19,089 --> 00:39:23,609
I probably will to anyone who gets into
the hobby up before I get to my effort

717
00:39:23,609 --> 00:39:26,710
after fears surely the slide real quick
this is some

718
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:31,320
some other things that people do I this
free running which I'm sure some you've

719
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,200
seen videos up they have a style

720
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,320
parkour not that familiar with it but
i've seen

721
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,050
videos and I can tell you that I
probably will never do that in my life

722
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,490
have a lot of respect for the people
that do

723
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,400
people climb up the 10-story building
without a ladder on the outside

724
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,109
I mean some of these videos only to find
them on our Google video and you too

725
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:53,339
sometimes people look like spider for
christ sake yeah I have

726
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,160
when they do that I wish I don't think I
have great admiration for those talents

727
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,379
but you'll find ways to explore agile I
mean I personally I don't even like to I

728
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,000
can't even

729
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,420
climate change fetes my feet too big it
just doesn't work

730
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:10,290
over other ways now is always and
filtering is also similar the

731
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,529
days people decline the outside the
building scale

732
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,710
answer this and linking go to check
something that out

733
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,430
and let me get outta this this website
again

734

better than it does on their

758
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,130
yes this is this is a good shot it's on
you can find a lot of pictures on our

759
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,270
website this is an asylum at

760
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:12,700
up by Barry this is where people used to
sit and watch the autopsies

761
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,690
a lot of course it's been graffiti i
hack Northeast Philadelphia

762
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:23,380
yeah it's unfortunate Philadelphia in
the house

763
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,500
and this is all so by Perry it's a
beautiful smile but it really has been

764
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,109
you know

765
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:31,140
damage in some parts with graffiti this
is it's been torn down right now

766
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,580
yes coming lifted now like several other
buildings

767
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,720
I refuse to go back there because we
just

768
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,150
my you can attach these places and you
don't wanna go back and see have torn

769
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,040
down

770
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,509
yeah this is just you know I do
experiments with photography like

771
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,460
shadow on stuff again this is an asylum
this is it's a particular word

772
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,180
on this used to be where they they
believe that the patients had to get a

773
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,750
lot of fresh air so everything is open

774
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:58,810
and this is I thought this was really
ironic there's a window

775
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,990
and a book that's just take care of
yourself and the band missile

776
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,310
yourself without trick that took me

777
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:08,640
%uh this is just a couple hallway shots
for some asylums

778
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,910
this is eastern sea I eastern state Penn
legal place to explore also in

779
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:14,549
philadelphia you pay your fee

780
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:18,550
and %uh they let you go a little bit in
the prison you go where you are you just

781
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,580
sign a waiver that

782
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,060
unocal responsible for the trip and fall
or something it's it's

783
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:27,250
really very cool place now polls close
the state's I don't have any

784
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,450
have been anywhere else but all
allen-mia early twenties

785
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:34,210
these grand the states from very wealthy
families well they are pretty much

786
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,850
started dying out around the time the
Great Depression you're probably right

787
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,190
at Sierra yeah exactly but this is from
some in the states on the island that I

788
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:45,490
love the stonework this is just
something that i very much into

789
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:49,260
this used to be found it was in a state
that was at one time

790
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,310
owned by the exiled King albania

791
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,350
but he never actually showed up but yet
they said that his treasure was

792
00:43:56,350 --> 00:44:00,370
trapped in the walls so kids toward tore
the whole place down with their hands

793
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:00,740
with

794
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,790
hammers with travels whatever they could
it was burnt down and eventually

795
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,109
demolished

796
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,650
are the ironic part is that a treasure
wasn't in the walls it was the walls

797
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,060
yet whether very beautiful this
unfortunately is cut off to get a

798
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,359
monitor resolution but this was some

799
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:19,830
greystone which is another asylum
they've got a lot all

800
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:23,240
%uh wheelchairs there which makes for
great the top

813

its I think it was that the Smith nobody
hit the basement fun so

814
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,569

815
00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:23,740
have explored the hotel

816
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,690
every time I wanted to like I just met
somebody or heard somebody talking

10 minute warning okay we have all types
questions

832
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,160

cat was be a good example

833
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,470
photograph you would want to have in
your possession %uh

834
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:20,210
that sorta could I just showed up to the
public %uh that building isn't there

835
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,089
anymore

836
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:24,569
on order for them to proof that you were
there they actually have to like kinda

837
00:46:24,569 --> 00:46:25,060
show

838
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,080

going back in time to take a picture

839
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,870
that room

840
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,900
right dad's gone that's who's gonna if
they're gonna do that much work for a

841
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,170
misdemeanor

842
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:40,620
and %ah I mean look at this little girl
she rescued a kak come of it

843
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:45,690
fun this is a by the way to see now this
is not art

844
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:49,690
yeah just had should use discretion when
shown pictures that you're in

845
00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:53,069
but nobody's gonna know where that is
built the only other thing was the

846
00:46:53,069 --> 00:46:56,509
running from security guards I had
experience so or I was

847
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:00,010
held at gunpoint for about forty-five
minutes it was a shotgun

848
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,050
was not by security guard by security
officials had him arrested the guy legal

849
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:05,700
he was pointing the gun at me

850
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:09,710
for almost you'll feel like an hour it
was maybe 45 minutes whatever while they

851
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,640
call people

852
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,868
he was huge guy named time trespassing
well

853
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:17,000
yet we had heart we were not in the
building we were just parking lot

854
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,350
walking around the building

855
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,640
anyway um so I was gonna say and he just
walked a few

856
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,690
on a shotgun same to you help us while
you know it called other people parents

857
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:28,450
I was I was probably would've or come
see enough because I would've been so

858
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:29,450
personally escrow

859
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,770
I said I'm walking away what are you
gonna do shoot me I was 14 years old

860
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:37,560
that's what I was at school I anyways
they was tiny use a huge games clearly

861
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,000
so

862
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,100
I don't mean this is that thing away
those winter somebody as an insult but

863
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:41,869
but he was

864
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:45,550
really is a bowl well below average
intelligence oversight

865
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,600
there wasn't any hella security guards
are yeah

866
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,150
just like I never psychopath likes the
US simple device such a step

867
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:56,080
but have them I know once in a very cool
in the very intelligent and

868
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,589
I've actually had ones security give me
a torn show me things I would have never

869
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:00,310
seen before

870
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,490
I will add one detail and you'll
understand why didn't run this was in

871
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:09,089
South Carolina

872
00:48:09,089 --> 00:48:11,509
that's what I had

873
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,290
doing you for about 15 years and

874
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:17,910
awesome one thing that's happened
noticed at this

875
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,560
here basically in the past five six
years

876
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,549
Scott a lot more risky to in certain
areas particularly

877
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:29,470
utilities guitars are where whereof it
now they are aware that this hobby

878
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,410
trespassing and actually security is
getting now

879
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,890
busting you for answered abilities

880
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,080
and that's actually happened on
University Texas campus

881
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,520
for instance yes police photos steam
tunnels recently after

882
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,880
exploration yet but they also broke into
a door with tools and damaged

883
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,100
damage to doorway to get in is that a no
no lol

884
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,060
federal investigators ball so I've never
heard of anybody arrested for exploring

885
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,360
something after the Explorer when they
didn't do any damage just took pictures

886
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:02,350
unless they were caught on the spot but
if you go in there in your boss down

887
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:03,330
someone's door

888
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:07,069
to discuss teen thing you did just
edifice even it especially for to

889
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:10,080
active place or place a historic
significance and

890
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,560
I'm glad that you're arrested if you do
something like that you would but

891
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,430
whoever did that

892
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,089
yet this is a little bit some think
about that where you're going nowadays

893
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:22,410
their is a bit more russians these days
well you should always think about where

894
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,190
you going with

895
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:27,480
when you explore you should always odd
its it's not just jump right into it

896
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:27,940
it's like

897
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,320
you should reflect on what happens if
you get caught how you can avoid getting

898
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:31,710
caught

899
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,340
and then you don't just run up to the
door and try to get into the building

900
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,380
it's kinda like a little cold Paul

901
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,730
you put your comment you wiggle it
around like if it's a song title

902
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,230
maybe I'll just hang out around the
basement areas were allowed to be and

903
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,380
see how many times

904
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:48,000
the security or cop come by %ah than the
next

905
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,440
day maybe I'll come bye week later and
I'll try some other source sometimes to

906
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,480
get into some places can be like to a
year to thing where you

907
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,920
slowly step by step to it but then when
you finally do get in

908
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,359
you know that you have all the bases
covered that you could think of it's

909
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,460
just something to think about be careful

910
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,430
certain city utilities receive places
are gonna be monitored

911
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,759
just please definitely got to build more
careful

912
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,210
yes scoping it out the most whatever got
into

913
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:18,540
with please actually while I was placed

914
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:22,000
make I'm actually ban University Texas
just for scoping

915
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,470
how to play his find interesting but see
if it was oh if you scoping out from

916
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,670
that area that was legal like how would
they know you were scoping it out

917
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:33,340
I is assumed they saw us with lights and
everything that doesn't sound like you

918
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,300
were given due process i mean you
walking around places you're allowed to

919
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:36,690
be

920
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,170
and they're going to say oh you're
scoping out to trespass I mean that it

921
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,000
really doesn't you know but fight this

922
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,300
it would bother me I or you take the
next question is why the people

923
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:51,010
thank you on Long Island there's

924
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,690
Montauk Point Camp hero yes

925
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,180
given information about that is it %uh
yes hero is now a state park

926
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:02,190
you're allowed to walk around outside
the buildings have most if it there is a

927
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,300
fenced off area with a radar tower

928
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:09,270
%ah you know people have done in the
radar tower the still

929
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:12,500
military equipment in there it's very
historic there's also a conspiracy

930
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,960
theorist running around saying this
tunnels under the place

931
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,190
that used to do all sorts of experiments
and there was an underground I'll will

932
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:19,710
bury

933
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:23,180
bonkers able to not really because the
batteries from the gun placements

934
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,000
because German submarines were threat to
land there during world war 1&2

935
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,670
next question I i'm for school I love
you say thank you very much

936
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,900
thank you its um second I was wondering
if there's any particular advice you

937
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,530
headin

938
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:40,960
how common it was too like while you're
exploring run into people who

939
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,109
you may consider dangerous it happens
sometimes

940
00:51:44,109 --> 00:51:48,529
%ah but usually vandals a very Dom and
you're gonna hear them before they hear

941
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:49,040
you

942
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,509
there's no way it handles gonna hear an
urban explorer no matter how large or

943
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,820
like I am before CS before

944
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:59,810
you see them and I said actually with
her duck into a corner and have them

945
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,460
walk right by a good story that is a
program State Hospital

946
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,600
we're inside one of the buildings also
which one and we noticed the car park

947
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,609
right out by the door which no urban
explorer would do because that's just

948
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:11,100
stupid and flaking

949
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:14,840
yourself down and %uh I thought maybe
they were in the building with us I was

950
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,869
looking out the windows when all of a
sudden I saw a group of 16 17 year olds

951
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,910
%uh and one of them pulled out a gun and
started dancing around with that name

952
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,779
was like pointing at the windows are
used to shoot I jumped on top of her

953
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,230
like the secret service protecting the
president and then we crawled

954
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:33,680
into the tunnels and we went out another
building they weren't even aware that we

955
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,359
were in there

956
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:37,440
and because as an urban exploring other
observe

957
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,890
you're going to see them before they see
you people also don't want to see things

958
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:42,240
that are above their

959
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,830
their eyesight were on the floor as you
know is you always have the vandals who

960
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:46,259
dis

961
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,900
at their disadvantage for that reason
thank you the whole muscle find you

962
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,180
though

963
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:56,180
the move around like like a church mouse
no will find you

964
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,460
so there's a hezbollah people here like
causes

965
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,109
in a really interesting his phone try it
um

966
00:53:03,109 --> 00:53:06,180
what I'm wondering is is there any
advice you want to give

967
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:09,280
up to the new guys the new guys in
particular that is you know

968
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,490
don't do this when you got your first
question for example

969
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:15,820
a like never go hiking alone and other
stuff like that

970
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:19,510
don't don't bring weapons because it's
really don't if you are caught

971
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:22,880
increase what is gonna happen also

972
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,220
I've brought one friend that I found out
later that

973
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,950
without telling me he brought a weapon
which actually kind of them the fis me

974
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:33,080
because I didn't know about it the law
says you have to have knowledge of it

975
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:33,440
and

976
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,560
as soon as I found out I immediately
demanded that he leave

977
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,460
and what he did was very dangerous he
brought a shotgun shell inside a flare

978
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:40,800
gun

979
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,130
which would kill to solve the wood-fired
don't bring weapons that's the biggest

980
00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:46,420
thing I could say and %uh

981
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,109
don't bring stupid people also you know
who you explore with

982
00:53:50,109 --> 00:53:53,400
also for manoeuvre safety especially you
first time

983
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,630
tell someone trustworthy where you're
going on when you expect to be back

984
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:00,230
she get lost or injured or something
generous going alone than with the

985
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,120
person who has poor discretion

986
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:07,569
next share

987
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:10,890
Don last question okay sorry go ahead

988
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,750

that's very beautiful when it happens
it's a very good thing

995
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,740
I've been given tours have places that
would probably make you look like Osama

996
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,190
bin Laden if you were in

997
