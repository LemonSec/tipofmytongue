1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,310
good afternoon everyone

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:09,380
this is Richard computing

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,100
1300 area a on a Saturday

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,219
not going to talk very much just
remember the

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,210
lockpicking is available on the second
floor starting 2 o'clock

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,249
going until five o'clock barry in all
those folks will be down there

7
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:28,668
check it out also DVD's are available
every talk couple minutes after

8
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:32,509
talk ends 10 bucks a pop richer
computing

9
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:39,509
number 121 Sam its per of

10
00:00:40,449 --> 00:00:43,620
I have no hope these are

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,190
richer competing panel you enjoy doing
and

12
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,349
I'm Sam it's for background retro

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,829
Apple wants to lower that way back

14
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,710
since the seventies few other
experimental projects

15
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,760
we have your richer Cheshire also design
the Cheshire catalyst

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,539
he's got some very interesting tales to
tell and he's well on his reputation

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,260
our him speak for himself Ross approach
to have

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,560
mister Jason Scott here today the
well-known well claim PBS documentary

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,000
Islam smile from vintage computer
festival also to the niche tak

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,260
the principle I believe I will be in
shortly

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,890
I also like to say something we do have

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,750
a an exhibit of March the the landing
retro computing hobbies group

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,660
has proven exhibit retro computing and
miss Ravin competent seven here

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,729
where up beyond

25
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,190
the exhibit floor and you're welcome to
come down and see his gear set up in

26
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,800
love with all things to discuss

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,700
argue just a brief presentation get on
our speakers

28
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,210
not a single the best name systems Moby
Dick actually like to discuss very

29
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,240
briefly was actually an army system

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,440
their name for needy system mobile
digital computer

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,730
back in 1957 7

32
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,739
this is a point Germany by few units had
not in air conditioning systems

33
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,290
core memory room for expansion of core
memory a console

34
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,609
I this is your digital computer people
even the okay pros

35
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,530
now so you pretty decent actually worked
toward some

36
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,630
unified EU standards

37
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,410
Sheila machine arm

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:34,250
way back up leverage or Apple one was
around six hundred sixty six dollars if

39
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,970
you're fortunate enough to get one

40
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,160
a pic computing its finest other people
have other flavors you prefer

41
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,250
arm for Houston machine it processor

42
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,600
nothing like the multi hundred pin you
to get now though he

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,810
low dissipation simple instruction sets

44
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,710
I

45
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,510
other machines were necessary is pretty
even though we like to take a very thing

46
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,540
in the pure perfect

47
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,459
free have 1000 dollars you get twenty
makers machine not too long ago with a

48
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,190
tandy Benjani you can add a hard drive

49
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:11,540
few topics will be discussing

50
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,870
summer these you have summer although

51
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,480
generation machine to be free like such
as the Altair's arm

52
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
mister vinson reliably now California's
actually built is a real alternate

53
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,569
photographed we made a case

54
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,650
with the front was one inch thick
custom-designed logic

55
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,410
outer equivalent looks perfect like an
Altair

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,790
be a real computer when the case the
actual alter componentry

57
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,790
is only the first inch-thick you swing
open your

58
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,940
your Altair gots and you got your
machine behind it

59
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:45,030
you are fully functioning Altair I last
time I spoke to me that the person is

60
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,959
opcode was done beautiful job and looks

61
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,160
I can alter arm will be discussed the
village computer festival

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,299
and if you've you may know that if I
know that there might be briefly mention

63
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,849
okay I move on to our speakers

64
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,920
and shortly before the end we leave room
for questions for speaker on introduces

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,709
Richard Cheshire

66
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:14,450
Cheshire Cat Alice thank you

67
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,910
I'm just no iPhone freedom computers

68
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,989
so since yesterday so I actually sold
them

69
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,610
39th Street near 67 place called the
computer store

70
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,409
going fidgeting the placard 1977

71
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,990
I was looking at twenty years ago time I
walked into the store

72
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,949
I just hold down the fort for the day
phone right so if the computer store as

73
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:36,199
a

74
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,180
the abacus torque powers

75
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,919
out lost couldn't get a win said fun

76
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,378
a we sold the L 3800 both as

77
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,129
kit for and fully built up for for
business people

78
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:56,550
mostly the people going over 230 Street
Madison

79
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,400
where i stand. had the computer market
New York

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,499
stan had apples and Apple's Head visit
Cal

81
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,569
this account was the tail the whack the
Apple

82
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,960
dog because there's a cup was the first
real spreadsheet program

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,489
for personal computers over today all
later with the idea PC came along

84
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,930
voters emulate it with a program called
123

85
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,139
at the business market is shifted idea

86
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,419
Wii U played with computers though still
fun ways to play with this stuff

87
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:37,279
and that's what I my buddies that that's
why still make no real books and other

88
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,210
stuff since it was just playing with the
stuff

89
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,248
lecture which tales past the

90
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:47,499
the game too but the topic up today

91
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:51,180
was it's just was bored bored systems

92
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,289
other bulletin board systems were the
first real outreach

93
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,949
from personal computers to other people
with personal computers

94
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,659
it's what first got hackers talking to
each other

95
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:05,020
a the University of course had the
ARPANET

96
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,789
in those days and universities to talk
to each other

97
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:11,878
but what people could get personal
computers in their homes hook up the

98
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,889
phone lines with

99
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:17,069
modems the board work phenomena started

100
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,059
and took off for a while about ten or
fifteen year period

101
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:25,569
to Skype wiped out the local words

102
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,379
people would set these things up

103
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,020
would die away and login

104
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,169
you've got to be week if you could get
out the whole bunch different both

105
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,128
boards and get accounts on

106
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:43,050
was just whole phenomena people chatting
with each other

107
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,229
via teletype basically your

108
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,389
video terminal usually was just knows
ATM free with that

109
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,969
only put text on the screen and chat
back and forth

110
00:06:54,969 --> 00:06:59,110
it's hard to relate how much fun that
was because you're doing with technology

111
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,029
and hardware

112
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,219
today you've got your IRC chat said you
know that I could

113
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:08,330
my mother today this

114
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:14,119
yeah my mother was the most
anti-technology person in the world like

115
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:17,919
email today's troop that she's out lol

116
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,039
I stop loving you people a long time ago
cuz at least they were

117
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,039
online they were starting to learn

118
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,669
and half the battle is good because open
up their minds to start

119
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,219
the learning process with this stuff so

120
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:35,580
I'm grateful that the world discover out

121
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,839
where it's not just geeks like me

122
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,969
that brings its own problems of course

123
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,919
but because the keys to talk to each
other we got things to chat about

124
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,068
and we're not out to hurt nobody else
will our technology

125
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,559
it's when he gets out in the real world
with will problems

126
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,589
that problems step book we

127
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:59,589
world too busy just having fun stuff

128
00:07:59,589 --> 00:08:03,460
and so writer computing to me is going
back to a day

129
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,580
when I consider my the m3 im just out of
my mode and

130
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,929
find out who had what information which
both boards

131
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:17,029
and lot of fun for me

132
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,210
budget is gonna go hello there everyone
names Jason Scotland X-files dot com

133
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,399
I i do occasional other things and other
reason I started a cycle text files

134
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,009
dot com was because in 1998 I looked
around

135
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,479
to find out information about bolt
imports online specifically I was

136
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,330
looking for one

137
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,229
specific bulletin board called Sherwood
Forest to which was a huge freak

138
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,339
Baltimore located just up here around
saugerties

139
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,410
the up Baltimore had all these wonderful
text files we could go on

140
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,649
learn about things in this is why I
first learned about them something

141
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,190
called the black box

142
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,579
which was basically this box that a
jammed up the voltage

143
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:55,100
on a phone such that the equipment
thought that the phone was still ringing

144
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,160
even though you could talk to somebody
in between really loud unpleasant

145
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,279
buzzing but hey you know it's free so

146
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,009
there were a number of these text files
and by their very nature these were text

147
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:07,949
files that felt like spells they felt
like these

148
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:11,380
a little incantations were just with a
couple special

149
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,720
up pieces of electronic equipment you
could

150
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,410
have an effect on the world you could
either be able to

151
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,740
freak people out you could get things
for free you could

152
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,190
%uh learn things really quickly that
other people didn't know so

153
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,180
these little text files were really
important to me and with that of course

154
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,529
the community of people who were trading
in them

155
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,439
so in 1998 being a decrepit 28-year-old
ice decided look back on my

156
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,959
and my childhood and try to compel sure
would force to in found I couldn't find

157
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,620
anything about it which was weird

158
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,220
couldn't search it could find anything
with it and I start looking for other

159
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,209
Baltimore to New York area

160
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,660
couldn't find anything on them and the
okay fine PBS's anything with that

161
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,819
and almost nothing so at that point I
said okay something's wrong

162
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:58,300
so when I was a youth I use to log onto
these will comport systems

163
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,560
and be a leech and in people each

164
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,879
which is a concept that still sticks
around today the idea love I take

165
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,899
everything in give you nothing

166
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,560
which works out really well for me and
so what happened

167
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,350
was that I wasn't unbelievable each
would log onto these Baltimore systems

168
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,519
and download every single text file that
I could find

169
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,220
and I kept the I printed them outright
put them on floppy disks

170
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,680
so was a a small problem to go home

171
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,910
go to the basement get the discs the
floppy disks

172
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,240
find out which ones work dead from being
around for about twenty years

173
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,300
and then put them all up on a site and
text files dot com was

174
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,930
open for business started out with up
now

175
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,639
its 4,000 5,000 text files that grew to
twenty thousand

176
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,550
and one of the things that it did was it
became kinda hot spot for people talking

177
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,370
about Baltimore's

178
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,519
now when you had a baltimore system you
have to understand that you just had a

179
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,459
computer hooked up to a single phone
line

180
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:00,579
the people who use double support system
for we start this weren't that great

181
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,540
yeah just sayin

182
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,569
so people don't go out another the
talking about the bad times these were

183
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:08,860
actually pretty good times

184
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,920
they were slower and that's the thing
that people forget

185
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,599
is that every time I look back into
computer history what's often forgotten

186
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,910
is the time

187
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,579
in a world where you can pull up in
Windows XP

188
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:24,149
the thumbnail view as an option to a
directory images

189
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,199
which represents a 12-hour process in
the old days of pulling up each

190
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:32,100
image to look at it and letting it
render so that you could see the

191
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,120
J pay which wasn't the girl you thought
it was gonna be

192
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
on now you know you don't even think
that many people look back at time you

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,310
say well

194
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,579
they only have this Baltimore only has
eight hundred images

195
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,279
big deal what was that and the answer is
well that represented several years of

196
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,279
careful collecting by these people

197
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,360
because with many people imports they
were single home computer

198
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,370
hooked up to a phone line with a couple
floppy disks with someone

199
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,600
call upon a person's number and there is
an entire

200
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,889
some set a baltimore systems that we
started on people's phone lines

201
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,410
without the permission of the main a a

202
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,949
funders have the phone line and the
creators of the

203
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:15,220
vault aborts its top who a would find
out there getting calls all hours

204
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,290
day and night so they would have to get
their own phone lines

205
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:21,290
so for some people this represented a
financial hardship to get

206
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,319
a computer that you dedicated just
letting others come on and do stuff

207
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:28,389
so basically with these are computer
bulletin board systems

208
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:33,110
um overtime people could post messages
but it might take

209
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,850
a month for really good conversation
thread to the kind of work itself out on

210
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,129
abort abort

211
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,689
um and there was a much stronger sense
in one way

212
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:45,910
community because it was often
location-based because

213
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,370
as you might recall in the old days when
you could just pick up Skype

214
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,790
call everybody right now for free %uh

215
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,819
calling people was a major deal if you
were gonna leave

216
00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:01,269
your county so a these Baltimore often
became

217
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:05,410
really big hangouts locals so everyone
could say hey let's all go to Shakeys

218
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,579
pizza

219
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:09,810
and everyone would immediately know that
would have to be an explanation whereas

220
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:14,259
back now you say that someone's like
while it's nowhere near Japan

221
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:17,430
so um the

222
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,509
Baltimore a community's that existed
back then

223
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:23,639
were extremely strong extremely person
based

224
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,199
on one of the things that sometimes for
gotten with look at the whole technology

225
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:30,509
that many times the community-based it
sometimes not

226
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,970
the the fact that the main framework
slowly the fact that

227
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,579
this give you an opportunity to go
outside and smoke with all your buddies

228
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:40,329
and you really became good friends with
for that stupid big box to finish what I

229
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,399
was doing

230
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,040
on so with the ball to word um

231
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,360
text file collection that I had text
files dot com I decided

232
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,800
wouldn't be kind of neat to go through
these bought imports system numbers

233
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,889
because at the time they were that was
the life love abort abort system

234
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:57,829
call my number call my number call my
number now it's calmer website common

235
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:58,850
words like on my website

236
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,189
workbook so people with leave their
phone numbers

237
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:05,209
in the text files so did you enjoy
reading about

238
00:14:05,209 --> 00:14:08,569
how to screw-up mcdonald's well just
call the

239
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:12,220
the Greek in or the enchanted toilet
which is one of my favorite names

240
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,300
or um you know the the utopia was
another wonderful

241
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,379
and people would call them but as a
result

242
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,350
I had a list of hundreds and hundreds of
phone numbers I had this stupid idea

243
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,759
and as we all know wonderful things
sometimes come from stupid ideas

244
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,279
and my stupid idea was would be kinda
need to kinda Khalid all of them into

245
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,910
one big list

246
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,040
so I went through in written scripts and
start pulling out

247
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,170
all the scripts a a VOB text but
basically text file phone numbers

248
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,160
and ended up with a list of about 40,000
PBS's

249
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,339
in the first week and I suddenly found a
hundred thousand

250
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:53,670
about 205,000 now and I thought well
that's kinda cute project

251
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,009
is next to you now you can go here and
say well back then here's the kind of

252
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,800
boards that you would have been able to
choose from in your town

253
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,810
what I didn't realize was that it was a
honey pot for memories

254
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,879
people with six for their own name I'm
told the white one other people were

255
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:06,509
interviewed

256
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,930
told me he was dating a girl things were
second third date

257
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,680
things were looking good and one day she
was on the phone so

258
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,759
what was castle in the air and that was
able to board system

259
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,499
run twenty two years before when he was
11

260
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:26,019
up for three-month on his parents fun

261
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,459
and he was like but it and so um I get
people who search for their names and

262
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:34,939
it's like oh by the way hi remember from
1986 to 1988 when you ran this bulletin

263
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:36,050
board system

264
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,559
and so people write me and say wow
that's really nice you doing that some

265
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:40,209
people right

266
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:44,069
hey stop doing that but most people
right hey that's pretty cool

267
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,490
in fact let me tell you a little story
about the ball to court system

268
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,129
and so people right to me it wouldn't
just be a little stories that would be

269
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:51,040
massive

270
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,149
massive novels about everybody the met
everything they did the stories for the

271
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:55,889
planned

272
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:59,559
and I said you know it just occurs to me
I don't think anybody's really done a

273
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,920
history on this

274
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,240
you know say will see basically there
were huge mainframes and at some point

275
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,360
there was Alan Turing and then later
there was a phone your modem then

276
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,009
home internet so we thought they look a
lot like

277
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,329
which I could do something with this now
I had a film degree which I didn't use

278
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,019
and I thought you I think it's time to
make that film so off I said in 2001

279
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:25,850
200 interviews thousands of miles later
I ended up finishing in 2004

280
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,399
and travel through Canada and United
States and

281
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,100
interviewed people who created bulletin
board software use ball to boards

282
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,449
%uh who had had their lives changed able
to board both positively and negatively

283
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,490
talk to hackers talk two crackers talk
to people who just ran businesses for a

284
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:41,790
while

285
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,189
a lot of fun what I found was some
amazing stories

286
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:48,420
so I ended up making a documentary
called BBS

287
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,329
the documentary because I didn't think
there's gonna be any others

288
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,740
so mom thats BBS documents we got calm
if you wanna browse all that stuff

289
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,759
mama and I end up creating you know and
because we

290
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:05,730
you know if you do it don't do it happen
ass on it's five and a half hours long

291
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,480
innate episode seeking peace out comic
covers Fido net NC

292
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,660
art it covers a up happened

293
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,820
cracking it covers the entire PBS's and
cover something rather obscure

294
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:21,329
or not scared some %uh view how many
people he remembered the

295
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,810
arc zip battles 1988

296
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,899
excellent one of them and died a drunk
in a hotel room

297
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,190
on in up couple years ago one of them

298
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:36,280
is simply a broken man from it and i got
to interview him

299
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,600
and I cover the whole story and it's a
very interesting story that when you

300
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,650
type that zip

301
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:44,860
at the end of compression there are two
broken families behind that story

302
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,030
and has a lot of things where you have
these human side to the technology

303
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:52,360
so when I do these when I'm doing my
work text files that common all these

304
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,970
other things

305
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,220
I'm trying to find the human side story
because that's where the fun is

306
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,090
you know it's not so much the fact that
you know we've talked to me about that

307
00:17:59,090 --> 00:17:59,990
the history they don't go

308
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:03,560
all that I was able to move this
register over here

309
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,590
that was prideful moment a lot of times
they'll say

310
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:11,659
I was able to move this register over
here and that showed the Helena Phil

311
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,870
feel cried so you know that's

312
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,010
which often find it is the human side so
I ended up

313
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,450
um anyway so in terms of both import
systems

314
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:25,100
um this is a few interesting things that
are worth keeping track of with

315
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,360
that history that I'll mention bomb
certainly

316
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,380
um from the early eighties on work there
was an amateur

317
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,620
network of Fido net which was started by

318
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,380
a crazy gay skate punk name.com Jennings
who would work

319
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,420
on among other things the phoenix bios
and was one of the

320
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,550
architects that and he went of and
created

321
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,919
able to board system that could send
messages to another bulletin board

322
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,690
system which sounds like a basic

323
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:53,810
understandable thing but it really
wasn't on

324
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,600
it was like everyone saying what's my
cost all this money and he basically

325
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,720
came up first with the system with a
call each other and leave it

326
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,080
you should really pick that up and oMG
you could

327
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,720
leave messages and have it automatically
overnight during the magic our

328
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,310
call the wrong person with them up but
then eventually call the right person

329
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,980
the message and this move to an
extremely complicated

330
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,500
net node system that exists to this day
where

331
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,010
hundreds of Baltimore systems mostly in
developing countries now

332
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,110
automatically call route messages all
through the world

333
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,770
all done using amatures always people on
their computers

334
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,690
sometimes they didn't have to join the
main that they could have their own will

335
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:33,480
not have six computers that or made
themselves redundant

336
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,890
you know redundancy is something that we
often lose now is often a lot of

337
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,390
dedication with things

338
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:42,620
to a have a website and then you find
out the hard way that that website is

339
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,030
gone and this facilities to do with it
but you know for everything we have like

340
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,580
Usenet which is existing on all these
different computers a lot abort abort

341
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,050
system history is lost

342
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:56,250
because that computer got turned into
the thrown out computer

343
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,320
so you know there's a lot of lost
history that its

344
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,360
lost weight ok go away the um

345
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,730
system um the the one piece it review
which I do wanna give you

346
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,310
is that arm often when people talk abort
abort system history

347
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,409
they say all there were um

348
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,530
rocks and stones and then there were
mainframes and people were doing

349
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,970
something with networks

350
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,470
but then there was brought to court
systems and then was the internet

351
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,450
I had the opportunity in the pleasure of
talking to bomb

352
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,820
word christiansen who created X modem a

353
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,850
a really nice script program which
nobody knows about

354
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,190
and a um the based on what became the
first

355
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,550
dial-up Bolton court system and what he
tells me is he created Exmoor

356
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,139
which was the old days you see when you
sent something across phone lines

357
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,340
it's sucked so it would get corrected if
you can just imagine

358
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,120
lasting a text file down dirty phone
line

359
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,030
to pick it up on the other side and
hoping at the other end it becomes

360
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,139
pac-man

361
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,230
um you know everything that could
possibly go wrong will go wrong

362
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,290
so what were did was he was inspired
reading about various things

363
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,310
various ideas to come up with a protocol

364
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,639
where we go pay here some data did you
get it

365
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,340
sounds simple he did and created this
thing called X modem and it just

366
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,540
happened to be because he was using it
to transfer CPM

367
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,680
because he had to get onto a new machine
didn't have any CPM on it didn't have an

368
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,790
operating system

369
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,730
so he kinda wrote this thing so that
they could blasted into a tape recorder

370
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,330
then blasted back out again into a modem
and allow the thing

371
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,429
to all has only had one modem to

372
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,860
install the suffering system because so
that immediate 128

373
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,200
bite blocks which turned out to be just
what he needed so he creates Exmoor

374
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,260
well this thing goes everywhere by the
way it was originally called modem you

375
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,640
can imagine how much fun that

376
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,990
cost so X modem was so cool

377
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,430
that some guys on the ARPANET said meant
your 8 p.m.

378
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,890
bitch we're gonna give you access to the
ARPANET

379
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:01,000
so they the blue a were christiansen
onto the ARPANET for free

380
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,250
just for being in war christiansen so
they were doing impacted 76 77

381
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,610
so he's on there and it was like you
know these new micro computers are kinda

382
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,330
cool

383
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,620
it be kinda cool if someone could folded

384
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,650
and leave a message wouldn't be me

385
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,180
and then the office that are out there
each other be fat so he

386
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,060
basically said come on

387
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,320
and so he sat down with the gentleman in
branding sues

388
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,820
who was the hardware guide who some

389
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,060
basically set so what do we need this
thing to do and when the how we do it

390
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,350
let's do it let's do it let's do it

391
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:39,370
and they wanted to bring it to their
computer club and he said no it'll never

392
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,230
get done

393
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,210
so they went off in a did this and they
created in about two weeks but nobody

394
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,510
would believe it was created two weeks
so they officially called a month

395
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,580
so in fact its February 1st but nobody
knows that it's February

396
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,460
16 is the official date that Baltimore
system February 16 1978 is the first

397
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,180
day that Baltimore systems were
functioning and I'll mention quickly how

398
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,590
their auto answer workers again this is
a big what now we're losing auto answer

399
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,300
right

400
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,770
yes we are but you know modems with
answer the phone

401
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,080
and then say hey but that's not how they
did it

402
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,250
because they didn't really have an auto
answer

403
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,620
routines with the did instead was the
hook something up to the phone line

404
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:21,200
so that if the notice that the voltage
up the phone rang it would

405
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
reboot the system and the since the
system was relatively small

406
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,020
load the microcode fast enough and
assume that when it got reboot somebody

407
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,660
was calling it an answer

408
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,690
so basically that's how the packed or no
answer now

409
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,860
on Atari computers they did the at the
joystick for

410
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,710
watching so when it said somebody's
press into the left it must be a phone

411
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,200
call

412
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,260
so you know people think that to start
out a certain way

413
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,129
really does um I don't for time I feel
their own

414
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,710
Minister I don't know kato alright we'll
keep going

415
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,020
alright go with their so um in doing

416
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,200
able to board system documentary another
group that I covered

417
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,740
and see artists have the nineteen
nineties and now this is an out against

418
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,590
the thing

419
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,260
a call out these changes raise your hand
you go of course okay let's go with

420
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:11,740
ice full acid

421
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,800
excellent up and so

422
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,600
these two groups I San acid with the two
big ones basically

423
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,960
in on PC computers the implemented a
poor subset

424
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,420
of this standard that was around from
the 1970s that allows you to do

425
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,710
ball linking color if you're capable
love it and so on

426
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,850
basically what a lot of people took the
vt100 codes or whatever

427
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:35,970
well Microsoft showing great

428
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,260
precedence in their way to work
implemented a poor subset a bit

429
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,930
you know later version of DOS called and
speed up this

430
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:47,230
and the reason is called anted up this
was because it was implementation

431
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,360
love american National Standards
Institute a

432
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,870
South number exiting with X

433
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:58,610
is something dashed 1979 in other words
one of their many thousands of standards

434
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,790
what's caught and see it's like coming
out with an

435
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,220
new car park calling it car

436
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,290
dot sis so basically

437
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:13,670
and C dot sis was a part of it which
would allow them to use color

438
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:16,670
and on the PC there were slightly you
know with ASCII

439
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:21,030
which will bury you there's basically
the first 128 characters

440
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,320
and then it's this chaotic anarchic free
fall with all the rest microcomputers

441
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,370
so on when you get a smiley face on the
when you block when you get another a

442
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,800
you know we just don't know what you're
going to get one the PC you got a solid

443
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,590
character

444
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,950
slightly dotty character couple slashes
in a few other things

445
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,110
so destroying the basic concept at the
modem which is the lower

446
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:46,240
people a very difficult purist all
communicate without having to worry

447
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,340
about that shit

448
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,860
they started putting in special things
or only work on a Commodore 64 it would

449
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,130
only work on it are you would only work
on a PC

450
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:58,150
I'll stick with the PC group the PC
group had basically NC that SIS and they

451
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,730
could send

452
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,320
control coat over 27 you could draw a
little house

453
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,480
not a great house but we're a little
tiny house that's it welcome to the

454
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,990
telescoping head

455
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,260
PBS and you would have little house will
tell school

456
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:14,580
cool and this was a big deal but they
were very basic they're very basic drawn

457
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,230
on mom you know two-dimensional kinda

458
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,440
you know like put your hand down to make
the turkey kinda crap so

459
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,950
what happens is that in the early
bullied 80's early 90's their sex 3some

460
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,960
artist like ebony eyes and so on

461
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,500
start creating pretty good art
respecting he's just a bunch of blocks

462
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,100
and over 80 by 25 because that's what
you can edit it using a program called

463
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,920
the drawee in Davis who doesn't want to
talk to me

464
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,650
and the um later programs

465
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:47,440
would allow you to scroll keep in mind
right now we look at you just had the

466
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,190
kind of like

467
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,270
you know doing the painting by using a
little magnifying glass

468
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,190
you can't quite see the whole painting
well so what these kids started to do

469
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,250
starting with a group called

470
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,100
aces NC art was let's make some and why
people would do this

471
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,050
some people wonder but basically these
kids we're gonna kick some ass with

472
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,600
computer art

473
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,600
and we're gonna make little graphic
images using these characters

474
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,480
and initially it starts out being like
it's that simple houses but then it's

475
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,020
like

476
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,389
Marvel characters rendered with 500
lines

477
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:19,880
taking the two months and at some point
they can't keep track

478
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,290
love all the stuff that's coming out
every month and so

479
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,770
Radmanovic acid create something called
the are packed with a basically say so

480
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,660
for October

481
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,340
here's our acquisition of all the cool
art this month here's another one

482
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,730
and by having a group called acid which
stands for and seek readers in demand

483
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,740
and ice which stands for in sync readers
enterprises

484
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,060
this of course starts competition starts
a scene

485
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,280
ever seen with politics you anger great
things started by anger

486
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,680
and you end up with up battle

487
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,030
to create the best free art that you can
get out there

488
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,030
and this thing reaches for the lip the
early part love

489
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,530
the nineties where groups are releasing
a hundred pieces

490
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:03,820
art all the beautiful trying to say
we're better than these other pacs

491
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,149
and there are literally dozens of groups
now this is why these things we say okay

492
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:08,020
well

493
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,230
why you telling me this and part of it
is that

494
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,580
it's kinda interesting to me how even on
this little tiny seems

495
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,710
tiny battles which to reach today right
I mean you have you have these little

496
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,880
things which happen in forums where
somebody becomes famous

497
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,450
because they posted a particularly
discuss the image in a disgusting image

498
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,690
travels everywhere

499
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:30,530
everyone remembers that image you know
threat of goats

500
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:34,040
everywhere and you know goats as they
say

501
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,610
good say has its roots in now you know

502
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:41,290
these competitions to say look everyone
I've done something I would add

503
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:42,230
something to it

504
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,450
again the human side um

505
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,740
that was very hot wasn't it yes and a

506
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,210
just mention one other group I've had to
deal with um in

507
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,900
you know when when we think over weir's
group now

508
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,500
all of us were watching a really bad for
Genova OVA OVA show

509
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,110
you know shaky cam and stuff om you know
there you have a case where

510
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,230
the activity done by the pirating group
is either a they know somebody who can

511
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,830
get them a copy of it and they give you
the copy

512
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,909
or be they can sneak a camera into a
movie theater so you can watch

513
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:19,240
you know Julia Roberts had lower back
and forth for 20 minutes

514
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,620
mom but what used to be the case was
with computer software

515
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:27,520
it was a major deal to find all the
special copy protection that was put

516
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,840
inside a program

517
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,380
just and in some cases layers upon
layers with dead ends

518
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,620
and so peep the problem is the people
who creating it

519
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,230
a and the people who could break such
software were about the same age with

520
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:40,260
about the same

521
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,780
experience in computers so there was
this interesting battle to

522
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,820
take software crack it down and

523
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,419
initially it was just simply to break
not so much debris protection

524
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,960
but the fact that with modems it took so
long again

525
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,440
it could take you a few hours to
transfer 143k floppy

526
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,270
from one apple 22 another you set that
sucker going you went out and got a

527
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:02,960
burger

528
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,720
when you got back if you were lucky you
got karateka

529
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,470
maybe so one of the things that the
crack you guys would do is they would

530
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,300
crack it and figure out what part of
that this was just the program

531
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,790
and crack it down to you know a 50k
program

532
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,000
season our multiplied by 100 devours

533
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,690
from all the people who were downloading
it so there was almost a skill set

534
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:29,370
involved in it that was so worthy of
pride that they would actually change

535
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,980
the program to put their names on it

536
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:35,390
so they would say hello we're with the
Buccaneers we just crack

537
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,460
crisis mountain and here you can you
know

538
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,520
call our Baltimore which if you think
about this pretty crazy

539
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:46,090
you know it's like hey here's this
illegal copy of Star Wars

540
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:51,440
right to me but they did this caller
Bolton board system

541
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,000
so these crackers a have gone on to

542
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,390
wonderful %uh you know and and of course
the names were burned in my memory we're

543
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,200
talking twelve hundred Club back black
bag society cracker what's

544
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,630
a slight crack a bitch um I had the
pleasure was a nice effect subduing

545
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:12,210
UK but as I said shut up what you say
two more minutes before shut up

546
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,300
okay do that I had the pleasure

547
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,400
through my Baltimore system documentary
and stuff in this is

548
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,050
one of the benefits people say
somebody's been all this time travel

549
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:22,909
around talking to people you but we just
sit home

550
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:26,560
let X files and be done with it but
through my work I'm able to meet some

551
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,440
really amazing people I had the pleasure
of spending an hour with an answer

552
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,800
talkable towards which he doesn't know
much about by the way

553
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,830
but he's forgiven and stir for concerts
like a

554
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:40,000
track down a lot of these crackers now

555
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,510
have families were living all over the
place who remember noticed

556
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,770
suddenly kick in there suddenly 12 years
old again figure out how to crack crisis

557
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,560
mountain

558
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,050
and there was one gentleman I was down
to two people left

559
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:55,639
who I couldn't reach om that I couldn't
find one was black agent double O three

560
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,740
who's a great gentleman and someone in
cracker bitch

561
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:02,610
who created the cracking tutorials the
crack in corner series

562
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,600
which was just this beautiful me this
was a how to file that to shut up

563
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,720
the told you how to crack Apple to
software you know it's one thing to say

564
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,790
we finished it

565
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,340
trust us with your rock is nothing to
sit down with you and say

566
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,340
here's how I did it you know that's
important

567
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:22,220
not everyone has that urgent cracker
bitch did so I made an attempt to find

568
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,070
crack a bitch

569
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,210
records contacted me through a
double-blind system because his son

570
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,260
up found it I don't know who I don't
know cracker which is name

571
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,650
where he's located I simply know that he
is in his sixties any runs an aerospace

572
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:36,840
company

573
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,530
and just simply doesn't want anyone to
know because he's the CEO of an

574
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,540
aerospace company

575
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,020
of some sort I think maybe he's like

576
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,889
but up he pulled me how he had a friend

577
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,890
who was going through a really
depressing time who

578
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,850
was kouassi suicidal to seem like this
friend had no motivation

579
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,460
and so cracker bitch wanting to do
something for his friend

580
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,810
started to write the cracking for
nurseries to say well

581
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:08,389
okay life seems kinda down right now but
you could do something illegal

582
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,680
and look how complicated is to commit
this crime let me show you how

583
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,570
and so he wrote this for his friend and
then turn them into the series

584
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,139
and that's the kinda stuff you just
gonna lose that's nowhere else in on

585
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,100
these Health Minister

586
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,680
it happened out okay alright so yeah I
fold

587
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,680
thank you very much

588
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,600
but by the way so amazing to tell you
this but

589
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,750
10 the rules of life is that Britain's
thinks you're some crazy guy was really

590
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,740
into something

591
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,600
that person always personally know
someone who kicks his ass makes him feel

592
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,150
normal

593
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:47,300
Selam is my makes me feel normal

594

600
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,740
but try real CF card do more projection

601
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:15,409
the meantime our years-long so I'm is
Mel

602
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:21,010
and basically a computer collector

603
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:24,450
well

604
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:29,080
I was able to for Turner basically
created for an acquittal

605
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,399
years this is how I did it basically

606
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,759
I grew up in here that Jason I motored
around you know

607
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,080
call Greg PBS's and stuff like that got
active in the sea

608
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,340
I was in the apt to world I

609
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:52,060
demands or delayed on the tail the
decline of the great civilizations where

610
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,810
you know air basically was world

611
00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:00,009
more error occurred I was at the end of
the year 0

612
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,650
ladies I was the Rams acker right you
know did some

613
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,980
free the some workplaces myself crack

614
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,300
for and I'll that was my thing I i

615
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:16,740
engaged in all this modem work stuff the
flame wars

616
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,640
treaty the software

617
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,690
competing with other are group you know
so was always

618
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,320
teenagers with way too much for moms
running around

619
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,330
competing against each other's you can
inflict

620
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:38,069
more economic damage on software
companies is really interesting but

621
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,830
basically

622
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,980
at a certain point in time you know you

623
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,210
though those days were not you know
always as far as you

624
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:49,970
remember the others started back to mess
or to work creates the

625
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,690
computer collector everybody at some
point wants to go back to

626
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,050
find their first computer had access to

627
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:02,800
that's what we've got

628
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,230
I was remember one day I was walking

629
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:10,460
flea market and a walk westall with

630
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:14,390
all these all the computers from me
calmer or

631
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,299
picked warnings party 100 GI 99 all
these computers that I couldn't afford

632
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,780
and so I kinda

633
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,440
no struck them all out side

634
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,880
I could have all these and

635
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,150
so I I went around the corner those
myself

636
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,650
in back in how much

637
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:40,820
you want for all these as I go here's a

638
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,070
auto have a five books each

639
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:49,920
nose like soul so I filled my trunk
ahead a little hard to see the film in

640
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,350
truck

641
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,920
with like 20 3 these different machines

642
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,210
basically for 100 bucks and so I went
home

643
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:03,990
took them all out lovingly them all
tested each one

644
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,380
tinkered with the ones are working most
or benham

645
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,070
you messed around her for a while and
then lovingly packed them away

646
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,980
in anti-static bags from

647
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,130
from in a box nice perfect source set
them aside

648
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,410
so this was my collection for a while

649
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:28,390
had computers that are accumulated from
when I was younger

650
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,279
there's there's also those two types a
computer quarters collector

651
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,690
reactor was accumulator so most people

652
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:39,090
are the Securities just you by a
computer

653
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,820
when you upgrade no get really only

654
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,920
finding purpose or you just don't have
the heart so

655
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,820
to collectors the latter you don't have
a heart

656
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,970
through so first my collection services

657
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:56,700
cumulation collection I guess the the

658
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,180
remark but that was it for about you
know

659
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:05,750
for a long time I got involved work
versions of Word

660
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,930
and down and then one day

661
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,540
with this on the Internet I saw a
message on Usenet

662
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,740
some posted and said if you are
interested in all computers are starting

663
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,500
mailings

664
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,920
prosecutors you wanna join semi

665
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,920
while you know up until this point

666
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,570
I didn't realize there is other people
out there strange notion that

667
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:33,120
you know holding onto inching computers
was somehow normal

668
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,560
I had always justified it by saying that
you know when they'll

669
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,330
sorry computers my mom's those but all
the computers I have power

670
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,560
all want to sell some you know solo mom
you know some user

671
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,960
classics in on them they're gonna be a
museum piece

672
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,080
and this is true actually literally

673
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,420
museum so

674
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,920
when I found out that there is other
people out there same ideas

675
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,460
well this is interesting so join the
mailing list there is a core

676
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,500
about 25 people originally and

677
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,700
it was great was just use nerd have
because we just sit there and just talk

678
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,450
about the old days and talk about all

679
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,940
puters and share stories and things like
that

680
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,200
and and you just kind of got me really

681
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,300
interested you know researching a
further study it further

682
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,840
and so ice I started to go out to

683
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,860
for stores and flea markets and
electronic surplus of I'm

684
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,130
so about so its you know really
University

685
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,400
for this sort of thing every way fines

686
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,480
real computers you know like a all out
to use all

687
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,890
Tory computers tarde systems

688
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:54,220
yours the things that you never conceive
before you know it the many computers in

689
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,610
the seventies

690
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,860
PDP 11:30 the general stuff

691
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,680
mean for the back you know you started
size machines

692
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,160
but you know the thing is used to be
able to go out

693
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,720
there's tons use freehold computers from

694
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,860
from seventies and eighties that you
never had a chance to play were too

695
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,740
expensive

696
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,210
for and so I was making a lot of money
at the time

697
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,300
arm in the which they were really cheap
%um for five books sometimes and get a

698
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,170
free

699
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:26,490
you know I used to going post would post
messages

700
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,790
usiness a I want to buy your old ass
computers

701
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,750
and I would you all kinds responses from
that and some other people were just

702
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,870
you know they didn't want any money they
just wanted

703
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:40,100
they were just happy to know that it was
going to a good home somebody

704
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,700
preserving appreciate it because they
were the same you know they had that

705
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,760
same the stalled

706
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,540
the wanna throw away that computer serve
them

707
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,450
so well for so many years and also cross
so much money

708
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,490
and so just that the knowledge that he
was going to somebody who would really

709
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,360
appreciate

710
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,580
hold on to it rode out was

711
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:05,080
or something they were your but you know
they were cheap 5 10 bucks

712
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:09,549
20 bucks maybe for something big was
really more like a weight's

713
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,220
just scrap scrap

714
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,530
a a but now I'm have

715
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:19,920
actually I'm going to school later
somebody's

716
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,960
or computer some like some from the

717
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,110
seventies and everything thousands were
without

718
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:30,430
dollars it's gone court

719
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,120
so anyway I i was. I started
accumulating fortune rather quickly

720
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:39,299
also in my collection slope twenty to
thirty to 5200

721
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,910
100 you know it's was an insatiable
appetite

722
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,790
store cuz every was literally became an
addiction because you go out

723
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,160
find civil never heard foreigners

724
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,190
how you know that's something completely
new

725
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,380
rowdy run home with it try to get work

726
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,460
play around with it was just site
discovering some new

727
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,130
just like you know not unlike the
throwed from

728
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,850
different systems out there but I am

729
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,970
so this discontinued the computer
collector

730
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,070
mailing list ru and I started to realize
is a community-building

731
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:21,630
here and so i thought well community
like this means

732
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,440
like a convention of some sort so ice I
pitched the idea to the group

733
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,180
we thought it was recalls for positive
receive so I went ahead

734
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,100
sorted planning what was originally
gonna be called the classic computing

735
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,160
engine vintage your first

736
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,370
and it was held in October 25th and 26th

737
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:44,910
1997 and

738
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:50,190
about 150 people came

739
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:53,230
and that was have a disappointing
because I

740
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,700
lost about six thousand dollars terms of
organizing

741
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,560
quit it was the start some has now grown
to use

742
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,060
about half a dozen events worldwide

743
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,060
fire on very cities in your

744
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,380
your States or word

745
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,260
and now

746
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:20,400
ok I Selam

747
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,750
till the assembled attics how many
computers you currently have in your

748
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,590
warehouse

749
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,770
okay are getting a sec okay I'm after

750
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:33,280
okay so so then the

751
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,830
my collection was growing outgrew my

752
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:40,109
my three-car garages literally took up
the whole thing

753
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:43,310
boxes piled force you all

754
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,970
a then had to move it out to storage

755
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,130
got a warehouse a small dollars for

756
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,700
I have all the room all over me I and
then

757
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,950
that moved into larger warehouse I was
given space

758
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,370
with a non-profit computer recycling
place

759
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:06,600
and Oakland the Alameda County computer
Resource Center

760
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,430
and that was very generous thing for my
collection

761
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:15,259
continue to grow rather rapidly because
now all the sudden I had access to

762
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,600
all this incoming stream

763
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,960
report electronic waste or

764
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,750
and so it eventually I

765
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:29,680
had to leave we I the move my collection
the business was moving there was no

766
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,390
room for me

767
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:35,080
replace and so I had to scramble fine

768
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:38,840
some way to store something over 2,000
computers

769
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,940
thousands of books manuals magazines

770
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:46,050
software video games you name it was

771
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,550
in a men's collection and so

772
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,750
I ended up moving it to a warehouse

773
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,950
in the city where which is Livermore and

774
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:59,240
45 underscore for house I lost count

775
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,280
over coming but I think the

776
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,840
I think 37 mac plus is my

777
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,090
kinda yardstick never have too many

778
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,190
up there's I have over 2000 computers

779
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,530
terms he models is probably over 1000

780
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,680
like I mentioned I have literally
thousands of books

781
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,799
ever huge library I have

782
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,590
books man manuals computer documentation

783
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:32,040
software for all different platforms

784
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,380
posters t-shirts mugs computer games you
notice all

785
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:40,040
as have to do you I was

786
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,930
I just kinda took on I I felt my role is

787
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,370
was to be basically archivist a very
most people

788
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,589
ifs or click to your computer's day

789
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:54,820
usually you know kinda grab whatever
fine they can find it first

790
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,830
after a while they sorta start for why
never developed

791
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,529
for just love period

792
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:05,710
so my my goal was to service

793
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,930
so by this point though of course you
know 4500

794
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:12,220
square foot warehouse california's
cheapest

795
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,340
so I started a electronics recycling
business

796
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,690
to offset the cost warehouse in

797
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,780
since 2008 actually salt was

798
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,790
turn this obsession to this with people
basically

799
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,140
have fun and I cater to all kinds
different businesses

800
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:34,250
biggest clients are attorneys creditors
because I provide

801
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:38,280
nation support attorneys come to me
looking for piece of hardware or

802
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,640
some software some Twitter patent more
than happy to oblige

803
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,310
a charger for my time for research I'll
so

804
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,580
rendell the materials and my question to
them

805
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:53,069
I do also this for hollywood no probs I
was

806
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,560
Yorkers providing teletype for

807
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,140
movie coming out six months Richard year

808
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:04,150
hopes data conversions or

809
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,870
thing from punch cards pretty track

810
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,980
what yes

811
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,060
of send it back to you

812
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,370
in this is with all the original or and
then

813
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,839
I do sales program for real high and

814
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,870
portable computers are sold for brokered
the sale for

815
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:29,140
ones after one was the first computer

816
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,430
was for Apple about 200 roommate

817
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:37,810
was exist today over the course the
years I've broken cell for these

818
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:42,470
responsible for fourteen thousand most
recent ones 28

819
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,570
these things are actually

820
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,990
and then I do appraisals

821
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,560
you appraisals for insurance purposes or

822
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,640
for duration starts

823
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,890
and other build replicas IPL

824
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:02,500
appears photos up anyway enough for this

825
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,710
same shameless self-promotion evolve

826
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,930
one when we get rolling like to give a
few more tidbits on

827
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:16,930
time when over

828
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:23,020
yes it will the only thing that I would
sugars

829
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,030
every summer Roubaix on and a

830
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:29,750
I'll first apologize for those babbling
on about myself so long

831
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,750
I don't it was interesting as the suffer
our teacher

832
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,760
a but you know speaking I just want to
give a

833
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,160
show a photo for replica I just go list

834
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,589
form because writer

835
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:48,380
alarm this is a pb1 this is due to quit

836
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:52,980
corporations first computer and I its
the significance of this is that it's

837
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,180
there

838
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,430
computer that the first video game
system was rigged space were so these

839
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,359
are becoming

840
00:48:58,359 --> 00:49:01,830
popular with the

841
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:04,900
with museums these days

842
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,740
a because the other documenting the
history of the information agent

843
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,210
you or so this is actually a replica of
all

844
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:16,040
functional replica the front panel is
actually functional got a PC and sizing

845
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:21,210
hardware updated your equipment
corporation pp1 circa 1961

846
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:26,680
school this way has the was also CRT
associated with this computer had

847
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:30,529
its this computer was basically a
personal computer what we know this

848
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:34,680
personal computer in nineteen sixty
graphics everything

849
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,810
and their were pertinent to this
discussion

850
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,520
go back %uh one or the other replicas I
just feel

851
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,900
is a boombox replica this is a

852
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,800
modeled after the blue box that steve
wozniak built for himself this is

853
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,780
personal

854
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:55,200
reeboks and

855
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,300
this is a functional will box of course
functional

856
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,930
I mean to use it anymore fortune

857
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,549
what's up fairly horrible for but anyway
that actually is a basic step inside and

858
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,440
generates the

859
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,890
proper tone trim signaling and stuff

860
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:16,460
anywhere if you have any questions I'll
be around

861
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:20,440
and we have to show you some more
photo's

862
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,520
you no answer trivia questions views

863
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,790
will be up by ham radio station after
talk

864
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:31,590
reaches up my alley wrap-up comment
everything else my life breaks down

865
00:50:31,590 --> 00:50:34,670
I throw for HH by for a sec

866
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:40,600
50 and I'm haha I just threw my
conclusions Austin speaker maker

867
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,260
every comment until the because of st.
to take questions

868
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,890
arm my thoughts

869
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:52,140
or with most important things one thing
I see thread throughout

870
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:55,140
advances in technology worthwhile all

871
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,120
works you have much more for choose the
freemen's tanker

872
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,319
when you buy technologies fishing now
there are restrictions

873
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,710
you know about that I was going on when
you buy technologies

874
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,390
freedom he works for many within an
extended young was intended to perform

875
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:15,069
that in and of itself is a worthwhile
task lot of

hearted

881
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,760
it's what you do with technology we want
to bring arm

882
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,420
we would make up for comment will take
questions

883
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:41,800
don't throw it out find the guy and you
know the guy

884

887
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:55,740
and they would like to ask questions
restraint

888
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:59,560
yes if one is work processing

889
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,100
files from old word processors that are
no longer supported boy

890
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,410
windows and programs

891
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:11,589
you recommend any for conversion
software that's who look into illegal

892
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:12,430
stuff like

893
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:16,170
early word store eager work perfect
things like that

894
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:20,730
there you won't find it you can

895
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:25,290
try to find a well I mean I could do it
for you

896
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,980
I have this offered this there you see
self-published

897
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,339
did this sort of thing but that was
switch for the

898
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:36,880
for for mister talk unified

899
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,250
I was doing a project with long now
foundation

900
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:45,040
last year we were trying to create an
online database

901
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,380
love this was called for Mac

902
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:52,569
for for cover basically idea what you
put in what your

903
00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:56,540
Witcher format was the files to be
anything in the pudding

904
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,700
target for me is like water PC

905
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,230
anyway it with show you a mapping up
three steps you have to go through to

906
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,050
convert from point A to point

907
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,710
you know these the for whatever our me
points between

908
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:12,870
to project never progressed

909
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:16,609
prototype him but if you contact me %uh

910
00:53:16,609 --> 00:53:19,620
my website is vintage tech Dakar that's
what this is

911
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,000
stacked slamming image tech talk on yes

912
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,480
L a am extractor com

913
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:30,660
will

914
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:34,109
my next question please actually I would
