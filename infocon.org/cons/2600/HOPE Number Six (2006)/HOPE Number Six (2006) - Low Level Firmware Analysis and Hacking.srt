1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,959
its time for low-level firmware analysis
and hacking

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,298
with John Maus amor number 67

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:14,299
you

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,820
you back phone through early for me and
I

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,740
flew in from Denver Senate's two hours
earlier she

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,740
this I'm sorry you need is in for me so
I can see it

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,420
aka

8
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,680
now said

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,860
and introduce myself my name is John ass
hammer and also known as much cheaper

10
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,090
I'm I'm my many views hacker

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,130
and my specialty recently has been the
CVS camcorder

12
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,200
and the one-time use disposable
camcorders

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,050
and still cameras and gone in December
from remember you know how to make

14
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,729
how they work and gone and an altered
them so that I can just connecting up to

15
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:14,610
non-computer

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,060
and my pictures zoo backgrounds
electrical engineering

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm with two biggest pair because
factors

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,170
I have too much time on my hands that's
why I've been act so much recently

19
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,010
so for those are you not familiar with
the cameras that I'm

20
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,470
play with on his acute quick history in
them

21
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,190
there are made by company name pure
digital iron

22
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,550
San Francisco and

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,810
the mic three still cams

24
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,820
and one camcorder on begun to different
variations different models

25
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,190
Anna they're still in business or so you
may want to venture capital

26
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,190
so natcher hospital yet but was the only
last

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,970
their basic business my own for our
cameras is as you

28
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,149
by the camera you take your picture to
your video

29
00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,950
when you return heard development and
then you get back to Prince

30
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,709
are either see the year DVD view media
it's pretty simple

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,710
it's just kinda expensive so I have to
take a break here

32
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,740
there's rules and a problem guy my notes
not showing

33
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,530
for some reason I'm

34
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,950
sorry again another sleep I'm

35
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,440
there

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,150
okay and this is the first camera from

37
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,720
first generation is released in 2003 it
has is a very basic camera scan just 25

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,700
pictures 1.2 megapixels

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,099
not even cutting edge for 2&3 from

40
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,920
minutes chief its 18 hours and if you
lose a UW breaking it's all OK

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,220
you know how much money I'm

42
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,330
to lock in that they had is a memory's
not expand

43
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,480
there's no slime nothing it's just I'm
built-in

44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,439
memory chip son andrew cunanan and PC
board

45
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,299
sue to get to them in which if you have
to go through their hydrant

46
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:29,299
their firmer and thats had been like %um
neck surgery camera

47
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,120
non-communicable years later I guess
maybe you later

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,040
on much much cheaper to produce the
first one was clearly a prototype that

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,790
the

50
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,859
the person production this one has a

51
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,530
much cheaper cases one easy to recycle
on

52
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,390
basically it's got the same same specs
is 25 pictures 1.1 megapixels

53
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,519
totally different processor chipset
everything

54
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,810
quien le to reverse engineering again
user starting from scratch because

55
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,560
everything was different mean everything
so the big

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,290
feature this camera is that it has a
picture preview anna has an LCD screen

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,340
and they don't a price limit is 18 hours
on

58
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,010
actually and one was eleven dollars and
you can

59
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,730
see the pictures you takin you can use
the the the screen

60
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,350
action this from a church can you screen
is a preview

61
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,190
annum and if you don't like which you
can delete it

62
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:35,160
and there's a big old LeBron on their
and most recently

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,100
and I last year became it with her
generation which is their first

64
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,990
camcorder

65
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,830
and its it's basically the

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,169
not a camper in the traditional sense
it's more like a still camera that takes

67
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,130
video users

68
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,540
just has not been you action in a moment
so

69
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,140
it's got built in memory on not for 20
minutes it takes said

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:00,900
really require resolution for BJ 30
frames per second

71
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,740
skin and take for decoders ads is no
lightweight it's

72
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,150
it's pretty nice on just 20 minutes and
then you've still got home

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,370
pricing model in traditional has Intel

74
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,520
and I

75
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,520
in this is when the features that
they've got that turn

76
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,880
current challenges people on there's a

77
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,530
sticker on and says explicitly and I
cannot be connected to TV or computer

78
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,919
incidents Justin challenge to me and
others its gonna

79
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,139
gonna happen huh to

80
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,949
when questions is why hackett and a
problem I'm sure this audience would

81
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,419
have no problem with that no hud's there
that's good enough reason

82
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,690
I am but I the blast them and the the
first one obviously this is cheaper

83
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,069
pictures

84
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,410
from dis you got a camera you'd like to
read from you submit

85
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,139
no one is a using nature's places
there's a lot of people and feedback

86
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:01,660
from

87
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,849
have by these cameras and given them to
preschoolers

88
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:08,440
kids through easily destroy him

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,500
dangerous places and another reason is
is that camcorder

90
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,280
version that they sell is the latest
camera and martin ever seen its

91
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,310
I think it's 21 grams the way to the
soul

92
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,669
it's a just a tiny tiny thing into PC
board in the lenses

93
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,049
super tiny just nothin on the way

94
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:32,810
and she can put in place is we like
what's important and I'm

95
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,550
governor example that come in on a
course you can always make you do new

96
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,190
things

97
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,300
and i cant im in this examples come up
later to you things that

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,919
it was never meant meant to do not just

99
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,008
from being hacked but it was originally
Camry me to do other things other than

100
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:54,160
being a camera

101
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,129
soon and then course because reason is
that they said you can be connected to

102
00:06:58,129 --> 00:06:59,250
Anna

103
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,860
computers there

104
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,330
so it starred hmm

105
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:09,840
the first the first before even
disassembled and the first thing I don't

106
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,520
miss the buttons

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,580
the free three finger salute as well we
kinda named its

108
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,878
he holding the record button

109
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,060
and the delete button while turning it
on and when you do that it will come up

110
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,710
in a special mode

111
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,389
animal tell you more information about
its Norman Lindsay

112
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:31,979
it's the firmware version the serial
number the camera and

113
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,360
for some reasons get the revision on the
PC board which

114
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,819
okay FindMe I guess is some reasons and
from where they don't work and certain

115
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:41,259
versions appease the word

116
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,440
we r Memory you know what the
differences are

117
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,389
my so opening the cover is pretty
straightforward

118
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:53,889
Hannah cleverly hidden underneath the
big sticker on the back or four screws

119
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:57,580
and just a normal screwdriver little
prying

120
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:01,969
and underneath you see the main PC born
on this the screen in the middle area

121
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,650
LCD screen and the buttons are this for
many things down

122
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,780
down bonham and is a micro phone

123
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,180
on the other side and demand as a
speaker for playback revere

124
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:18,990
your videos

125
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,220
and soon see up at the top here

126
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,030
we've got the special secret connector
that that is a really cheap connector

127
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:29,020
it's not me to be used that often

128
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,380
um its built into the PC board so casa
nothing to make

129
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,909
comcast is in their readers just
minimizes costs for them

130
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,390
their lands and sensors on another
little bored connects it will connect on

131
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,470
the back

132
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,110
fairly standard is the main processor to
the

133
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:53,470
and BJ packages from its processor

134
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,140
you can tell because it's the big
package on a and then toward

135
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,640
and we've got some graphic SDRAM memory
which is special table messy remembering

136
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,270
and its it's got some extra mode so that
its use

137
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:11,470
better for streaming you can look at
that part number:

138
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,170
scene with the memory chip down here to
try to reach him 128 megabytes

139
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:23,170
pretty standard

140
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,490
and

141
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,600
season and Seeger 10 pin connectors up
there at the top some

142
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,890
arena which each pen does is 10 pins are
only wilder's

143
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,460
supposed to be secret soon it sounds
kinda like a

144
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,500
for stumbling block on min is a couple
tricks to the trade

145
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,450
the I'm went trick users and

146
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,880
for determining which means the ground
pin you see the medal around the antenna

147
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,689
the edge on the boards all goal there

148
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,940
on that's easy navigation ground
ministers

149
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,330
if it connects to a screw home that's
even better indication ground

150
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:07,440
am separate there's

151
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,440
ground

152
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:18,430
and then %uh so we can use a multimeter
time to be this fancy

153
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,570
to going test to see which pins actually
physically connect to them because they

154
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,820
can connect through the morn

155
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,250
to the back side so in to identify going
to configure

156
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,740
Grampians and same with the parents you
you have chips

157
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,970
you've identified in documentation
labels which pins are

158
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,750
and you can connected Stephen buzzes and
monument arkin

159
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,370
there's another way to

160
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm just by looking at the connector the
see if something happens three this

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,580
means they're taller than the others

162
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,360
that's an indication that it's a power
ground from

163
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,000
when the connectors connect is in the
first part first pins to touch the

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,110
the connector when for scans to meet and

165
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,390
that's easy to understand back I'm the
ground to connect in that way you don't

166
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,069
get a Hi

167
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,070
voltage spandex bike and the D line to
protect some

168
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:15,070
and see their

169
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,089
another indication is that there's extra
metal on those pains and PC board

170
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:24,770
designers think that there's gonna be
tons a current

171
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,149
in truth it's all over kill you could
get away with the finished piece a wire

172
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:33,089
its Laguna to spin

173
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,649
for this and you're right is gonna

174
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:40,730
home in two minutes left and right in
and mistresses know you're on the side

175
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,750
to the connector they continue through
the more you can

176
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,010
you can't reset his lol so

177
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:53,740
sorry to recommend and so on

178
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,700
years there is little holes that you see
drilled in the middle

179
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,910
I'm kinda by the c40 over there to
slightly to the right

180
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,719
for and from the right those beers are
holes ago and connect through to you

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,870
inner layers and PC border the other
side and PC border

182
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,670
holes drilled in their pleaded with
copper and if you see a lot of those on

183
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:14,920
a

184
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,040
and you see there's only one 1 per wire
but if you see a line

185
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,149
its is designed to carry more current
still overkill but

186
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:26,740
people do it said you can do you know
what it is Mindy depends a little

187
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,560
trickier

188
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,930
around the country like you in a scam
and I'm

189
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,699
taken a class to their their little
further down I'm there often

190
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,329
senate races and I you can see it on
this board but there's two years

191
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,540
at the bottom and wearing on the back
side is just then are it's just norm

192
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,599
with and then often the Derek Anderson
metric will either be in pairs

193
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,709
or if it's a bust you see a more rounded
in a in a

194
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,550
come about lanes to its just a visual
clue

195
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,640
is the V is

196
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,449
an ass talking about and you can see at
home connectors

197
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:09,920
totally symmetric just and then I

198
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,279
and since this is the third generation
the camera league and I'm

199
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,600
someone use pens in these pens used to
be used on previous generations a camera

200
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,870
but

201
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,800
if you look carefully to see they don't
go anywhere they just dis there

202
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,500
and I'm

203
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,410
sOooo actually I didn't do the reverse
engineering this connector

204
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,899
an ass on Austin before I got started
the project but they guessed the USB

205
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:35,690
connection

206
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,010
and it makes sense it's a popular your
face its

207
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:43,459
supported by tons a consumer electronics
right changes I mean it's already in

208
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:43,959
there

209
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,980
am if they were to change it cost them
money and I'll pointless

210
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,180
scammers to be cheap and this is also
just for people cue track

211
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,240
this is the lamest slide in the whole
presentation said any of the report said

212
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,370
congestion Syria USB connector has 4
pins

213
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:09,029
um grounder 502 priceless when you plug
in your keyboard that's world powers

214
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:09,689
coming from

215
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm and then a day to Pasadena minus its

216
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,980
its complicated but there the RAM

217
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,220
a different align their they were gonna
pair and as you can see here

218
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,579
the ground in the power pins that stick
and from there

219
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:29,040
simply connect first that the they don't
cause damage with USD

220
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,260
same principle as on a secret connector

221
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:35,500
so the final another week to get out

222
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,630
know is that is a couple grounds on Dana
Plasse data minus

223
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,720
you can wired up and if you get a
backwards

224
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,959
and you try and hook it up to Windows
machine it'll say there's a

225
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,079
communication error

226
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,540
doesn't do any damage just says
communication error you can change it

227
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,420
back in

228
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,500
you know you had backwards and now you
get the right answer

229
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,530
I'm and then there's a yeah

230
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:00,150
better connection with trees with
multimeter back to the battery

231
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:05,120
now where they can check list and the
battery um I think they'd be able to

232
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,010
recharge a battery some people have done
that

233
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,020
but the basically checking to make sure
it's a good battery

234
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:17,020
that before the respect recycling beacon
replacing if any to its gonna die

235
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,740
so we got the cable its attack train its

236
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,439
doesn't sound too complicated an well as
recognized by the computer but

237
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,680
there's still needs drivers and this is
all my computer senator said

238
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,920
Saturn which is our code name for them
for the whole camera

239
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,490
the camcorder I'm when the hacks one
easier hacks

240
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,220
was that you could go through in find
unknown driver

241
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,390
by doing research on the chips inside
the camera from

242
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:50,470
and see if you can take unknown driver
change the vendor ID and the product id:

243
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,130
that it has

244
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,040
and two that number that the camera
gives you and then that driver should

245
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,270
automatically work with

246
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,390
the back camera and in case this case we
tried that

247
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,850
10 workers like a mechanism that
prevents working with normal drivers

248
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,910
so we're back to square one hmm not
quite

249
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:15,959
there's we have to do another level of
analysis

250
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,130
and so we can go back to hardware and

251
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:23,089
if you notice is large ships and 12
points so this whole project was for

252
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:23,689
further

253
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:28,890
pure digital mean factors was to
minimize the costs and using

254
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,390
there's so many components on this you
wonder how can be so cheap

255
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,449
um thirty dollars

256
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:39,209
the key is is that use chip on there is
produced through the different

257
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:40,000
technology

258
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,069
there's some glass chips memory chips
processor chips

259
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:48,750
there are also dense that the tweet the
prime minister in the making tips

260
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,670
so that the to work the best for that
type of thing

261
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,689
so for flash memory ex-governor and
bread

262
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:58,900
have have transistors and stuff

263
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,220
and they optimize its her works with
agreed to be really lousy

264
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,959
received that you're trying to to make
was not agree

265
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,470
too thanks to cheaper to make different
ships in different packages

266
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,939
different I that helps us a whole lot
because the

267
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,230
as you can see the managers have hard
numbers on them and they're also

268
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,599
ourselves that came in manufacture
because they've got

269
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,809
takin am by 10 ball

270
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,370
been on the market with the other other
and Richard manufactures

271
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:39,370
I'm

272
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,139
so if you go to the to the web sites and
look at these parts we get ahold issue

273
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,930
tells us everything about everything you
could possibly want to buy the chip

274
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,820
there's tons a user's in these chips and
they need to know this information so

275
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,419
it's all out there and there's a
standards organization that has the same

276
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:58,970
stuff

277
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:04,270
so they're all interoperable some best
document and partner whole camera

278
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,120
I'm

279
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,100
but then when you get to the processor
its kinda secretive

280
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,910
on the nines discover this is a

281
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,250
company comes around and I think it's
San Diego um

282
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:23,460
and they make processors chips for a
whole buncha cameras

283
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,270
to sold under it under different brand
names Fiji went to them

284
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,490
and they're very high volume by
interestingly enough and very few

285
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:34,260
customers

286
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,690
and those customers are the people who
make the cameras so

287
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,110
the prefer to deal with those people
only um

288
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,600
new thing is that this camera has
harvest

289
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,820
the microprocessor pirated software and
they're very tightly

290
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,760
interleaved whose functions you can do
in a processor torrents of rain and

291
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,120
they've

292
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,880
partitioned that nixon how and where
things get done

293
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,920
sir suffers an end integral component

294
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,710
and the apparent protective it event

295
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,380
so they've got em non-disclosure
agreements

296
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,200
dan Aykroyd normal people really get
into the south for

297
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,450
or the sheets on

298
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:19,040
so translation is we're bound

299
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,770
it's gonna be hard still an ombre

300
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,060
jury on you get the flash memory chips
and if you look at the five ish

301
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,620
memory data sheet its easy the pen
outages you in every single one is 48

302
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,580
pins does on the Internet and I'm

303
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,090
package and I'm if you look closely you
can see perhaps

304
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,480
hermano connects on that helps us with
soldering

305
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,390
we don't have to sign on those its it's
such a big

306
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,370
ship that they have to put in a big
package even doesn't have a lot of wires

307
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,070
going to it

308
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:57,510
I'm to be gone within the issue tells us
which pins and their

309
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,570
tells us what the exact order is

310
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,460
a farm that we have to go in and

311
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,650
which means to give it so whilst on left
their room give

312
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:12,310
wrong lower the anime to been able to
talent we want to start talking to in

313
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,600
time on the rapes give it a command to
you I'm

314
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,720
start reading given address we want to
read you can our data back

315
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,190
and I'm you could do that actually with
wires and lights

316
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,440
you be very painful burden it's possible

317
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,500
and I'm but much better ways either

318
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,850
you were gonna company who has won his
readers which I don't

319
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,620
how are you build your own and it's not
that difficult to build your own

320
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,990
from this is a product that I I got a
while ago

321
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,090
it's really handy Iverson's apparel for
dispute on computers

322
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:48,760
it's a USB i/o and basically gives you
twenty four pins to play with

323
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,050
under computer control you can seven
high some low you can read 'em

324
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:00,050
you can you can talk to all sorts of
things with this senator then

325
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,000
mean boy diana is in the background
there and again and after board and

326
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,310
middleware in harness to connect the two

327
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,030
and Sun do something a tip from became
for turns 100 on top there

328
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,870
and the reader program is fairly simple

329
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,810
on the instructions for the more tell
you had on

330
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,690
raising over the pens and basically I
just go through

331
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,390
each command goes through

332
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,500
corresponds to something on the day she
so

333
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,770
Deshawn issued as a guide and cause I
got myself from the web to use if

334
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,300
anyone's

335
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:45,070
months twenty thats free sample and some
other and other interfaces that

336
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,840
that people have used is Smart Media
Interface turns out that shipp I'm just

337
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,600
for reasons and I'm margin is nation

338
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,330
just make it compatible so they have
fewer

339
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,830
fewer versions have flash high-density
flash memory chips out there

340
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,520
its the same exact electrical interface

341
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,970
as SmartMedia card even act is obviously
really different am so people forget how

342
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,820
to wearing

343
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,659
correspondences between those two and
they've gotten adjusted generic

344
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,350
um smart media reader for mayor
Jacqueline

345
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:27,350
and rewired and been able to read all
the data in the chip so once we do that

346
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,030
we can 128 megabytes just numbers

347
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:35,710
SanDisk I'm intimidating into them look
at it sisters huge data found:

348
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,200
there's no like new way to end it

349
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,500
and I'm so the first thing to do is just
to start searching fringe

350
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,800
interesting stuff and I found

351
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,500
YLF which people may recognizes it as
I'm

352
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,240
as I execute a format which is kinda
interesting that's

353
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,500
nice that's a good signal and also in
fact 12

354
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
we found in their Anna

355
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,890
fat16 I'm went to stuff

356
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,220
so a summers markers the fat 12x16

357
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:16,900
Elfi yet where they were in memory and
likely free to those formats the town

358
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,230
the factor that your life is at the
beginning in the file

359
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,520
and secondly I listened to be up 2 p.m.

360
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,490
go home every so we know which area
memories use for

361
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,260
for what purpose and it's like pretty
much like her drug use is partitioned

362
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,670
and there's a special aryan beginning
it's a former

363
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,050
I'm and since it's just like I drive-ins
partitioned you can go in

364
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,260
in use dd which is that Unix file

365
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,450
UNIX programming growing split up these
to file in sections

366
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,680
and get ISO files and

367
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,110
just man I'm on a Mac are clinics or
whenever

368
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:02,110
on any guesses what's in that big no
name section there

369
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,390
your video files said

370
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:11,050
said that was a very painful hack and
had to take off the membership

371
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,730
but in a solo artist in figure out if
AVI files

372
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:20,510
were standard AVI files om no encryption
and just plain old sitting there

373
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,290
exactly like generator digital camcorder

374
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,600
answers come approve a concept but it's
still a good hack because it's

375
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,840
dance just painful but lower in there we
can go in

376
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,699
and start exploring the other sections a
memory and their projections

377
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,120
and I'm is a bunch resource ponerse

378
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,960
there and they have different things
like only video images that are used a

379
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,370
different processes

380
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,840
in the operation a camera turning on
turning off

381
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,189
different messages that they just
included as as bitmaps

382
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:57,640
and we also found some production line
test software

383
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,670
in there which is kinda interesting
weeks I had no idea how it's

384
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,760
how if there's a special key sequence to
use to bring it up but it's

385
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,750
is in there so to memos and I mean you
have to convince the Act later if

386
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,920
anyone's interested in

387
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,270
and they get the culture and they can
air

388
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,050
a greater which complicated

389
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,889
it's obviously use for some coloration
um interesting the

390
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,060
if you zoom in this the Macbeth color
Turner

391
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,080
and I'm happy rated and I'm sure they've

392
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,610
paid for that license but am

393
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,270
and I'll so if you notice when we
brought up to with the three finger

394
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,870
salute

395
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,670
it to bring a VM India

396
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,950
from a version in the serial number you
can look like ms comics

397
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,520
that front and ham

398
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,730
said to there's a found the incoming
tide been in there

399
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,370
and moon see that's the real thing if
you look at the beginning it says Comic

400
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,480
Sans MS which is a pretty good
indication and its

401
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,280
derivative Microsoft version on

402
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,139
interestingly makers iverson a doesn't
allow you to use in commercial products

403
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,480
or or modified format from the two-time

404
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,310
soon I'm sure their lesson that to you

405
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:22,560
and and then also there's another file
in here on

406
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,600
Carlstadt file and this is kinda

407
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,150
feature that didn't surprise me and
every video this report every time you

408
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,840
turn on/off power

409
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,900
it records that in this file so there's
a date and time

410
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,080
reeling frames per second and number
bites the fire

411
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,909
a mystery number 22

412
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,630
and I'm and soon the Dane time there's
no clock

413
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,790
this you just by using you can tell it
is clock in there but

414
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:54,260
mine and my cock was that correctly for
some time zone

415
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,410
and just kinda hidden feature

416
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:03,620
on that's George Orwell

417
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,680
and as a bunch of other files to they've
got and

418
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,070
one resource want one partition that
they use for other customization

419
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,720
arm individual customization so it's got
the serial number the camera

420
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,660
his camera has a custom unlock code and
there's also a default

421
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,870
unlock code and house as a promise like
the recording resolution and a time

422
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:26,460
limit

423
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:29,760
there's a 20 minute time limit even if
you

424
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,250
recorder video that's a really low bit
rate because it's just a

425
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,090
just a while it's not moving on bill
still timing out in 20 minutes 25

426
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,830
minutes or so

427
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,389
you know the memories for

428
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,330
and select believes that first partition
that their firmer

429
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:49,409
some which is the most fun for me I'm

430
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:53,130
my specialties is in bed and engineering
side deal with the Senate

431
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,430
professionally a lot but I L some dealt
with in high school and college so it's

432
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,750
it's not that

433
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,030
complicated cease excellent intelligence

434
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,610
on to the three cameras are all very
different

435
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,700
am the first one the simplest one would
have to display

436
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,810
60 Kb ive cone I'm the one with the is
still camera with the display

437
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,810
124 and in the camcorder just

438
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,909
closed out massively its it's not 1.2
mags

439
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,130
from it has do more it also has the

440
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,280
and hang for compression an intake for
playback in there so it's

441
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,410
its is doing more the other ones do more
stuff in our worsened

442
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,110
doesn't have to do not suffer

443
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,320
so you can start looking through the air
that found a former

444
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,399
crown and strings is a popular UNIX
utility

445
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,240
and you could find a hundred John on

446
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,670
but if you keep a look into it there's
some interesting stuff in there

447
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:53,930
and effective pixels is apparently
they're doing some mapping if defective

448
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,250
pixels

449
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:58,280
masking those houses County lone bright
spot every time you

450
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,200
or something I'm and other stuff in
there

451
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,280
and some other stuff is some very useful
stuff

452
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,940
some even though the and Zoran chipset
and the data Anna

453
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,630
website didn't say too much about what
was actually work and processor was in

454
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,790
there to send it was a blah blah blah

455
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,950
and we can find out how

456
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,910
the designers this is some text left
over from the compiler

457
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,260
and tells exactly what's

458
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,260
bylines and the operating system and
nasa says it

459
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,090
in is the LX 4180 which is a MIPS
processor

460
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:39,210
you look up that and it's I'm sleepy was
good enough for the compiler does seem

461
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,060
that this or interpret

462
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,050
Alex 4180 then is good enough for us to
decompile

463
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,980
an arm 3 X's the embedded operating
system in there

464
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,530
and then greenhouse makes our own eyler

465
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:55,600
or the use you see something like that

466
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,610
but much variation their

467
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,630
term strings also gives us more
information

468
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:05,930
um you are a minor you aren't as a fancy
name for serial port

469
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,810
and even though we don't see 0:14 in
even test not the secret

470
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:14,200
10-pin connector think it's on the chip
is just not connected in a way that we

471
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,680
can connect to Toby

472
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,010
underneath the chip on a pin that we can
get to

473
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,379
from becoming gives a hint that there's
some secret even features and then it's

474
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:28,130
successful somewhere

475
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,070
and then %uh some just a little part I
have no idea how to use this but they

476
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,860
had these things in there

477
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,970
um tells us the model number the sensor

478
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,390
and the model number the LCD but those
are kind information is hard to get

479
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:48,190
sensor was a mark because it was unclear
package and the LCD was just

480
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,130
because the taiwanese manufactured in
have good documentation

481
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,300
on so just strings very simple utility
we can get

482
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,680
lunch and dinner pretty easily

483
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,810
and then and this is a very much
technical audience but I have a a quick

484
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,340
overview how programs are made in this
is

485
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:12,480
this is essential to figure how to take
that wrong

486
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,140
data converted back into something
that's meaningful

487
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,280
town

488
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:25,080
sue we start off with the mister miss
the stuff is written in C

489
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,560
and I'm from Bennett systems

490
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,679
here's an example code than average is
up 0.2 numbers

491
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:37,080
and that's run through a compiler gives
us the same language in that looks

492
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,710
something like this:

493
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,700
and you can call it home maybe if you
look at it and follow it closely you

494
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,500
could tell it was an averaging algorithm

495
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,750
you can see there's some addition in
there there's a loop

496
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,790
meant the end it's divided by 10 sue

497
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,080
doesn't indication but it's not obvious

498
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,889
and then afterwards in the same language
isn't who in object file:

499
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,910
which takes the functions and and just
kind of

500
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,090
says that they're here shares in the
primaries the treatment the user I'm but

501
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,970
doesn't give

502
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,010
insists reduce the raw numbers and I'm

503
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,280
so it's less information and finally

504
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,040
then information stripped-down and we
get into the object found

505
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,460
this case it's a stripped Elfi which
means that they too can on the afternoon

506
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,430
at the strings that are

507
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,860
use when debugging just makes it smaller

508
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,640
an arm and that's how we get the the
ride in a refined

509
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,140
in the in a flash memory chip

510
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,030
to to do some laundry do reverse process
was charred

511
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:48,389
I'm I just picked these bites truly
random

512
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,440
the air there's three had am sorry for
expats makes a bit 32 bit word from its

513
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,760
instruction said

514
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,370
and with an instruction set and be
converted to binary

515
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:04,160
and then a.m. look it up in there in
their book

516
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,170
it tells you exactly how that with an
instruction does

517
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,500
from the binaries use because different
fields 10

518
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,510
indicate which instruction is being done

519
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:17,390
diamonds are different values like the
media data value over there

520
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:21,110
and and and the page in the mix manual
is very descriptive it tells you

521
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,860
everything

522
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,420
its even if and this is a big step to

523
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,970
to learn a family but once you learn
when a similar language the other ones

524
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:33,280
are come easier easier it's

525
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,710
still a challenge but to stagnation is
so good

526
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,790
to for the MEPS on and in most other
things that the

527
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:45,720
you get to it eventually it's just its
kinda slow

528
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,730
and I'm so that's one instruction and
there's

529
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:52,570
300,000 more instructions like that and
the camera

530
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,310
and so we can automate the process on

531
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,139
there's a number to december's that you
can use

532
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,070
time there's a free one from from canoe
and color BJ tools

533
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:08,639
it's a default installation on on 101 X

534
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,980
and the next machines mine access our

535
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,270
seasons meant to be Deanna

536
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,239
and then that there's also a commercial
when this year's line and virus analysis

537
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,820
um commercial when I have never used

538
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,720
it's apparently really good its 452

539
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,850
829 dollars depending on when options to
you reactions again

540
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,060
and then support is ten thousand dollars
a year which is kinda my

541
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:40,179
budget for this project

542
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,980
and then there's a third option on you
can always reach around and that sounds

543
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,929
pretty mint intimidating

544
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:49,949
bread the december's just a translator

545
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:53,189
takes for mites because at some taxed

546
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,659
its its not as complicated as Lana

547
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:59,819
the program's it could be written in the
weekend

548
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,380
um it's just a basic input/output is not

549
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,030
man a lot of sophistication to in

550
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,710
an arm you cannot sue base year you're
just summer

551
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:16,400
others peoples two summers I'm I did
that for all my projects

552
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,930
and the cool thing is by reading
earnings which you can support any

553
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,029
processor

554
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,060
and the and digital camera with the
viewfinder

555
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,980
used the custom processor that had never
been documented

556
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,080
I'm not sure someone that by there

557
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,140
as a result or notices Somersworth so

558
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:38,470
run my own helped out I mean it's the
only way to do it

559
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,870
time and then the last thing is you can
make the two summers marred as you need

560
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,009
it to be

561
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,940
and if you go in you find a situation
where you're looking at

562
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,540
some coding and you wanna

563
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,990
making I magnin comment you can add a
comment over and making

564
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,530
do some thinking for you weren't
competitive

565
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,550
so you can example here on

566
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,450
his initial output from from reach a
dump

567
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:09,250
and it's just axe numbers stuff

568
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:14,820
on wanna things added onto it was there

569
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,480
this to later 32-bit number in to
register it takes to instructions and

570
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,780
1 sectional attack 60 minutes the other
one moves the other 16 bits

571
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:28,240
Anna its kinda fun and intuitive when
you look at it you got negative 318

572
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,870
12 what's that mean so I'm I mean the

573
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,069
December kinda prepares to instructions
together

574
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,490
and figure would address it was

575
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,570
does the math the instructions that
that's taking place in the Anderson

576
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:47,270
that this transactions loan is that
Ghanem you know 11

577
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,759
the three BC so you can put that in

578
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,950
I'm rains come in at best color for this
slide here

579
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,580
Miller I'm in

580
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:03,120
so we've got more information that
wasn't there

581
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,660
nurse have on to that is an honor

582
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,980
we don't know the number means assists
just there

583
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,130
and we can actually look up in memory
where that

584
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,080
pieces in and in this case we are lucky
who supported flash memory which we had

585
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,490
Rd taken out

586
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,960
and you can see that points to the
string in Cincy style string

587
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,460
brands are terminating at the end use
his camera ID

588
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,440
and so we can make that this is summer
smarter again have it automatically

589
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,210
indicate when it finds a number whether
it's it points sums

590
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,570
interesting string some to swim into
some burnout

591
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,880
December now does so you camera ID
whenever

592
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,330
something season it very much and

593
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,900
can I think we're we're did we see that
before and that was in there

594
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,850
that three finger salute said right now
we know the tax code

595
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:59,220
is using is being used to generate

596
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,700
just the sampling so that's pretty
powerful it was just a bunch numbers

597
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:07,580
now we've got we can actually know when
it's been calm when it does

598
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:12,529
min that's in a specific example I can
cherry-pick sprint

599
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,540
hits on a you start with and you can
build and finding out where

600
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,550
Kong's on

601
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,660
see yeah and since been addressed extra
screen we can put a comma in there that

602
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,660
says drought extra screen

603
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,390
for that server team that the cars and
make the disassembler

604
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,950
I'm actually whenever anyone calls every
team

605
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:41,160
protect comment on track to screens we
can find other things to try text screen

606
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,440
sits on an incremental process sounds
billings assembler student's murder

607
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,060
so and ought to do the work exists we
too much could look at

608
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,430
nominee you can get lucky and I'm

609
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,520
I found some strings and into the really
interesting that looked like path names

610
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,700
and cameras you cam agents comment on

611
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:05,660
man and I am bizarre uses prime news

612
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,210
and typically this is used in SNA debug
Preminger

613
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,609
um in this case the functionality if it
were to fail

614
00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:17,240
it would pronounce this debug message on
some debug console and we now have

615
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,359
access to

616
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,029
and retain their my number 72 a function

617
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:26,480
on command at sea had a failure and that
when a person to go back to source code

618
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,770
recent figure

619
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:31,060
but the problem is and fix it around but
they left the seine

620
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,170
and it since it's kinda built in the
library snot

621
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:38,790
is easy for them to remove and a big
government is just coming over Cyprus

622
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:41,980
lucky for us and

623
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,880
so we can all urs path names we can find
out that the farmers may not from over

624
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,440
200 files

625
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,160
which is coming we've got some insight
into their am

626
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,609
how they build their home program and
actually I got on this from

627
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:59,910
strings I just did a search and see
colon slash

628
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:05,350
def and got this list

629
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,710
serrano ham more importantly then I'm

630
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:15,710
that ties some code to a file which
kinda gives an idea what it's doing

631
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,500
suiting & announces to another level on

632
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,850
use this online and since is using
operating system that we found out I'm

633
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:30,660
screws resign and miss with strings arm

634
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:34,509
dealers operating system objects like
IQ's

635
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:39,280
memory buffers also system things like
that and some animal able to taxed

636
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,990
and example this function here term use
bhi kam kam and

637
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:47,300
arm is a primary calling a function

638
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,310
and

639
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,259
we look up in a in a thread X manual you
can see the

640
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,210
described in great detail again on the
name command

641
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,660
me bring it back down to name in command

642
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,009
and where are the other parameters are
so

643
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:10,980
move friends you can you can see you
spycam command is now associated with

644
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,370
with that very much you know 14 3 sb
foreign to top

645
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:20,390
so whenever we use and very rare we can
precum and again

646
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,779
I'm angry with the disassembler that
we're using that Q

647
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,600
and I'm senator turns out there's a
lotta system objects

648
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:35,100
hmm appearance similar name to very
obviously switch can tell what they are

649
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:38,609
and these not so much but there's a 7

650
00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:42,020
system-level threads just different
things we can do

651
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,880
row server which I assume is for looking
at pictures

652
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,820
agents around because USB monitor could
be a secret debug command

653
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,330
and their 11 timorese so too when you
press a button

654
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:59,990
there's probably time and they receive
you hold it down for more than three

655
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,640
seconds

656
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,670
more different different things the a
timer heavy

657
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,000
just frame rates

658
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,420
and there's 22 new taxes

659
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,940
and and these are things that and you
can see one who's FCU mute X in a

660
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,180
society that these room you taxes

661
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,370
milk on the same function with this text

662
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,549
and I

663
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,859
then be on that there were 34 cues

664
00:42:26,859 --> 00:42:31,220
still lots more information from empty
frames

665
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,550
free buffer for display all sorts of
stuff

666
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,089
can not only is a Justin just to CNN's
bill but again it's tied back to

667
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,690
pieces and software so we can see when
is it going

668
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,350
the new era in 64 transient threads its

669
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:51,040
just keeps getting bigger and bigger
Annan

670
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,220
different things like cattle Annies
earner features a turn a balloon this

671
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,810
camera like there's an open lands in
there somewhere

672
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,660
and zoom command center use a zoom in

673
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,640
turned murder on wait a little bit I'm
turning off

674
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,370
and then lastly there were 180 monitor
commands

675
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,850
which if anyone remembers it will happen
to you could have been things

676
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:17,290
going to toss prompt very low level

677
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,430
its common one invented operating
systems and the cool thing about this is

678
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:21,960
that

679
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,839
not only release commands in there and
they had their parameters and they also

680
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,810
had helped

681
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:30,660
parson person and described when he's
commanded

682
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:35,460
said Oh this 102 command 180 places in
this offer where we know when it's going

683
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,640
to you

684
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,440
sends he's a lot and information to help
us out

685
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,570
and some again going back to December

686
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,190
improving in we can go through and Anna

687
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,680
figure the released these I'm

688
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,100
threads and and monitor commands have
entry point so we know we really

689
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:01,420
really start you can actually add that
into the air

690
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,100
december's that'll keep track of if one
function calls in the function calls on

691
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:06,890
the function

692
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:10,870
you know that that function that third
function is used by the first function

693
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:15,220
so cue track and that in this is Anna
function

694
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:19,910
um you can see it's called by the server
command the motor should earn the murder

695
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:20,980
iris

696
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,470
zoo murder LED blink focused I'm

697
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:27,900
its a so-called I am GPIO sent

698
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,230
which is general purpose i/o and so this
is probably a low-level function that

699
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,960
goes through

700
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,850
and hmm set some bits controls and
physical outputs

701
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,620
the to the outside world so that's just
through the

702
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,870
seeing who calls and we can figure out
when it does without even looking at the

703
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:47,440
current

704
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,609
so there's latter work many months on

705
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:57,390
its and for me it's kinda relaxing and
goes through I can take a timeout

706
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,859
happens in the former

707
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:03,150
and take it to a coffee shop this work
on it is kinda crossword puzzle

708
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:08,390
hum two-year live something works

709
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:12,660
put on pieces together it's is just too
relaxing hobby for me

710
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,960
and CBS camera I'm

711
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,370
eventually after doing enough you get
pieces the code

712
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:23,240
start fit together and I found a USB cam
command

713
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,109
cue also a USB agent asking and

714
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:30,680
from the sea and the command

715
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,460
dispatcher task an archive two-piece
despair

716
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,890
Alma elements and I put together in a
mom love how I thought the camera worked

717
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:40,120
internally

718
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,560
and my initial idea was it to the USB
comes in

719
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:49,560
talks to the USB agen which puts a
command in a you speak and command Q

720
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,730
which goes to the came and dispatcher
which goes into his own

721
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,200
demands that it needs to and then calls
the

722
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,510
very slow mcmahon's in order

723
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:02,960
annum sued

724
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,870
did sup really can picture printed
didn't help me didn't work

725
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:10,980
on there something that was preventing
me from ran the drivers from

726
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,760
tartan mcmahon's to go get your pictures
out soon obviously there's a fly on

727
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,060
that mountain air on

728
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,390
and then CBS camcorder actually came
together pretty quickly

729
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,470
and going slow for months and then a
within a couple days

730
00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:30,819
I'm people were trying different
commands and they were just trying

731
00:46:30,819 --> 00:46:34,300
every single possible USB command on

732
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:38,770
better to go out and they found that one
command number EFI

733
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:43,240
and would sometimes return number and on
the other commands just didn't do

734
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,230
anything they just

735
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:48,370
didn't return anything just new feedback
but this one returned a number once

736
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:51,460
sOooo yeah

737
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:58,460
to an so at the same time I was looking
to Kona founders need peace a code

738
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,800
Tom it looks like this and is a

739
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,020
peace occurred because Syrian tax for a
number this past week

740
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,850
and sees if it's 15 numbers 929 the

741
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:11,990
FASB RFF Anna

742
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:15,430
scanners why would you check metastases
can assist

743
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:18,680
cysts that some specific numbers

744
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:23,089
and likely winners as the FE command we
had seem

745
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:27,870
so I can put that back in my mama and
the idea was that most the commands like

746
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,569
that word

747
00:47:28,569 --> 00:47:32,970
lot in tow something and I'm not
diminished one command

748
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,460
for a couple commands it would go served
on Larkin

749
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:40,609
so that's what happened um I followed
that program

750
00:47:40,609 --> 00:47:44,490
where was doing that comparison checked
out where the FAA and he and I have

751
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:48,660
commands were inferior how they worked

752
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,129
and here's how they work basically um

753
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,859
camera has he has a.m.

754
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:59,460
is a challenge response has a secret
password which is your challenge

755
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,480
1980 every camera

756
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,500
and then there's the response which
after you have to tell a camera to track

757
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,200
respond

758
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,270
make an unlock

759
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:16,780
so there's three functions that support
that arm

760
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:20,140
yen there's two for them for the
challenge wonder

761
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,509
when do time which number you want an
unknown number to give back

762
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,940
in the way it works is that you for see
you in a

763
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:31,980
at sea you ask you a challenge number
zero is

764
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,890
you get the and number back it's 1234
from the table a memory that exact

765
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:41,040
that's actually had a memory looks had
this to you

766
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,279
to you and the challenge response are
looking in memory

767
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,370
and I'm you send response 0

768
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:54,440
detail with the responses looks up in a
table sees it as four three two one that

769
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:54,940
you

770
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:58,980
you sent it matches it with the table
personal tech market

771
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,460
just this this response has been
answered correctly and tell you

772
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,660
back whether for all the responses have
been answered correctly were if you

773
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,330
still have more work to go

774
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:12,350
and so Am services my hackers know this

775
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,700
part it's asking the wrong question and
I'm

776
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,819
tuned hackney's asking the wrong
questions

777
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:22,850
so I asked her what was towns number
four

778
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:27,460
and as you can see the signs are a few
form but that was a

779
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:31,359
overflow hair that they had not heard

780
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:38,359
so we got back to the numbers are other
sponsors

781
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,000
can imagine workers from here

782
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,780
and I'm your three kids room

783
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,910
get off or an arm give it back to
numbers the same numbers I just gave you

784
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,520
and it's unlocked

785
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:04,520
fair

786
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:08,950
first there's more you

787
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,300
I am you silly Africa Africa to pictures
on a plan

788
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,990
getting the commands to get the pictures
on a camcorder on the entire work

789
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,410
some drivers we looked at for winners
/url NXP

790
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,649
so how this works and emulated in same
functionality

791
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,050
once we've been like a camera I'm you
might say that this is all wrong

792
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,190
too easy saw how many text message text

793
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:33,990
pieces a Hannah described persons with
the camera

794
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,060
and the question is what if you're not
so lucky send

795
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,089
can run it I'm here but cover Hannah

796
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:44,720
so good tuzla quicker and the second
camera

797
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,230
and didn't have a document processor new
document and OS

798
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:52,500
and no new three names tax to be like
you

799
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,890
so we did a little research from friend
at the company did

800
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,109
but the VA make a risk processor from
another company

801
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:03,259
and that's why I was soon so hard to
find how it worked

802
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:07,760
was that bad boy named captain turn lane
and in release documentation

803
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,250
likely the Wayback Machine had some one
page from

804
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,780
1992 or something like that on had one

805
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:19,339
still above information how it worked

806
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:22,600
and sector can skip to the zoo quicker
but

807
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,650
and first promises that the too much
code

808
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:31,180
for 64k processor and so I middle you to
leave it went through and look to

809
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,300
this is the actual code that I found in
that camera

810
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,520
and I conquered identify how often that
black had been seen

811
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:42,640
and so the you can see some purple stuff
and that's a free space in between the

812
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,200
blacks

813
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:48,089
the bank's memory limit switches in an
hour

814
00:51:48,089 --> 00:51:55,089
in seeking timely banks are about 10 I'm
and then looking at this area over here

815
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:59,450
you can see that same pattern at the
start of every bank

816
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:04,569
and that's the library routines that
town bank can initialize it's got the

817
00:52:04,569 --> 00:52:05,310
Mac

818
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,589
operations now we it's always a memory
visa

819
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:13,750
much between you stuff

820
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,620
I'm

821
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:21,460
so just using that graphic image we
forget how

822
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,560
had how the bank switching worked where
where they were

823
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,830
from and it brings wishing to
disassembler which was

824
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:31,089
fairly complicated in to put the market
the time

825
00:52:31,089 --> 00:52:34,089
and for you know how head and

826
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:38,029
do in I'm gonna stop

827
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:44,279
and mmm at sea

828
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:47,549
so we we from the and matters in their

829
00:52:47,549 --> 00:52:50,710
you how it works many months again and

830
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:54,560
him to start story is it was second
there is hacked

831
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,819
time again security analysis I can
probably give that in a

832
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:01,930
the anime that third track

833
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,880
presentation if anyone's interested arm
two main uses

834
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,080
that and this is a first thing announce
that so many people forget how the

835
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,589
corruption works in to the basin
corruption without using the tricks and

836
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:18,150
than I'm used and working on it

837
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,390
we're doing a brute force attack time
hopefully we'll find the key

838
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:26,589
for the new camera times in the CBS
cameras may be hacked again

839
00:53:26,589 --> 00:53:30,569
and that's really big Newsome extended

840
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,670
to that that I am sam Harris
