1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:03,860
yeah okay

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:07,740
%uh so this is it is fire

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:12,910
this is this gonna be really hands-on
for a second I'll

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:16,059
up to can you there was a

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,310
up fine for this here I gotta

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,650
pick it up is okay I'm watching it just
okay jeff has a vacuum pump in front of

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:26,920
him

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,360
so this vacuum pump I

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:39,360
you put out parts of your body

10
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:46,969
so

11
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:50,789
so just

12
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:57,789
sucks so

13
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:29,489
interest

14
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,680
it's basically

15
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,220
some rest

16
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:03,220
just

17
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,970
process the

18
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,400
suck

19
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:39,010
its

20
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:12,630
I was

21
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,670
lists

22
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:49,670
its

23
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:06,060
just text

24
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:32,209
sir

25
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:36,980
should

26
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:43,980
six

27
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:27,300
bucks for groceries

28
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,990
and we all get together cook a six seven
course meal it's always weird stuff

29
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,370
because we have a really weird catch up
with a centrifuge in the kitchen

30
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,500
the times we have liquid nitrogen I we
have all this really worth of me trying

31
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:36,870
to make

32
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,990
nasty stuff like were with me and it's
which

33
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:43,029
didn't work frankly actually we try to
make it work

34
00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:47,459
to sow it was not yet a but so we also
get together try mess with people's mess

35
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:48,279
with each other's a

36
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,939
aesthetics and so Allen are taking on
the road a for the past three weeks

37
00:15:51,939 --> 00:15:52,459
we've been

38
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:56,120
driving from San Francisco all over the
United States to cook with our friends

39
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,670
and family

40
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,750
we have a couple dinner parties here in
New York and they've been really

41
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,500
successful they were here and one other

42
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,699
at of now yeah you back there are some
cool I

43
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,629
and if it's really fun to get together
and a baby are expecting

44
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,329
to pack up a a lot of money I'm it's
really nice to have a seven course

45
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,029
gourmet meal for only 20 bucks

46
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:17,439
and see your friends make it and usually
make things people never done before so

47
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:17,779
thats

48
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,259
the gratuitous plug it was red t-shirts
to sell cigarettes the draft or whatever

49
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:24,279
but if if anyone's interested enough
hope yes book another

50
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,300
got cancer for next year or whatever let
us know if you have an awesome kitchen

51
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,100
and you can curate a party and get
together much people will definitely

52
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,879
come over and

53
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,670
across a few with you I guess now we get
to the zero-day heart goes back ever

54
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,610
since we met for

55
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,860
which is the new machines the techniques
keeping up a new trend so talk a bit

56
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,230
about

57
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,550
what some other restaurants are doing
out its a base for this trade secrets is

58
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,740
always a chemical industries and flavor
industries

59
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,130
and I they have if the kick down the old
wares to

60
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,250
a to the restaurant world I'm other
going to deco

61
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:58,000
how the desert as they want about some
yeah it's really weird

62
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,059
their talk good yeah it's the its beauty
except for the terrier

63
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,879
really left I'm so a so here's some

64
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,230
here so I doubt strains have tear gas
affidavits grow its

65
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,620
it's a comes from Dragon which is where
the workers from so have

66
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,789
so we have we have restaurants

67
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:20,819
that our competition this is this is why
hacking is a little bit different

68
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,449
I think that work in a restaurant right
person to work in a restaurant cuz I

69
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:24,699
don't wanna work 18 hours a day

70
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:27,709
and seven days a week like trying to
pump out a lot of the food I'd rather

71
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,720
sit around the front to make that since
and mess around with weird stuff like

72
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,760
rose water and

73
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,950
you know with this is a homemade honey
suckle sir

74
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:38,350
right now I want to explore talk about
some experiments were doing later

75
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,309
but right now I'm really in a circus
were making things like saffron syrup

76
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:44,428
and wormwood surf and turf Monte serving
percent on sirup in

77
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,809
every possible kind sir if you'd ever
want you and they're all pretty for

78
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:50,899
a so I have never have what a weird
stuff

79
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:54,100
so restaurants for competition for who
gets a new technique for summer comes up

80
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,140
with a new technique like a

81
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,690
we at this restaurant I called every 50
here in New York say when he's never for

82
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:01,760
yeah it's pretty fat some fifty quince
tree should check it out

83
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,200
they have fried many sq right if that
happens by half its breaded cuba

84
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,530
man is has been fried how do you get

85
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,549
they make it they make its a press
release how'd they do that right because

86
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,129
it has a native consistency

87
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,360
etiquette run all over the place right
has a stake you

88
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,110
so they make sense and gelling agents
will talk about a little bit that's

89
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,970
their zero-day

90
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,950
they own that first right then they
don't anyone else who does as ripping

91
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:25,610
them off

92
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,539
writes that the restaurants are all
about go places like hopefully where

93
00:18:28,539 --> 00:18:29,280
they had this thing called

94
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,320
assume it's like a cloud with used as
nitrous canister

95
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,770
to like foam out all kinds of weird
stuff stays inside really intricate

96
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,549
position

97
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,690
and people rip that off now what people
in New York in Chicago doing phones but

98
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,039
there to solve panama's

99
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:45,970
because there's no real intellectual
property in you can't copyright recipe

100
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,169
because it a recipe you got great
recipes I'm process

101
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:53,090
which kick operate a list of ingredients
and you tell me let's agree it's all

102
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:53,830
know how to make it

103
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,040
pretty much and so that there's a lot of
a by recipe swapping and

104
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,210
and of course there's the underground
network of course the people like me and

105
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,080
other people who go

106
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,530
to work at restaurants for free and do
the real work as if you're a really rich

107
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,110
restaurant for 20 bucks a person

108
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,460
you're still not making any money unless
you're free slave labor

109
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,540
doing all your work and so young people
or

110
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,928
I you know people as well yeah they're
often I

111
00:19:14,929 --> 00:19:18,850
several people a yeah I bet they go to
restaurants and work for free

112
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,590
and then they go to another restaurant
to go to restaurants every know once you

113
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,320
know for a month or three at a time and
then

114
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,889
true they trade although like calling
techniques and stuff like that so start

115
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:29,649
but some of those techniques is the
survey techniques the city

116
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:32,330
is sort of what we're doing here there's
a really good book on out there but it's

117
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:32,760
a

118
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,658
you this we use a ceiling your vacuum
sealer to put your meat or or vegetables

119
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,360
and whatever

120
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,790
and you basically boil it at but you
keeping at the right temperature

121
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,000
now anyone who ever had a TV dinner or
that like the back corner you get

122
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,350
you got a boil that's basically the same
thing that food is restart have I'm

123
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,799
you know fifty years ago whatever but at
restaurants what you to take a look for

124
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:55,668
local for cross for us to legal here for
now yet it's okay

125
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:59,740
far bezel is just right an investor is
the artist

126
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,870
ever I'm its it's wrong right Starcraft

127
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,780
except chickens morons because chickens
that the truth and even worse

128
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,850
but a so basically if you take a look
before I don't use your

129
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,750
Japan resolve its a masks it was a lot
of work with a lot of flavor to the pan

130
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,159
take off and get someone but if you put
in a vacuum sealed bag

131
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,799
it was any the liquid doesn't lose its
shape because its form if you hold it in

132
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,059
a water bath like a

133
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,320
a good chemistry water bath at state
sixty degrees Celsius

134
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,439
for 45 minutes it could sit perfectly
all the way through you could hold it

135
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,470
there for like

136
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,250
you know four hours five hours and it'll
still be at that right temperature

137
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,460
me take it out to taste delicious it is
really well coupled with her that's a

138
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,480
backing for kids

139
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,750
but of course it doesn't make the roast
flavors right because is not the

140
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,440
as I think brown on the outside so what
you do is when you take out about that

141
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,530
you have to see it with a blowtorch to
make those ross flavors

142
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:51,658
because people are counting on those
rustlers otherwise just a spoiled

143
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:55,510
but it is perfectly boiled right it is
real it but it's really well could offer

144
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,470
on some other techniques are a jerk
hardware nation which is this really

145
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,389
nice it's like a

146
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:03,120
10 a 10 little blades that you just
puncture into like a big steak or

147
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,780
something

148
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,090
and magically state case a crazy tender
and all the merit it gets into it

149
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,668
because it gets if you're doing on this
vacuum chamber

150
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,250
your opening up pathways to the inside
of me and it's it's pretty amazing how

151
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,330
well you can earn it something which is
the specs that knife contraption

152
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,500
on this is the nitrous oxide everyone
here enjoy nitrous

153
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,750
yeah I thought I saw a bunch of Elantra
turns out on the street you have thought

154
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,010
so

155
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,890
and so nitrous oxide is a is an amazing
thing because what you're doing

156
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:32,820
with the nitrous oxide siphon like your
house right there is a you are a rating

157
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,100
the you a rating the food that's
insights when you put cream in its a

158
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,980
whip cream charger

159
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,900
you put cream in it you're a rating the
cream like just like you would with but

160
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,290
with a whisk acceptor super a reading it
with really cold up

161
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:47,060
a nitrogen are out doctors oxide
actually so

162
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,530
that's what that does and so you can put
anything in that canister and foam it

163
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,790
out so what we've done is we've done a a

164
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,889
paper stocks euro bergamot phone

165
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,710
and what that is is we took this blender
here is to undermine our blender

166
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,150
that out that's got some water in it and
I

167
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:06,530
with weaver up preventive

168
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,450
first Osseo Senate given for this and we
blended it to 10 miles an hour

169
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:16,750
and we've added some substances to it to
make it to is the first asi es

170
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,200
other guys gone from

171
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,470
for you can open up the phone inside it

172
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,540
but Richard McDonald quota

173
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,050
so if you do is you think this blunder
top because her mouth paragraph

174
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:39,010
water in it finalists meaning of up

175
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:42,020
call me some work her ok

176
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:48,940
all could %uh cap

177
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:55,940
you

178
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:06,330
I guess let's go two miles an hour we
have this is how the central while

179
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:13,168
find out this is up for d'amato the 100
for tomatoes in her for two months your

180
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:14,159
Earl Grey tea

181
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,370
that's what says that's what it is is
this a small little citrus flavor

182
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,899
yeah that's my bike this is Lamar 17
only water

183
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,370
as other moderator so the more water

184
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,549
what's good for a couple drops to the
summer others bergamot essential oil on

185
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:29,970
their

186
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,070
and then we want this so we want this to
be so would be like cream

187
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,350
in that in that siphon but how's it
gonna be like cream any ideas

188
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,510
suggestions the audience what what
magical substance hits on this table

189
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:45,360
lecithin

190
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,460
soya lecithin anyone it was it so it's
what's inside a eggs

191
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,649
thought since I take your texts with 60
drops

192
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:56,020
the stuff and then a little bit sore
left then

193
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,418
was up objects and cuz if this nasty
sticky stuff gets on her hands

194
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:06,419
but this is from soy normally get from
eggs and at this

195
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,770
I've personally for so I over

196
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,120
ok

197
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,210
so basically we mix or less and less
than some of the fire

198
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,760
I means it takes fat and water and mix
it together because fat water don't like

199
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,330
to mix

200
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,169
as when you are blessed them something
like if you had an egg yolk into a salad

201
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,630
dressing

202
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,360
you helping at all mixed together
basically so I'm just adding fake less

203
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,270
at the minute to

204
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:34,500
are rather na nag was something in it to
let the water gets the bottom that's why

205
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,260
it's not actually

206
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,220
moving is trying to create a vortex in
the bottom see basically

207
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,250
if you go in your kitchen and you know
why everything's happening in a

208
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,070
scientific level

209
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,360
you can base would be a lot more
creative and at the same thing with

210
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,070
hacking as well

211
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,020
area

212
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,300
for Texas

213
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,269
former this

214
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:06,350
that's asking a lot thicker

215
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:12,029
this

216
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:14,440
Dominik Paris

217
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,290
love you get the money

218

best to date you know it's it's ok Ave

220

plant the Blue Agave takes eight years
to mature in the roasted in

221

the state police go and it's really
super sugary things that's a lot it's

222
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,470
had a lot for 20 sets of luck honey

223
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:38,700
it's appropriate for diabetics on and it
because the other 33

224

226
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,200
crickets of the creaminess

227
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:57,200
love cream right now so I'm gonna on

228
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,540
thanks so much

229
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:05,540
how yeah

230

analytic form essential oil

231
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,700
that should be fine and at the same here
know how to crack a

232
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:25,310
knight-ridder container up

233
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,310

234
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:34,970
so gonna fill the man glad I brought
more up a stock's years

235
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:38,250
has how many people have the desired
they were yesterday

236
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:41,710
yeah sweet thank you I joined promoter

237
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,640
just pictures on real super tight guy
with it was okay so here's what would

238
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,840
happen if we have liquid nitrogen the
phone

239
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,110
you ready for this it the phone right
for the puppy thing

240
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,000
like it when you're sitting on your
plate so if you do does the trick for

241
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,800
the Fat Duck to do the same thing except
that it with an ever kinda phone these

242
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,890
the process to make it

243
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,390
I'm basically you take this phone bubble
on it spirit he put it into a ball that

244
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,890
would not give you much as negative a
hundred ninety one degrees

245
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,530
who dis got caught a with negative 191
degrees

246
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,780
the outside a bit freezes and
crystallizes

247
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,730
but the inside still phone so when you
take it and put in your mouth on a spoon

248
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,910
it's hard I sitting in her mouth the
person the phone coats and culture mouth

249
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,580
it changes face right from a solid from
a solid to a liquid in your mouth which

250
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,669
is very surprising

251
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,920
and it puts her mouth and get the flavor
like all over your dollar amounts per

252
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,220
night

253
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,920
at the fact that they do with a a vodka
lime green tea mints

254
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:39,910
I'm and it's really super nice because
the the green teas cleanse your palate

255
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,010
as an astringent the vodka culture mouth
with vodka

256
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:46,129
which is great I'm I was a great because

257
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,600
fact is soluble in alcohol and fat is
what carries flavors

258
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,270
so at the beginning if your meal you
have this your mouth has been coated

259
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,000
with alcohol and then you really he s
got is delicious

260
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,390
right because all the butter and so they
put in your food is a paralegal

261
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,760
howitzer snatchers is gelling products
another one thing to put the first batch

262
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,950
but maybe not this batch

263
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,550
is that work it does is that working I
was a mere words was left and

264
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,100
think there's in the box I who s nitrous

265
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:15,270
I okay with sister

266
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,639
others from it up with the so this is
okay this is a good example to put some

267
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:18,890
in

268
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,090
his preliminary I guess or gonna do

269
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:26,880
is a nitrous was a reading this the
first back to this

270
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,630
and so armpit rushing for a different
coming is it into a gelling agent called

271
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,910
phantom comic

272
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,200
car if you choose a

273
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,310
which is totally natural to the health
food store although my moms and it's a

274
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,639
mystery freakin she

275
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,960
think sample gonna the very people
because it's an additive but not all at

276
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,590
once or bad

277
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:50,310
a so they have them come is basically
there's a bacteria called

278
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,070
X camp estrace and it makes present in
camp estrace and it makes this a

279
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,280
by product in the byproduct is this %uh
really long carbohydrate that when you

280
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,110
put water

281
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:03,190
around it starts gumming up and making
and jelly ish so we can add just a

282
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,760
little bit

283
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,470
example under shear I look we aren't
like this

284
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:11,000
a so under undershirts cattle but isn't
them until

285
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,690
justice to the phones up right for
example powdered

286
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,230
is gonna go from a liquid

287
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,650
so nice pic pace the phone

288
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:27,370
and put down your place you love it and

289
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:33,660

00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,850
the back checking the box

308
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:48,679
has a dehydrator and put blueberries at
the height reader

309
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,850
an enemy blueberry powder and it looks
like some sort of weird cyber drug

310
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:57,070
you read about a wimp shatter novel and
I as it were Potter

311
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:01,110
every blended it week with sit with a
bunch of a sugar and sea salt

312
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:04,280
so we have that salty flavor in the
salty flavor

313
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,870
I we put soften something about Moses
you taking a cell wall right when you

314
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,490
put out food

315
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,200
and as a are professionals there's a
vacuum with water in its reports of our

316
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,220
osmosis draws the water out of the back
your

317
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:17,510
a cost which the flavor that's why use
all the brownies and and

318
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,750
for the chocolate you're trying to make
brownies taste like salt you're trying

319
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,510
to draw out

320
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,299
some of the water civic flavor
concentrates and so as you pull this off

321
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:25,830
on this

322
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,199
this um this week pistachio phone we
just made

323
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,370
doesn't a its gonna preciate the south a
little more and salted caramel is a

324
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:33,929
really nice

325
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:38,370
combination as well anyway my hands for
psych I would also this list we'll

326
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:41,600
so that we'll is thank you but business
careful chunks

327
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,350
are smoked paprika and rose water so
there's a lot of oral stuff in this food

328
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,000
or making

329
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,790
there's a rose water there's bergamot
and there's this I aromatic tarragon

330
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,428
right here

331
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:53,780
the tear gone um it's really humid so
normally this is really crispy tear

332
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,260
concerts little mushy right now

333
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,960
up it's really humid misleads egg whites
and its dipped in sugar

334
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,580
and investors giving out the recipes for
things like this and maybe some

335
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,250
restaurants do that maybe some don't I
think that's a big thing about food

336
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:06,400
hacking is open sourcing a recipe is
right

337
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,659
at either Creative Commons in their
licensing drivers with website to hack a

338
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:10,230
dot com

339
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:13,669
should check it out it's got a lot of
recipes on it and assume the wiki a

340
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:14,380
second to

341
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,600
or some other we're techniques out those
are some gelling agents there's other

342
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,480
ones like Joe Maddon gelatin alginate so
for example a WD 50 when they do this

343
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,340
out that this deep fried many sq

344
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,520
it but two different gelling agents in
it want to keep it

345
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,470
that solid shape the other want to not
make it run so it's gonna be really

346
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,510
solid it's good it's hot it's hot man is

347
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,309
of course gonna run but it doesn't it
just stays in this like really thick

348
00:32:34,309 --> 00:32:34,889
block

349
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,620
on this water really cool um other
things to do with jelly agency other

350
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,309
dish we had their

351
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:42,629
was a we had a metal cellulose noodles
would have this really long

352
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,380
strip chemical chemical called methyl
cellulose you get this really nice both

353
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,080
miso soup

354
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,460
and have a squirt bottle full of noodle
and slick with squirt bottle and

355
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,450
submerge in water

356
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,090
you squeeze all out and it makes a
noodle the what the liquid

357
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:59,429
sesame turns into with sesame noodle and
you pick up in a fork in it as a new

358
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:03,210
so that's a that's another gelling agent
something you had to water to I've got

359
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,320
something you had to

360
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,770
a liquid to make it show up others also
papers and pasta so we are talking about

361
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,840
the dehydrator

362
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,220
a lot of a big thing is these people are
on tai chi Chi chocolate paper in

363
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,230
passion for paper

364
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:17,429
it's what you do is you mix a gelling
agent with some sort of a

365
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,260
with something like passion fruit juice
or whatever and then you kinda just

366
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,570
squeegee it out onto

367
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,850
a tray like the one over here and then
you up with the dehydrator

368
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:27,840
and you get this nice fin paper
depending on which Joe it since you put

369
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,090
in it

370
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,520
when the dishes at the Fat Duck which is
my drug maker every other day

371
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,020
or whatever was weeded out the Listerine
strips right

372
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:38,629
it is this research is that we had a it
said that flavor we had oak and oak moss

373
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,210
flavored

374
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,860
and was part of this dish that meant you
were in the forest for seniors you put

375
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,919
this Listerine strip in your mouth the
way to dissolve

376
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:48,540
and as ok and oak moss and then he
disliked ruffle

377
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:51,790
walnut toast that psycho killers
troubles I'm on the floor the forest and

378
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,620
those truffles

379
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,630
and as I compared and Ag has like you
know mangosteen quayle

380
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,040
Pisa for grinding I can be everything in
the forest I'm

381
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm the floor before estimating its
bounty and I

382
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,919
so that's a different kind of alginate
I'm who are Listerine uses pull and

383
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,750
gotten a different kind of coming at you
something totally different but it's you

384
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,389
know it's like three or four different
from

385
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,429
gelling agent that have different kinds
of qualities the light you basically

386
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:16,350
squeegee out

387
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,429
is really family of stuff and then let
it dry for a day then cut its

388
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:23,970
if they pick you up I'm so that make
good anyways Negro before

389
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:28,639
alright bigger of them for the Japanese
if you like guys like definitely if

390
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,859
the broadest rice MSG right

391
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:37,080
watching a motor which is a which I i St
is basically the powdery stuff that's on

392
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,389
seaweed answers really concentrated
flavor that mommy

393
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:43,480
and this is made about a hundred years
ago with isolated by this but this

394
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,190
doctor whose

395
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:48,230
really hooked up food world by isolating
the fifth set the 50s

396
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,820
right to taste buds right taste buds are
telling your your mind

397
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,369
why to keep this thing it's like if it's
sweet you like the old baby

398
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:58,720
if isset sugary it's giving energy if
it's all the figures do not get

399
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,540
dehydrated he beat this itself if it's
our it's cuz it that's the tickets acid

400
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,100
if it's better it's because it's an
alkali it was poisons are alkaline

401
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,100
and but so if it's if it's a free which
is another test which is sort of like

402
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,130
tomatoes or seaweed your MSG you really
see very much

403
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,430
firms such cokie it's basically telling
your body I'm

404
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:19,339
this is an amino acid this is a rival
nucleic acid that we need for our body

405
00:35:19,339 --> 00:35:21,060
to generate ourselves

406
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:24,950
and so that's what msg is it's a good
good hammock acid on so they also that

407
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,279
other thing called me clear

408
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,470
annie cruz when it would use your
muscles and some Packers 2-2

409
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,720
are you rip your you rip your tissues

410
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,240
all the time microscopical tears it's
your body makes me think of

411
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,500
transglutaminase

412
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,250
which joins back the muscles joints the
back together and then not so

413
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,240
the Japanese of course if the size this
was enzymes and see take a stake

414
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,369
raw steak and they take a raw chicken
breast and you sprinkle some on the

415
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:48,940
steak

416
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,850
and sprinkle some %uh chicken breast and
putting together and two hours later the

417
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,549
same piece %uh me

418
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:59,060
the creek crossings the proteins it's a
it's transglutaminase

419
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,369
and then and the fried on the on the on
the stove and you've got

420
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:06,600
you have steak breast or whatever it's
called and people here yeah it's weird

421
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,650
what you can and you can get like free
samples out you just go to as a few I

422
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:10,010
mean

423
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,040
this Google for Activa it that's the
third straight game or whatever

424
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,160
and a it's it's pretty nasty they must
seize a flick firming up noodles

425
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,190
0 are we on the Internet apparently not
okay

426
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,690
so basically its collective on some
other cool techniques I'm

427
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,460
freeze-dried food you can use a freeze
our we could actually talk about

428
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,980
squeezing out films

429
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:31,170
hydrosol so it's kinda interesting was a
restaurant called John Rocca which were

430
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,900
passed out his book it's his book is on
I'm backing cuisine

431
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,970
by the way don't steal the books police
know if you're still the book rare

432
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:41,140
silver cuff get back I'm this guy this
guy John Rocca makes a dirt

433
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,589
a dirt jelly order hydrosol

434
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:47,650
as we got you have just you sure you
have to still whiskey right

435
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:51,000
it is you boil things and you distill
the distilling column so what you should

436
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,470
put if you want to still something

437
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,900
you put in a you know you know in a a
beaker flask

438
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,119
you boil it and you catch the steam with
an ice column

439
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,150
and condense that steam that's how you
distill something right

440
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:06,350
so this guy does as he puts dirt and
water and boils it

441
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:10,380
and condenses the steam and has this
pure water

442
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:15,200
that is like his dirt his dirt is
delicious

443
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,900
because it's like is in the basque
country where cut a line or something

444
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,369
like that his deserts awesome

445
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:23,550
as this really good there and and its
its and it doesn't get nothing

446
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,180
the only thing that made it over is
anything that could be boiled and

447
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,640
evaporated in condensed

448
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,890
so that's a quarter a that people do
that

449
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:34,580
now in it but you have to have a five
thousand dollar distal leader apparatus

450
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:39,190
make it super cool what now it's a
chilly but not now

451
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,980
know you get those players now you can
you can have sensual oils for anything

452
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,490
but this is more like for in the field

453
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:48,000
so juego wanted to make a you know the
dirt in northern california with Jelly

454
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,960
Belly factory is

455
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,530
us player jodie that have to do that
mostly have a such a whilst we have some

456
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,640
such over here

457
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,680
I'm their pine and camphor we do with
chocolates with eucalyptus chocolate a

458
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,040
burger much chocolate as

459
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,190
messes up your power is pretty cool and
the fact that they do our weather

460
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,880
chocolate

461
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,660
ok chocolate tobacco chocolate if this
is a couple drops about such well im the

462
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,549
chocolate and it just

463
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:11,650
you know that's the essential
characteristic flavor of it

464
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,540
I'm so enabling to cart sir to talk to a
modified breakfasts

465
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm they often say okay to freeze drying
and modify breakfast so is every 50

466
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,630
again

467
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,359
and its there's only maybe ten
restaurants not say to do this kinda

468
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:23,730
food

469
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,240
and that's among the most part my talk
about the hacking about the fact that

470
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,319
part that parts actually produce pretty
small

471
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:32,109
so fucking about the weird technologies
right now to do a freeze dried food at W

472
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,190
fifty where it's

473
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:36,850
for the freeze-dried some bananas inch
and strawberries

474
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:40,620
and it was discovered serial with cold
milk it's a cold milk

475
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:45,540
ice cream surrounded by crushed a as
lieutenant the 50 minutes here

476
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,859
9:45 much that says I want to go anyway
it's a it's a

477
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:53,390
as ice it's a its ok I called ice milk
ice cream surrounded by

478
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,100
ground-up homemade corn flakes since
this was ball

479
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,569
cornflakes surrounding ice cream would
like but it's a free Stratford it's

480
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:01,150
pretty cool

481
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,520
I say so but how clubs in the next 10
minutes apparently I'm

482
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,420
this it's basically setting up a
laboratory devoted to cuisine so where I

483
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,270
worked factor have a dedicated lab

484
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,750
the Opelika close six months out of the
year with Awkal faster few restaurants

485
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,380
can afford to have a dedicated

486
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:17,880
pack lap a dedicated like food where the
a lower the developing such they develop

487
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,630
on the job

488
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,920
which sometimes is good sometimes as bad
as a restaurant struggling here

489
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,150
the charge to a fifty dollars to the two
hundred the twenty five course meal

490
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,330
and like I had it why does awesome but
most it was not good because it's that

491
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,720
weird stuff but he just invented that
morning

492
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,250
is like trying out on people's guinea
pigs I'm there's also

493
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,280
second gathered over plates on our
plates but I want to put their fingers

494
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:39,780
noble

495
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,609
will come up afterwards there are there
up so that that's basically how you

496
00:39:43,609 --> 00:39:44,210
develop

497
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,030
how you step back but if you've a
restaurant you have to be making that 3

498
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,260
percent profit margin

499
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,470
some compare up with industrial
designers and chemists bike up here

500
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,819
conyers restaurant I'm

501
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:56,630
in France Paris pairs up with a really
I'm weird dude named after ladies

502
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,839
to like you know invent all this stuff
in an outbuilding to figure it out and

503
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:02,819
conservative people so the ghetto Tek
this is what really makes acting which

504
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:03,660
is restaurants

505
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,069
are doing it for money I'm doing it
personally to for the real and to

506
00:40:07,069 --> 00:40:10,490
collaborate with my friends and offer
money our customers and our proprietary

507
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:13,970
documents at their techniques and
experiences I think I have

508
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,490
a wiki page here we go is the food
hacking Wiki Wiki typhoon packing dot

509
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,450
com sir suma quickly we talked about

510
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:22,960
some ingredients a like like me glue and
techniques

511
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,650
so basically this is give a huge wiki
that is has a lot of weird

512
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,290
science a food stuff on it saying
courage you to apply for an account

513
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,509
and I help edit it so what are the
experimentations let's talk a little bit

514
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,069
about that

515
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:37,410
i've a kitchen in San Francisco I'm
Joe's I have a kitchen and what we do a

516
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,350
lot of weird esoteric ingredients

have

518
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,029
your wormwood we do more with a lot
because it's got the psychoactive

519
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,660
ingredient

520
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,270
copters own and fears own send you one
spirit quest straight

521
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,460
it's like because that is the easiest or
trying like worked out in the food in

522
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,660
some way that doesnt

523
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,960
tip of your body that it's a bitter
poison which is what we're what is

524
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,690

527
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:09,770
safra a its because like this we should

528
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,680
smoke weed and read cookbooks that's my
life

529

diet when you're pregnant

is this that's the first step

605
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,359

developed your next step is when your

606

mother breast feed you assume you're not
you know your breast fed

your moms breast milk is going it's your

608
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,140
body that with simply for Michael's

609
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,379
the next step requiring the how it hurts
his acetates is

610
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:42,830
socialization you see your mom your
blood mom and what your moms eating

611
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:46,100
Bob that you want your touch it and we
see your dad

612
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,520
like him too probably and the way his
stuff the Nexus the social sites where

613
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,690
you see your friends eating and you
really want one Sabal sir Pokemon

614
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,220
whatever thing yes we know she's okay so
here's the deal though here's the bad

615
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,650
news:

616
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,369
when your six that is when your palate
is at its best

617
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:04,770
and then it goes downhill there for the
rest of your life and thats

618
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,890
that's white kids are picky about food
if the sense of smell

619
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:11,618
you have 7 tastes really good trick you
can do you happen to cuba

620
00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:15,710
potato happens cuba Apple with your nose
being held which touched this year I

621
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,369
order

622
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:19,680
up with you know thing I did as figure
up with your nose because

623
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,310
the only difference between those two
things that the same taste buds

624
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:23,520
different smell

625
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,630
right so basically there's that his idea
super tasty as well so be so you're your

626
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,130
tire

627
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,240
your sense of smell goes downhill me
your sense of taste because

628
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,700
flavor is your taste buds times or smell
you can smell 20,000 different things

629
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,250
by the time you're 40 its goes really
downhill by this time for sixty it's

630
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:39,960
almost gone

631
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,609
which is why I hope you put like sugar
and salt in their food cuz that's what

632
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:43,540
they can face

633
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,660
now that doesn't happen if you're like a
wine taster it doesn't happen if you

634
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,779
train your palate everyday

635
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,950
is napping if you've got a weird stuff
if you live on a farm probably

636
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,100
and your snowing things all the time and
so I'm

637
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:56,700
I think what you're asking is is there
their weights like mess around with

638
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,120
south with smells and

639
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,850

aromatic elements which is this for a

640
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:04,350
moment things are not used to eating
which is burger mott

641
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:08,910
