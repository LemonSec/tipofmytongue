43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,429

46
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,549
seminar which was taking place on the 64
thats was actually for the whole

47
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,770
conference or something is going on at
the same time

48
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,940
I who is I'm committee conference being
led by Steve around them the

49
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,810
I'm private investigator who has been
every single one of our own conferences

50
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,420
in

51
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,190
knows an awful lot about these things
and went very well we had the

52
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,260
seminars are intensive seminars that
went for I I think so in the morning

53
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,370
until about four o'clock

54
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,720
well are right after it ended at four
o'clock

55
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,970
I rather quietly and without much fuss
these

56
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,020
two guys came up behind Steve asked if
he had any weapons

57
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,040
and identify themselves as the FBI the
last thing we saw was Kevin I was asking

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,640
being led away in handcuffs

59
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,910
so yeah it's a it's all I want

60
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,840
wanna tell you what's going on said no
rumors get started that's what we know

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,610
as we know we're gonna try to find out
is of all the people in this place he's

62
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,870
the last person I would expect to get
arrested

63
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,430
he's the one that would be arresting
others but I mean we're talking about

64
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,430
somebody who hunts down nazi zombie the
world and I'm

65
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,250
is discredit finding fining people I
guess

66
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,920
he found the wrong person or they found
him or something I

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,980
so that's going to obviously affect this
panel I we have the people here

68
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,110
who are going to be on the panel and if
asking people if they're experts in all

69
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,200
sources on

70
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,900
I love cool things like polygraph
machines in and and databases and things

71
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,670
like that so

72
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:06,110
they're gonna tell you their stories and
experiences and take your questions

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:10,940

specialties I the

157
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,339
a bit on polygraph as an investigative
tool

158
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,670
throughout my

159
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,839
27 years old very polygraph examinations
and doing interview and interrogation

160
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:53,839
we caught interview notes that
irrigation misdirected have over thirty

161
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
billion dollars in

162
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,630
recovered still still wanna
misappropriated property

163
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,920
missus you may have some questions about
that

164
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,750
love these things were big cases

165
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,750
that were intellectual property which

166
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,959
was stolen a through the use a
politician interview process

167
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:18,130
and other investigative techniques we
were able to recover these

168
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,339
losses you may have some questions about
the Ashington

169
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,050
they also go to booking corporate
investigations a have written a couple

170
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,930
chapters for

171
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,130
below the French investigation books so

172
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,640
know how many more you guys really

173
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,430
get a Canadian handcuffs but you may
need it removed the shades investigative

174
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,269
it sometime

175
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:44,730
I was anxious to come here because

176
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,110
you guys this morning it's curious what
your

177
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,829
so many things I reading this so book

178
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:57,750
2006 going with AC

the

182
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:13,660
speak to these people like this first
gate so I guess it would have to do that

183
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,850
because shit way over my head

184
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:20,990

185
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,270

to figure out my contact list

188
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,230

197
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:29,660
mine okay

198
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,920
my impression you're free

199
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,380
polygraph tests are only permitted in
certain instances with the reason it's

200
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,130
not permitted

201
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,740
others what are those instances where it
is or is not permit

202
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:47,330
Ridge well what you will use for first
what's not to like to see

203
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:52,410
were calligraphy %uh polygraph exam and

204
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,689
it's allowed the 1i circumstances not
many it isn't allowed

205
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,560
what you have an example just my
impression

206
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,040
actually that's the biggest misnomer the
mall

207
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,349
it is admissible in court it's
admissible under stipulation if you were

208
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,470
charged with the crime

209
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,760
which many of us maybe at some point I'm

210
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,050
and you know you are a tease you can ask
your Terry

211
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,300
have a a polygraph exam run a few

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,640
I would do that with your own polygraph
examiner before you went to the law

213
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,140
enforce

214
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,610
examine if in fact you watch truthful

215
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,790
and your polygraph backs that up you can
go to the prosecutor

216
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,969
the prosecuting atty and ask them first

217
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,730
what's called the stipulated polygraph
so you're right it wouldn't be

218
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,440
admissible in that situation either

219
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,560
what would happen is if if the
prosecuted

220
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
just Tardio whether the prosecutorial
armies

221
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,700
agrees to that a you prove to them that
you passed the polygraph

222
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,290
there will be any charges charges be
dropped so therefore

223
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:03,459
it's not admitted that particular
situation but it could be admitted

224
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:08,209
as long as it stipulates to in the trial
at the time it's it's my impression

225
00:14:08,209 --> 00:14:12,040
that employers as I am one

226
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,599
is not permitted to routinely do
polygraph exams employees when there's

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,000
no

228
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,740
investigation that's correct okay what's
the reasoning

229
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:27,740
what would be it was a rough 1988 play
polygraph Protection Act 1988 that's

230
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:28,660
ongoing

231
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,510
what's the reason the reason for that is
%uh politicians

232
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,709
got this bill passed and

233
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,350
adj AF President signed it who was at
the precious I could be the with the bed

234
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:47,350
prosecuted for the country scandal
president reagan

235
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:51,500
came into office and was the biggest
proponent a polygraph that

236
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
we have seen in the white house he
wanted all the CIA agents FBI agents at

237
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,010
all

238
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:04,010
our politicians elected officials
polygraphs was very popular at the time

239
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:09,029
because the polygraph at that point was
in its heyday was working very well

240
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:12,540
a through the

241
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,389
early nineteen eighties we have cases I
love

242
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,199
like Tylenol I did a couple extra repins
the cheese doodles

243
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,819
I see with no about 40 books

244
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:30,049
the cracker jacks by system I was a good
one in order to eliminate suspects

245
00:15:30,049 --> 00:15:34,319
we use two polygraph and it's a great
way to eliminate suspects if you have

246
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,600
five or six other people in a factory in
any one of them had the availability to

247
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:37,959
do

248
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,529
what do these things we could eliminate
them very quickly

249
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,029
as suspects so that was in the early
eighties

250
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:48,410
by the mid-eighties way the alley north
was under the gun

251
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,029
and swallowing his sword for his
president and his country

252
00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,009
a in a move Kennedy

253
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:59,329
use the was today

254
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,450
who did didn't like didn't like
polygraph very much

255
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,860
early there was a thing in
Chappaquiddick in autographed

256
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,980
self

257
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,350
what happened was a ed who was pressured

258
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,000
the weapons by himself really does come
up with things by himself he was

259
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,190
pressured by Big Labor

260
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,380
because big labor didn't like polygraphs
because if people would be

261
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,079
polygraphs around the country and being
fired wholesale with that

262
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:33,019
whatever because a polygraph
examinations

263
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:36,490
they come up with this employee
polygraph Protection Act and what that

264
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,529
calls for

265
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,829
is no more pre employment or continuing

266
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,850
continued employment policies which is
referred to as periodic

267
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,870
the word she would come into a factory
or two

268
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,860
a jewelry store is a classic example of
how many times have you stolen since we

269
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,399
last polygraph dude

270
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,519
that was eliminated and the
pre-employment polygraphs eliminate

271
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,779
except for guess so government anything
to do with the

272
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,160
armored cars security offices banks
things like that

273
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,209
those were limited taken as that bill so
for all intents and purposes

274
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,299
big labor a big Kennedy

275
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,379
got his way and

276
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,380
pretty much destroyed allegations but
now the politicians just taken a new

277
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:22,890
turn

278
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,280
what'd using polygraph for is

279
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,010
testing recidivism rates

280
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,760
in child molesters and sexual offenders
in many states out west

281
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,100
in order to stay outta jail get out of
jail

282
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,110
a convicted felons child molesters

283
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:45,120
sexual offenders have to take periodic

284
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,850
polygraphs every month to there you have
to come in

285
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,639
answer questions about their sexual
activities

286
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,809
the period before think that's was where
progress going let me Angela Merkel

287
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,780
think in the employment room what you're
getting at is you can't single out an

288
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,450
employee so in other words if you've got
internal theft going on

289
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,740
it happens to be in a particular room
you have to

290
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,080
investigate everyone that had access to
that room before you can start asking

291
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,270
them to take a polygraph

292
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,780
Indian you have to give them a
sufficient time varies

293
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,280
state state forty two hours every two
hours give them notice

294
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,290
that there appeared a certain location
for a polygraph

295
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:28,658
in a given that time frame in order to
seek legal advice

296
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,179
federal the federal actually cause for
48 hour period

297
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,500
have to their request to take a
polygraph you have before you can ask

298
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,260
anybody take a polygraph now for a
specific laws even

299
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:42,120
you have to interview them make sure
that there are real possibility

300
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,559
real suspect before you can even ask to
take a polygraph forty-eight hours

301
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,110
notice at that point written notice
before you get it

302
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,419
even polygraph they can have their
lawyer present rabbi the priest

303
00:18:55,419 --> 00:18:58,840
wife the mother whoever they want for
the pre

304
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,439
test interview after the pretest
interview

305
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,690
polygraph examiner this subject do the
test

306
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,169
for the post-test interview you can have
a representative available also

307
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:15,480
that's basically how the world works

308
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,790
thank you

309
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,350
the town wants to know that courts
compelling test I'm soiling

310
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,490
once know that the courts complex case
complète sanibel ordered

311
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,540
a bike what's to test people for

312
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,670
the judge the judge wants to know and
they have

313
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,570
put in a court order that one party or
the other or both

314
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,340
have to take polygraph tests regarding a
particular question thanks again

315
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,850
recommended

316
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:50,410
if you're going to volunteer to take
that you get your own examiner

317
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,060
the law enforcement agencies so the
implication

318
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,909
sensei here is that they're are met its
for an examiner to use

319
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,530
that will skew the results in the
direction they want them to go

320
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,889
correct and if so as absolutely correct
what and examine some examples

321
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,600
that you examined to make the test go
either way because it's subjective

322
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,030
this is not its it's somewhat scientific
in that the basement ACLU's

323
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,550
a polygraph is the one recording device
it records your body functions

324
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,659
bodily functions physiological reactions
to questions

325
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,810
to stimuli by put a gun to Jerry said

326
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,679
jerry Zgoda whether he moves in he looks
like he's reacting to you

327
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:39,680
his body functions are going to react
change of

328
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:45,330
are there also why

329
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,889
shall we say differences opinion
interpretation

330
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,220
test results not for

331
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,430
polygraph exam is that it's free a

332
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,630
have the education and keep up with
their education the

333
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,540
the in order to go to you go to
polygraph school you have to have a

334
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,649
bachelor's degree after five years
investigative experience

335
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,350
its a week intensive program and its
26-week

336
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:16,350
it's it's really an on-the-job

337
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,980
type thing where you have to do 25 test
within that six months

338
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,820
that are closely watched by your euro
your instructor to make sure you doing

339
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,740
everything properly

340
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,660
and it's a it's quite intense the

341
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,370
biggest thing in the polygraph test is
the polygraph examiner has to

342
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,860
psychologically said

343
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,000
the subject to to

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,690
make them aware that this works it will
work with them that's done is

345
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,690
number ways I don't know this is a real
question or more of a topic

346
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,230
when you're talking about investigating
people in different armies

347
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,590
soldiers things like that I was thinking
about the soldiers in Iraq you know

348
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,510
belong to a country that are kind of
like the outsourced soldiers that we

349
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:04,490
hear about to you

350
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:08,050
you got into that at all or work those
cases

351
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,450
you talking about the Merc's yeah wells

352
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,620
most of them are former military and

353
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,000
the Baltimore American and British does
the Americans and the brits

354
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,800
the largest private military well they
don't call mercenaries anymore

355
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,610
now call private military companies

356
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:32,679
go figure but I guess they don't confuse

357
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,730
mercedes-benz merck's so

358
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,419
yeah they they sometimes I have had to

359
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:47,080
find people like that technically
speaking I'm not investigate what I do

360
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,399
is almost basically your expert

361
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,750
military research military records and I
do to help locate people

362
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,340
which is why private investigators me
because

363
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,459
military records research is actually a
maze

364
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,260
anybody looking for most investigators

365
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,840
most private citizens know that you can
get a person or a Veterans records from

366
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,030
saint louis Missouri

367
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,178
however as I pointed out little

368
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:19,480
speech this morning there are over 160
locations in this country where you can

369
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,820
find military records

370
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,760
was gonna find what you're looking for
in saint louis traditional

371
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
where they are find wider there

372
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,640
so somebody's people if they've done
other veterans

373
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,309
and they join a private military company
I usually find the information

374
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:40,780
on them from the military career turn it
over to a private investigator

375
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,500
tries to track them down although I can
locate military personnel

376
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,030
these private companies there now
military

377
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:52,379
personnel there under military control
you would have to do

378
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,770
investigation on them just like you
would have to do an investigation on

379
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:59,679
any employee of private company because
that's what they are

380
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,690
he's a private companies so you're fines
and employment search basically this

381
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,980
I my questions from suki ni

382
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,340
are you any way affiliated with them to
seal

383
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,649
which is the let's just say I know them

384
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,970
you know them in a few other seals very

385
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:22,750
in really tight with the British SAS as
well perfect and in my next question the

386
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,580
for someone who's actually interested in

387
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:28,299
investigation is for the career what
kinda tips could you

388
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,350
give someone in the crowd that would be
to start in that sort of

389
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,809
with education which is start from with
what's a good starting

390
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,030
want two things most people still use

391
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,629
read read read then take courses to

392
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:48,120
I used to teach even on not a private
investigator for about 11 years

393
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,250
to a private investigation for for
Cooper

394
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,909
education services state your also
certified security guards truck drivers

395
00:24:56,909 --> 00:25:00,630
but I never bothered

396
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,929
going out to get PI license because

397
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:07,530
for a while there because the other side
businesses

398
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,820
counterterrorism terrors research which

399
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,210
as you might guess busy these days

400
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,450
I just didn't have the time

401
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,620
I could not do any investigative work
because

402
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,429
on surveillance hours that I might be
needed somewhere else for something else

403
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:28,780
so its largest military research

404
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,799
terrorism there's courses you can take
one thing I have to tell you there's a

405
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,549
lot of people

406
00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:39,210
were under this misconception even
students mile

407
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,600
when they came into my class runners
same miss

408
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,760
misconception about this you can not
become a private investigator

409
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,740
get a license simply by a 10 course even
if its credit

410
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:56,770
for instance the state in New York
reporters

411
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,399
three years field service before you can
even take the test

412
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:05,929
dozen they don't CT scan like an
apprenticeship program

413
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:09,530
next basically a except you get paid for
thank you

414
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,940
I was wondering what kind of message

415
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,190
whether non-technical or technical both

416
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,220
military side as well as general you
guys used to gather the information

417
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,620
is it still through the mail by fax or
are a lot more

418
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,640
databases sure prolly are

419
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,360
months answers technologies

420
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,429
more tech well be honest with you

421
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:44,159
military and the things it as low-tech
as it gets

422
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,679
because they have never

423
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
and they will never put military
personnel files

424
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,280
on a database all military records or
paper files

425
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,520
however there is side

426
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,440
just you step 2: now

427
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,390
just go to the website persons name
social security number

428
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,020
you know that ended tell you if they're
active duty

429
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,429
now you said they don't they don't store
that information

430
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:25,620
i'd company's top I work for

431
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,940
I'll under he said the only do it paper

432
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,460
for military records what about
situations with via laptop

433
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,960
in other situations okay that's thats
databases entirely different color

434
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,659
that type databases for VA claims

435
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:47,340
if you make its and it's separate from
basically said from the Department of

436
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,309
Defense

437
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:52,309
is Veterans Affairs which is different
even though they may seem as if they're

438
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:53,460
saying

439
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,540
two separate entities this is s

440
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,649
yet world the VA's stress

441
00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:04,880
a they have all these

442
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,860
names on there because make be a claim

443
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:12,340
the VA with a record obviously any

444
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,799
company like with it benefits

445
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,820
we or play

446
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,770
at the same time duty personnel families
are also eligible for a lot of these

447
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,790
benefits

448
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:27,110
so its waters dependence information on
that story

449
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,940
was on that stolen database

450
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,990
found out that I was on it my wife is a
22-21

451
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:39,059
your name she was on my son from my
first marriage is on

452
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,710
on that same thing because we all got
out after Sir

453
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,580
7 that said

454
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,710
on the PI side the more technical

455
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,899
yes other than male yeah could you
describe any

456
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,059
not specifically what the sources are

457
00:28:58,059 --> 00:29:01,309
companies otherwise

458
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:06,760
is it database structure just client
application

459
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,280
you guys use to lose a lot of databases
out there

460
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,879
news and sometimes I used in conjunction
with military stuff to 'em try to locate

461
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,570
somebody

462
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:20,350
because if its military personnel
stationed in the states nine times

463
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,409
as a civilian address so you gonna
