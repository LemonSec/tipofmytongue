1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,899
course I'm model cuz I think people sort
of

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,080
memorize it in a way that maybe
interferes with understanding rather

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,870
than help that

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:12,940
but

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,259
the I need to talk about it a little bit
because the three protocols that on and

6
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,820
talk about

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,770
are RSTP

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,770
which are Steve he's used by a layer 2
switches

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,380
but issues with flooding

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,330
to for the same role as other things and
talking about so this is this is where

11
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:41,870
to

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,870
okay

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:57,620
I

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,170
so this is where to and or SPF

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:05,570
an is rise yes

16
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,820
these are layer 3

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:15,440
and only these two

18
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,460
are

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,560
I P this one isn't only IP but

20
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,110
lot of people use an IP networks this
one when I talk about it and as a rock

21
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,820
idea at all

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,970
not in the when discussing so anyway

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,289
the won the problems I have with the
layers

24
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,300
is I think all the interesting stuff

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,380
happens between the layers so

26
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:45,660
people tell you that layer 3

27
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,970
sipe or CL&P

28
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,119
for or so and

29
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,710
where to use third and Mac

30
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,620
and where one is like wires

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,720
which bid is transmitted first what

32
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,780
frequencies transmitted at electrically

33
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,090
stuff like that by this this is an awful

34
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,200
because I'm the interesting stuff is

35
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,530
in here with with wireless

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,520
you have all kinds of mess micah is

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,470
wireless stations register their

38
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,700
mac Address I'm on where one they do
retransmission

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,280
so the

40
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,950
I at 11 when you send in at 11 framed

41
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,210
the other the access point will
acknowledge the frame

42
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,320
if it doesn't receive the frame your
card will retransmit

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:54,200
inside the for more on the card so this
is something the 811 ties

44
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,970
because it's where one the radio is

45
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,920
so unreliable that it wouldn't work well
without this and the Grecians was an

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,250
hour them know something about

47
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,030
how long is it gonna take the package to
get there the time out a really short

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,640
because it's the speed of light

49
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,880
in their working around the limitations
on the radio to make it usable

50
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,320
but they're using where to stuff to do
it

51
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,100
so they've modified their lair to to
accommodate for this crappy where one

52
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,650
and it didn't work out of you ever tried
to

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:33,650
set up a wireless to station card has to
be like this

54
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:40,680
it's not possible

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,330
to put more stuff behind here

56
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,650
like

57
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,270
if use Linux bridging or something on
your wireless station car you try to

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,510
bridge your station

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,000
onto even an and then plug somebody
else's computer into it it won't work

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,890
because station gets one Mac

61
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,690
and then all these other these its

62
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,470
it spread to stay with the access point
is this makes sense I'm

63
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,900
are I DDC the

64
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,739
the problem with the lair one in there
too because we have this on reliable

65
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,109
where one

66
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,070
now we have problems bridging stations
on the internets so this is this is

67
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,370
confusing it's aware

68
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:31,990
violation arm the other thing that we
have in between where one where to is

69
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,490
on half duplex Ethernet there's so

70
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,710
we have you know to 11 and as a whole
mess and then we have

71
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,140
CSMA CD was everyone's heard about but
which is not used almost all modern

72
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,320
networks because there's

73
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,900
switches with full duplex by non if you
have a half duplex network

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,220
because %uh the way the wire works you
have this Mac where procedure

75
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,530
to I'm retransmission to physically

76
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,289
I'm and there's our

77
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,780
there's I'm those broadcasts

78
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,600
and and DNA your

79
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,760
where wanna wear to combination has two
accommodates sending a broadcast all the

80
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,430
stations

81
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,320
and there's a lot of telco where one
where two combinations

82
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,550
that have multiple stations on one where

83
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,330
one there to network but they can't do
broadcasts so you have to send

84
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:40,270
East I think ur talkin rings like that
too nicer Soraya anyways

85
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,700
this so the confusing with them although
I think we're talking about two

86
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,010
lawmakers interesting stuff is in here

87
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,969
I'm though

88
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,240
model wants you to think I've where to
use as

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,030
being underneath where three and
interchangeable so

90
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,020
I'm and you choose to use IP and then

91
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,020
I can pick whatever earlier too I want I
can

92
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,349
pic Ethernet yeah I'm

93
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:16,360
plane serial t1

94
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,460
and token ring

95
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:25,640
quietest openings or even at this Mac
cities and its

96
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,140
its it's not I'm because if you choose

97
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,909
if senator token ring than

98
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:39,550
in between here use are if

99
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,289
don't then you have to use something
else

100
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:48,750
like SLC your PPP

101
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,520
where the car I'm AP control protocol

102
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,630
so word is arco is are

103
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,529
elaire to standard because

104
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,469
if I'm using IPEX or even an there's no
art

105
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:10,150
or is it a layer 3 standard because if
I'm using

106
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,909
I P over t1 there's no are

107
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:17,300
so when know someone else sucks

108
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,430
but

109
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,089
back to this I maybe you have some

110
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:29,159
background our why I'm grouping these
things together

111
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,050
because it's something else essential
that all three and do in the way that

112
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,610
they're using practice

113
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,610
so I see site offers

114
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:50,849
so a stock first about the flooding

115
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:57,130
disaster

116
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,890
so if you have a network of switches

117
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:06,890
and then you have some stations

118
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:15,010
test yes given numbers

119
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:28,599
the the promise love and i gt is that

120
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,259
station 5 process and the packet
stitching to

121
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:35,568
that these switch

122
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:38,899
intermediate systems will know how to
route this pack

123
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,870
an the way this which is operated is

124
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,889
a all routing is based on the
destination address

125
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,449
my trying to reach is the destination so
we have a packet that's

126
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:57,109
from 5

127
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:00,579
to who

128
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:03,860
writing looks at this

129
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:10,860
hands

130
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,210
morning looks at this so

131
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,430
this

132
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:24,430
this packet here okay here

133
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,209
because everywhere

134
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:41,250
so there's no routing information for
how to reach to

135
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,639
I'm bike learning

136
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,759
as this packet is flowing through is
looking at this five

137
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,940
so as this packet a passes through

138
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,310
I'm the switch learns that

139
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,449
five is in that direction

140
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:02,889
so at this switch needs to send
something 25

141
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:07,040
won't bother sending out here an

142
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,939
the switch here lines are five

143
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,940
this I'm

144
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,970
so now if somebody sends packets be

145
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,889
from I'm station for

146
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:27,970
station 5

147
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,010
Stogran going to busy its bigger

148
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:39,010
I'm

149
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,490
store I'm

150
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,180
how to know how long its memory is it's
configurable

151
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,529
and it's not extremely important because
there's for the person this discussion

152
00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:55,579
there's other times when the memories
cleared

153
00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:00,990
by there are

154
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,110
some imaginable cases where

155
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,740
like if a station moves from here to
here

156
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,220
and stuff this remembered is wrong man

157
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,470
yeah it's kinda problem but when you
send out the new packet little

158
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,709
clearly other information on the way I
Harry

159
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:22,310
diagrams are cases for that part are so

160
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,060
who we were with packet be you've
already learned from Paquet

161
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,230
so packet the is trying to reach

162
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,660
station 5 so close to the switch

163
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,829
and packet be cause only this way

164
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,940
it is not go here like Paquet marriage
is a switch

165
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,149
echoes only here and doesn't go this way

166
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:48,510
so

167
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,200
now it's going straight through worse
before it was flooded

168
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,550
so that's what I mean by flooding

169
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:03,199
and learning

170
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,359
and this is non completely part

171
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:12,959
of are sticky if you discover what
acronym stands for its

172
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,160
spanning tree protocol there's no
spanning-tree here this is just a

173
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,079
regular switches

174
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:22,249
but spanning tree doesn't work with our

175
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:27,569
understanding this philosophy River Rd
sorrel

176
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:34,569
ice any questions about this again wanna
spanning tree

177
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:43,239
the question was

178
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:53,339
are packets ande

179
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:56,869
data packets are they routing packets
and

180
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:00,259
the answer isn't all UN truce RCP

181
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,439
there are no special control planes
which packets

182
00:13:05,439 --> 00:13:08,509
all these packets or station to station
data packets

183
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:13,089
so the idea is if you don't have this
learned information

184
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:17,910
then you can sprout the packet and you
just flooded everywhere

185
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,749
so if you have a huge mass switches

186
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:26,379
and no stations plugged into them before
we've introduced

187
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:31,569
are sticky still if you ignore that then
there's no traffic at all

188
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:38,309
and the switches don't know how to reach
anything so they rely on the 21st

189
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:40,110
cleaning station usually yes

190
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,949
dack Corey or something markets flooded

191
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,879
home on I'm there's other cases because
like

192
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,209
this be tacky I'm

193
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:59,189
learnings operating on this by

194
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:04,959
only these two switches have learned
about season for

195
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,119
so

196
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:13,419
station once in a pack a decision for

197
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:19,489
then it would be flooded to station to

198
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:23,410
by station 3 sent a decision for

199
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,949
sixties for Zack sense so

200
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:31,709
its its backers because the morning
works it's it's a little confusing

201
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,769
learning looks at the source and the
writing looks at the destination so

202
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,049
in the first case with packet a

203
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,779
everybody learned about

204
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:45,809
station 5 migrating from is in fact both
pack

205
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:49,199
being on everybody learner station for
so

206
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,230
sky furious stick like a memory Caceres
something

207
00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:00,230
else maybe

208
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,959
alright so the spanning-tree is if you
have I'm

209
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,779
this

210
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,230
is a real problem for flooding on
because

211
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,880
mine start with test first packet a

212
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,950
and there's no information for station
two man

213
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,399
and

214
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,870
assist experienced a similar works fine
something

215
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:51,870
I K goes here

216
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:59,500
anchors here

217
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:01,029
and

218
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,889
goes here and it's just

219
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:08,749
keeps going and it causes a storm

220
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:13,989
so the

221
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:17,839
I'm there's there's no hop counts for
anything

222
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,199
the switches because how cancer in their
30 Canada

223
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,600
so

224
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,850
this is impossible for switches this
can't even happen

225
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,199
even briefly handles down the whole
network and

226
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,949
if you read the manuals for switches
this is the thing that I hate about the

227
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:36,329
most as they keep saying

228
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,619
if you make this configuration it could
cause a storm

229
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:42,779
some bug because a storm

230
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,939
and there's like a dozen things that you
need to not do if

231
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:50,238
you don't want to have a storm I'm its
like maybe the storm isn't my fault

232
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:51,410
anymore maybe

233
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:58,410
this is non a good way to do things
people runs which is without storms all

234
00:16:58,429 --> 00:16:59,119
the time but

235
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:03,729
the point of our SEP is to break one of
these links

236
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:07,240
if you break this one

237
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,829
then a can be for then you have the same
diagram

238
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,720
that I had over here marxist one link to
an ex

239
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,480
and there's no more storm is no loops in

240
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,470
two parties which is sorry for her for
in

241
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,350
so thing can you talk about

242
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,490
the difference between 83 in the graph

243
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,779
who and these need to talk about that
had some early prime I wanna hear it

244
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:36,379
again

245
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:39,600
somebody yeah okay

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,600
so a tree is something that doesn't have
any looks

247
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:50,850
threes in computer science for down

248
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:57,850
mister like unforced so

249
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,110
3 can have has a no snow ancestry

250
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,720
you know litres parents and children has
a direction that grows in

251
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,510
and that's enough to prevent it from
happening loops

252
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,769
and you can have as many children or as
few children as you like

253
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,210
graph can have

254
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,960
anything connected to anything else and
there's

255
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,960
yeah directed graphs for Zara here

256
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,500
directed graphs it's just edges so

257
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,860
in general the way this is going up and
down is switches

258
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,820
need to have a tree and the Tulare to
running for rickles can deal with graphs

259
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,950
so

260
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,690
think we'll start with is

261
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:48,940
what implications as I have

262
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,279
for after more outing

263
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:59,279
or even just same routing is that the
tree graph thing that makes sense

264
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,320
aka so if you have

265
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,428
the San Francisco office

266
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:14,429
LA office

267
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,910
and the New York office and obviously

268
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,950
going further heists bridge priority on
the New York office

269
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:30,550
so you have all these connected

270
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,669
and RSTP through algorithm now

271
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,250
hopefully explain later fun using up too
much time

272
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,940
world turn this link of to stop the

273
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,710
storm from happening so now

274
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:50,340
whenever LA wants to communicate with
San Francisco have to

275
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:54,030
go through York and I'm

276
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,030
takes about as long as going to Germany
it's about

277
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,440
on 50 to 100 milliseconds hours

278
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,050
within California be more like 10 or
seconds and

279
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,520
and that's enough to be annoying but

280
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,490
if you want to use Lt switching on your
when

281
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,760
than you have to do something like this
so I'm

282
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,710
people will try to maybe remove the
highest praise for retail

283
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,730
or something like this 3 thats

284
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:30,370
you know clearly unacceptable well
because they always gonna go down and

285
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,480
then this one's gonna takeovers and

286
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,640
its so that make sense right if you had
l3

287
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,360
fidel 3 routing than I and you could
deal with a graph

288
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:47,380
than these packets to go through direct
there would be no more need to turn this

289
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,190
link of

290
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,750
so case for

291
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,990
I so this next example

292
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,990
this is where I work part-time for the
presentation

293
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,270
I didn't explain this

294
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,660
by the purpose RSTP

295
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,780
is to turn links of to eliminate

296
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,970
cycles in the graph and make it into a
tree

297
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:18,080
sorted here so I'm accomplished

298
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,230
slightly more complicated shape

299
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,560
in

300
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,290
so everything that has any kind of a
line at all

301
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,720
no matter what kinda extra mark like an
axe or a dime these

302
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,230
are links that you've purchased from the
telephone company here

303
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,430
run along the floor whatever

304
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,530
and 1 I'm gonna walk through is

305
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,700
I'm RSTP in this diagram

306
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,720
has turned off this link to remove this
cycle

307
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,820
because this is this is a new york
switch so

308
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,550
it's the head of 3 established has
decided to turn off a slick

309
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:04,700
what happens as for some reason

310
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,880
back or breaks this link and

311
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,330
network is no longer connected so are
sticky needs to turn links

312
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:17,110
on an off to restore complete an
activity but still not have any cycles

313
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,390
NEC do this in a way that there are no
cycles generated

314
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:27,370
even briefly because if there are the
storm so our city is going to converge

315
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,270
to the strip

316
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:35,270
through five steps

317
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:44,299
I get enough to conquer going on with
the five steps

318
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:09,860
stings nice in so

319
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:16,860
we're starting out with to see if that I
drawn the first card

320
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:27,580
so this is a working link that's been
turned off by RCP

321
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:33,168
and this is a link this conaway RSTP
will send

322
00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:36,679
proposal

323
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:41,429
hope I get this right I'm

324
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,639
know at least be close to rate this
number

325
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:52,639
this no not yet

326
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,279
right I don't have excellent notes on
the TCN

327
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,179
but as what he's talking about

328
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:05,580
is was my first

329
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,580
when you make this change is going to be
learned

330
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,899
source addresses in the

331
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:19,029
them can the content excess or

332
00:24:19,029 --> 00:24:22,730
content addressable memory the routing
table

333
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,330
next to all the sports in the switches
will have learned information about how

334
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,330
to read stations testes which is

335
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,908
when you change the topology and
eliminate this link

336
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,049
that information isn't valid anymore

337
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:39,330
because for example

338
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,689
this switch

339
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:47,580
here if it was just to reach station
attached to the switch

340
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,590
now needs to go this way before went
this way

341
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,029
so in the process in doing RCP

342
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:58,289
there are TC and messages broadcast
throughout all the switches that cause

343
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,669
in two floss their

344
00:24:59,669 --> 00:25:03,860
learned station address information

345
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,220
and then just for the packets all over
again relearn

346
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,419
it forces all the information on a port

347
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:16,740
at once when I'm trying to stroll
through is

348
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,429
how it decides to turn this link back on
so

349
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,010
and it has to do this without making any

350
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,529
brief loops in the graph so it starts
with a proposal here

351
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,639
and this week's

352
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:38,269
transmits the proposal to this one and
then this works

353
00:25:38,269 --> 00:25:43,250
would like to agree to this proposal
before can do that it has to turn off

354
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,210
these two links

355
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,029
these two links are not ultimately going
to be turned off by

356
00:25:48,029 --> 00:25:51,919
during the convergence there temporarily
disable just like this one

357
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,320
so this is stuff too and then

358
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,320
once this is done switch sends an
agreement I'm

359
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,820
yes

360
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:13,820
keep on-screen month

361
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:42,000
so this link no longer exists you leave
it blank

362
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
these links have just been disabled
disabled links are still allowed to send

363
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,700
RCP stuff following solace and RSTP

364
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,620
says the actual data packets that they
don't send so

365
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,059
the switch schools and to

366
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:07,450
views please disable everything
proposals and the switches

367
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,280
you don't do anything

368
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,570
they don't have any downstream links to
disable

369
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:23,570
so immediately agree this make sense so
far

370
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,690
so after the agreement the link is
turned back on

371
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,879
in a slightly better diagram I would so
which

372
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,809
these two switches disabling the link
because it's not the link itself

373
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:52,840
assailed

374
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,230
one of the sweetest turns off at its
Port they don't both Turner for me want

375
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:56,610
us

376
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,870
but it's not important to get a feel for
the Army in and

377
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:07,870
so

378
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,929
the proposal goes this way something is
broken

379
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:18,929
agrees

380
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:40,150
repeat the same thing on this link

381
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,330
man after the agreements this western
going back on

382
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:13,050
and

383
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:17,879
I don't remember where it easy answer
sent percent before after during

384
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,920
isomers and during mind there's a

385
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:26,830
it's not always necessary for

386
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,540
TCN to clear

387
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,850
every bit have learned information in
the whole network I'm

388
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,930
usually ends up clearing more
information than it needs to

389
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,720
in theory just because for Oracle dozen

390
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,370
weaver way for the switches to know how
little they need to clear

391
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:53,370
now the switches have a complete picture
overall network are so you guys

392
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,060
understand our city sorter

393
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:03,060
so

394
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,750
you can see other combination our city
in the following morning

395
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,700
I will route around he's failed links

396
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,810
and it will and dynamically learn the
locations of all stations

397
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:20,280
and those are the two things all is
proposing to do

398
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,310
before I go on I think I need a

399
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:31,310
because and backgrounds on hardware
routers as opposed to UNIX writers

400
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,480
says some slightly different terms yeah

401
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:53,070
on our PT if it's not discuss anyway

402
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:56,970
I'm if the basically how

403
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,610
when think is broken if that link for to
come back on or something

404
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,630
how does RSTP then stop it from forming
a loop when it's free

405
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,799
gaining the links for the

406
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,990
first one recognized proposals chain or
something

407
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:18,610
the the

408
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:23,350
Mac status the mean it's not even the
Mac

409
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:27,700
I'm acting see the where one or the max
now the conflict the green lights

410
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,390
I can do it in a car feeds into

411
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,570
switches control playing way decides all
the stuff

412
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:41,370
and if you have an expensive so it's
like a Cisco

413
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,539
doesn't implement

414
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:48,770
are sticky because it's too expensive
you can't afford a new one that doesn't

415
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:49,700
men are sticky

416
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,120
then you'll notice the ports go orange
for about 30 seconds

417
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,240
when you first when

418
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,490
when that's link-state light transitions
from dark

419
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,659
to green the port doesn't come up in a
foreign state

420
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:06,940
comes up in a block state and

421
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,150
this which has to operate through this
whole proposal agreement thing for

422
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,270
alternate link back on

423
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,629
so I would be

424
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,960
yeah I in the cards

425
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,220
the axe was a broken link

426
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,250
and dashed lines is a working link
that's blocked so the lights in the

427
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,200
green on this link

428
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,200
but it would stay blocked so and have a
good example for links coming back up

429
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,669
it was a bitter struggle to make this
morning might not be completely right by

430
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,830
it goes through a similar process have

431
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,120
on this link comes back up if it's a
better path

432
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,870
then the switch here

433
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,260
well now a better path to the roots
which so it will send

434
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,640
a proposal to the switch and the switch
will turn off this link

435
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,900
and then it will agree and bring up this
link

436
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:09,900
so it's it's something like

437
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:17,040
armed to I'm 3 and

438
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:29,470
while priority or

439
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,429
yes I am so dry it is is more confusing
was confusing

440
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:38,730
I'm

441
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,419
and

442
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:46,789
anyway all switches even pre RSTP
switches

443
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:50,169
bring freshly connected links up blocked

444
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:53,960
and then transition 360 machine for the
star-forming and

445
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,309
you can for them a few have

446
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:05,309
I'm

447
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,390
I'm

448
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,500
if you have the setup and you

449
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,550
had disconnection this will actually
screw them

450
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:31,370
its document and they tell you don't do
this will cost or cuz

451
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,549
they can't watch the links they come out
they don't know when this home has been

452
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,140
connected

453
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:39,159
and in God willing once it's connected

454
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,279
they will be able to see each other's
packets through the storm

455
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,090
and will eventually learn to turn off
whichever one of these

456
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,550
hands least favorable path to the roots
which and the storm a land

457
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,350
hopefully I'm and how expensive your
switches are

458
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,380
I I've never tried it but it is I'm

459
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,180
explicitly warned against in the
documentation that is a

460
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,210
me more for are

461
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:09,410
a more questions on

462
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:16,410
the index cards

463
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,180
are no

464
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,720
no one has ever told me about anything
like that

465
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,660
special enough publicly a

466
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,710
the

467
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,270
you can set and VMware with the months
have

468
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:41,380
the end zone anything and no one person
and try to do that I don't think it

469
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,100
works very well

470
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,799
I'm so

471
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,180
I commercial running times people with
your ex writers usually think that

472
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,970
routing means forwarding packets

473
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,390
by this is a difficult term because

474
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:03,390
I'm railroaders have

475
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,089
the ports are in

476
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:20,040
line cards

477
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,670
and then there's some kind of boss that
all these are connected to

478
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:27,230
inside the router and then they have

479
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:31,440
you know they have membranes in here
it's not just a regular season and

480
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:31,890
serves

481
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,660
have some kind smart and then separate
from this

482
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:42,250
there's the control plane which will be
a

483
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,790
really slow and cheap see you with not
very much memory that they charge you a

484
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,730
whole of for

485
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,130
and to control plane will

486
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,560
snoop on this bus a little bit I think

487
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,930
sometimes or acts like another port on
the bus

488
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:02,009
and it will also send

489
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,250
commands

490
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:09,110
to the brains inside to these line cards
so

491
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:12,450
this is forty

492
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:18,700
so if you have a router

493
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,350
and l3 router that has a packet coming
in

494
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:25,509
and use to put this onto the forwarding
plane

495
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,730
and send it out that's not called
routing that's called switching

496
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:34,770
at least according to one's I'm fender
so

497
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:37,850
router doing this is switching

498
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,200
which is very much like what I switched
us what's

499
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,340
so does kinda and trying to say about
these layers meeting a whole lot

500
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:47,640
their routing

501
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,670
is more like what RCP and

502
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:55,260
the learning process do have sending
these commands

503
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,840
into the line cars to tell them where
they need to forward based on

504
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,650
destination

505
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:03,460
so that makes sense

506
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:08,500
send a difference from UNIX so

507
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,230
this and other terms there's carom

508
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:17,500
defeated and their brother where

509
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:24,500
talk for a lawn mower pro what time is
it

510
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:31,180
axle

511
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,649
definitely not more than two hours

512
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,760
so there the cam

513
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,710
or for where to learn this new stuff for
selling inequality cam

514
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,310
I don't know why exactly this

515
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:50,299
is Zameen Par the brains inside the line
card

516
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,360
the control plane

517
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:59,780
fills the cam up with stuff i think im
switches in any possible to fill the

518
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,310
cameras are involved in the control
plane on my server

519
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:07,090
and then maybe when the TCN comes
through the control plane

520
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,990
tells the line cars to flush the cam the

521
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,120
favor is

522
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:23,120
sort of like 30 cam the control plane
keeps

523
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:27,259
insight into a list sort of like that
learned West have

524
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:34,260
destination

525
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:44,069
port next of something of this is like
for

526
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:51,070
123 down I'll say if you wanna REITs

527
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:02,259
this is what these people call the
routing table is

528
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,840
fit and rib

529
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,230
is i Series other routing tables

530
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:15,200
maintained by the protocols and about to
talk about and not all the entries

531
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,050
in the ribs make it into the fifth so

532
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,280
you have multiple running cables running
a once in feed into them

533
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,940
by CafePress for a civil discussion
these are almost collapsed

534
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:33,040
so dynamic routing protocol

535
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,410
well-established fair also be loaded
into the camera teakamp

536
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:43,410
my cars and cause for it to happen this
soak a difference in Munich's make sense

537
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,380
I'm yeah I think that sounds fair my
impression is that

538
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,390
the fair stored inside the control plane

539
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:10,750
isn't normal memory and at least part of
it

540
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,000
will be loaded into special memory in a
line cards that's not regular deer

541
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,870
and that's the camera teacher so

542
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:23,810
when Cisco tells you that they are
process watching a packet then

543
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:27,920
that means it has to go to the control
plane let's look it up in the regular

544
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,490
fare

545
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,770
and then send it by hand over my car
rather

546
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:36,850
ok he said

547
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:43,850
when it's an atty can it's called
hardware switched

548
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:58,369
so I don't have index cards for OSPF

549
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:02,349
by it

550
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:06,510
has some character

551
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:09,630
that that makes it

552
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,180
in harder to make index cards because
it's not

553
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:20,180
synchronous the way then RSTP in for the
morning yes

554
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,170
so reasons 30 SPF runners and feelings
between

555
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,830
over these links several things we
happening at once

556
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,360
there will be sending

557
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:45,170
low packets and then also needs to each
other

558
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:52,170
about once every 10 seconds and

559
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,070
they were all be sending

560
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:02,540
database discovery packets

561
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:08,110
are in is will be called something else
to

562
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,550
this is worse flooded in OSPF so

563
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,650
and the switch network

564
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:17,760
you flood packets when you know
recognize the destination

565
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,070
and or SPF

566
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:29,070
you floyd routing information so as you
know the regular IP network

567
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,440
y'all configured by hand subnets aunties
router

568
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:49,640
and the subnets are flooded over these
links

569
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,390
in the database discovery packets with a
protocol where

570
00:43:53,390 --> 00:44:00,390
models and

571
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,580
so this writer will say have this
attached and the other I will say okay

572
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:17,580
and then this article say

573
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:21,620
and this one says OK so

574
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:25,640
this router will advertise the cement
and destruction

575
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:30,129
misdirection in this all copied in this
direction and they have

576
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:35,320
version numbers to help and I sent to my
service information this

577
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,030
database discovery process is really
complicated I didn't prepare enough to

578
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:40,550
understand

579
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:47,550
greater yeah I into anything with areas
of Honor

580
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:54,660
and so these are the only two kind of
packets

581
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:58,109
actually transmitting and in the third
step what's

582
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,280
again runs not synchronize with these
other two is

583
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,900
the Dijkstra algorithm

584
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:13,580
so

585
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,620
and the

586
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,990
whole packets are sent every 10 seconds
no matter whether

587
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:24,360
the databases come in packs are flowing
or not

588
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,710
and the writers learn about their
neighbors through these packets and

589
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,700
send out a database error tyson's these
routers

590
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,410
the these packets and build within each
router

591
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:43,279
a picture the entire network and because
the packets are flooded

592
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,530
the pics are contained inside his router
is identical

593
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:52,190
so

594
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:59,190
they're all have the same picture
network

595
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,630
and this algorithm run separately on

596
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:09,170
each of these to produce

597
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:16,170
Feb

598
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:28,420
so all OSPF routers have a complete
knowledge

599
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,740
the entire network and the problem that
you can see with this from the

600
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,329
perspective

601
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:40,140
switches is these databases carry
packets are gonna take time to send

602
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,940
and not all the writers gonna happen at
the same time and

603
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,790
because these two processes are
disconnected it

604
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:51,240
it's not true back Dijkstra algorithm
runs

605
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,740
every time a new database is coming back
is seen Iran's periodically

606
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,790
runs until it finishes before runs again

607
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:04,900
and new DD packets could come in while
the algorithm is running

608
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,190
so if there are a lot of changes

609
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:13,069
Feb is always a little bit out-of-date
if there are too many changes that

610
00:47:13,069 --> 00:47:14,050
happen too quickly

611
00:47:14,050 --> 00:47:19,200
it won't work what's is the same its
troops which is because it turns off

612
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:19,950
those links

613
00:47:19,950 --> 00:47:25,440
by the reason that these can be
disconnected

614
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:29,839
it's because layer 3 has an IP to:

615
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,839
so if the film here

616
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,560
is not equal to the fifth here

617
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:43,349
it's possible that a packet could loop
between these two routers

618
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:47,000
by and only live about three times and
then it'll be dropped

619
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,630
so it's normal and layer 3 routing to
have

620
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:56,440
temporary routing loops and the whole
design the %ah grins chains because they

621
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:56,900
have this

622
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:03,900
ittt 0

623
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,150
the other thing that's interesting about
having

624
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:13,660
graph rather than

625
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:19,589
a tree as

626
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:22,760
I'm I think many

627
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:28,460
11 player for example but both

628
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,290
switching and OSPF can to some extent
split packets

629
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:37,330
going from here to here some down this
route and some down this route

630
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:40,750
in switching you have to

631
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,620
configured manually the only way I can
work is

632
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,430
you have two links here

633
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:52,290
and you manually

634
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:56,380
bond these links together into some kind
of channel and

635
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,410
it's not like it sends one bit down one
sound one bit down the other channel

636
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:04,490
as I understand it it uses hash

637
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,640
love destination mac Address so

638
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:11,470
your packet the station

639
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:17,090
a will go over here practices be career
and everybody uses these houses

640
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:20,200
but in OSPF I can send up a decision
here

641
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:27,200
and be over here because it's not a tree
anymore

642
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,700
as possible to

643
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:34,940
balance traffic over more than one hop

644
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:41,940
sentence make sense

645
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:02,130
you ready for this you ask questions
about spf jazz rock and questioned out

646
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,980
question is and databases covery world

647
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,880
or rather a sand of information

648
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,640
to some third-rounder about a subnet
asteroid Mb

649
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,810
and the answer is yes and they have

650
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:38,830
some kinda have synchronous information

651
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,840
acknowledgment information
acknowledgement that

652
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,180
though keep their databases and

653
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:50,859
sink I think they have some leases last
time I spend with Mike

654
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,500
will say I already have the following
elysees

655
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,460
and get a list like two million and the
other and will say I would like numbers

656
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,400
19

657
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:07,400
its 7

658
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,570
the information itself is

659
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,970
it's absolutely flooded by it doesn't

660
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:22,670
s say I have submitted a what it says is

661
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,240
my latest a database has the following
elysees

662
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,160
it has numbers 1 through 50 and it has
seventy

663
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,350
71 and 72 and then I'll say

664
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:37,839
this is my way status in one big packet
and the other no se

665
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,310
have almost all of that except for 15

666
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:45,580
and because you can stick and the other
in packets and because in this whole

667
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,630
acknowledgement thing

668
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,630
it turns out that it doesn't issues and
and

669
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,260
band with

670
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:56,930
so honored you're telling me

671
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:03,930
stop was I could do I got an email from
the speakers

672
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,490
since it was the last talk ago to clean
up

673
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:13,580
was longer are cool you guys can fill
out if

674
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,860
I'm bore you to tears yeah

675
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:23,590
anybody wanna if you wanna go closings
yeah

676
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:27,240
you won't be the first time I was lied
to

677
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:34,240
from on I

678
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,100
so

679
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,030
the the punch line with ISS in five
minutes

680
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:45,110
is all about

681
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:49,030
different way that the oocyte people
address knows

682
00:52:49,030 --> 00:52:54,010
this is my IP is a different address
format so

683
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:00,620
packings scary

684
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:07,620
Ste and these are my notes hours can
draw this out

685
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:25,700
so this is won by wide and this is

686
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:31,660
and bites by and by swyto p and the

687
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:35,118
TAFI I is

688
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,660
I think it's almost always 47 and

689
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:42,259
the AFI implies how big this is

690
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,970
like where this boundary is how big is
an I miss the rest

691
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:49,569
yeah I said

692
00:53:49,569 --> 00:53:56,569
right bigger is a really

693
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:03,019
mmm

694
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:07,309
so this is sort of like something I P

695
00:54:07,309 --> 00:54:13,279
this system field either is equal to or
is derived from the mac address

696
00:54:13,279 --> 00:54:18,309
so every station will have a globally
unique system field at about 6 bytes

697
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:21,849
and

698
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:25,549
the idea I through the whole DSP

699
00:54:25,549 --> 00:54:29,680
is something like your ass an

700
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:36,089
so its unique with and your organization
or within most in your organization

701
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:39,369
this is always the same its constant

702
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:42,809
and then this as your sub that number

703
00:54:42,809 --> 00:54:46,099
but the summit number has a special
meaning and

704
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:52,359
is you can have

705
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:56,578
the same subnet attached to many routers
and

706
00:54:56,579 --> 00:55:03,579
there is since

707
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:18,390
if these are hosts and he's a router's
the address on this thing will be

708
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:24,480
is it exit 46 or 47 the 47

709
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:31,480
yes whatever time area 52 the

710
00:55:33,549 --> 00:55:40,549
I'm

711
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:02,749
fair enough

712
00:56:02,749 --> 00:56:05,059
thanks a lot guys no time for more
questions
