1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,300
relations with companies leaves
judgments

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,720
lawsuits criminal records just goes on
and on one database

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,248
so and where they get that is a call
about it known information such as

4
00:00:11,249 --> 00:00:14,969
newspaper subscriptions magazine
utilities

5
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:19,040
almost so yes the PI has access but
unfortunately were

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,680
scrutinized something that's good I

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,509
I was with her if you guys like comment
on how you see

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,360
technologies specifically position
friction

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,329
which here with you see impacting your

10
00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:38,780
business in the next 10

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,059
15 years ago I didn't know how to spell
computer now I can't live without one

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:48,559
same self 21st century cell phone you
know

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,989
basically the PI industry there's people
that specialize in nothing but

14
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,319
background investigations and there's
people that do

15
00:00:55,319 --> 00:00:58,429
nothing but to spouses neck kinda stuff
and so

16
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:01,789
is a what it is that you did

17
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:04,879
just about any investigation would you
do if I wanna do surveillance

18
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,950
I gotta know where the guy is or five
gotta an address when I got it was a

19
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:09,460
good

20
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,299
so you gotta do certain investigative
techniques to find

21
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,840
you know the truth that we've said
office you know

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,130
case we have our CEO of a major company
get it was getting

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,899
email sent to him very you know

24
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:29,020
harsh incriminating threatening et
cetera et cetera we

25
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,640
backtracked email to computer

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,060
their poor so we could tell where
computer was exactly which

27
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,810
which computer was but again it's a
public location

28
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,630
so weather allows surveillance cameras
and the suspect was

29
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,048
in that terminal fortunately we couldn't
prove it he was one that sent from a

30
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,549
public timeline also

31
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,189
encryption is gonna impact is based on
the fact everything that we do

32
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:56,679
revolves around not most what we do
balls around

33
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,999
sometime generated computer with
searches

34
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:04,710
were checking somebody whatever it is so
encryption is def

35
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,030
stand in our way you know in the
government's intentionally trying to

36
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,280
set tighter parameters on the PI

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,730
I some I do love a intellectual property

38
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,730
and encryption is a and has

39
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,780
che's we deal with it intellectual
property

40
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,840
every drug everybody's drug companies

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,040
have thereof their laptop computers
which the issues everywhere their

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,859
salespeople

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,870
encrypt they don't want anybody getting
all these things and find that the whole

44
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,510
sales

45
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,649
how they distribute their

46
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,159
products and things like that so I think
it's good

47
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,159
more by encryption more get
sophisticated the more the body uses

48
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,470
days

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,870
also want to know if you can make any
guesses as to what the president

50
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,230
research military

51
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:04,230
of

52
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:12,610
on

53
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,939
first things first mister

54
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,209
yes on what type surveillance use

55
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:24,510
just electronic video we all types
surveillance video

56
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,609
we have time with GPS on vehicles

57
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,430
stuff legal ramifications you can and
cannot GPS on

58
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,470
that edgewood necessarily tell you

59
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,700
where the person drive point case we
follow somebody five different times

60
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,400
Walmart store finally figured out there

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,400
back person we do physical surveillance
just just

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,298
body type electronic

63
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,569
so we also do countermeasure so we do a
lot of finding

64
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:06,000
bugs and things do

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,590
physically in terms of physical

66
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:16,500
surveillance or this would happen if
course but if someone thought they were

67
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,070
being

68
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,978
follow what are their legal rights in
terms

69
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:24,090
tried this resisting arrest

70
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,539
were if they thought the person's
potential pretended

71
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,849
think that those things well first thing
you need to do

72
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,000
united to make taken legal action
against the persons got a document with

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,100
a law enforcement unity three separate
times so that it can be

74
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,820
considered harassment and/or stocking so
you reported

75
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,479
you know I have followed people that
have been professionals

76
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,630
and as a point case

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,159
got turned around come right back at me
and

78
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,759
got back on him let me down a cul-de-sac

79
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,930
fortune call the second get things like
that so if you think you can follow

80
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,500
do things turn around and drive we go
back at the person get license plates

81
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,800
you know course we also have people
walking you know

82
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,470
here's a list 300 license plates and I
think I'm being followed

83
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,910
where you could drive to the nearest
police station

84
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,720
what color shoes do you wear when you
physically people I

85
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,490
thank you

86
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,009
I just have a polygraph experience to
share pre-employment

87
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,169
actually it was optional decided to take
just

88
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,448
for the experience because I've never
taken it s like that

89
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,840
and I like mass of on the thing

90
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,430
just just for fun because idk about the
job too much and I was honest about

91
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,840
other stuff as well

92
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,199
but and also just stuff that I should

93
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,280
about my head arsons to

94
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,780
but I guess even apply to

95
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,340
now that's the the big point on they did
me

96
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,850
is FBI still here the FBI stone

97
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,000
life was it was optional was it for a
private concert

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,440
up private being company in private area

99
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,570
yeah yes yeah it was a private company
so you know

100
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:26,230
it's only as good as the salmon it s
Fred yeah

101
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,190
you really have to have some lose you
know you lose mad

102
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,800
right and also actually I think it I
didn't say that I've got away it flies

103
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,680
maybe ma I just don't think that they
look at the results I don't

104
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,610
you know I don't know the situation I
think you have to take

105
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,780
take tix is

106
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,600
thanks

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,760
maybe a couple questions

108
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,409
subject you guys are doing

109
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:03,410
for stuff somebody militias still

110
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,659
site K they can still come company
property

111
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,680
or intellectual property you can find
out stuff about

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,800
you guys can find out stuff but
companies and persons be

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
real value in terms of corporate
intelligence

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,919
well you also into corporate
intelligence

115
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,498
the market's with this aspect of our
business call competitive intelligence

116
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:29,689
sorry and that that works through a base

117
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:34,039
you start with their company website you
get information from the company website

118
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:34,520
just

119
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,250
or Google you take that take the prince
was the company in Google

120
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,740
I i think is a lot more information and
then using the databases we have

121
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,620
available to us

122
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,060
get a lot more so I mean you can't do a
lot

123
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,900
live love investigation

124
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,000
just by starting with the company
website going through their principles

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,419
there

126
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,609
directorships you Google the people

127
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,089
for people who have go databases we do

128
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:06,710
it's a good start right there yep for
those on that basis we have you can

129
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,379
accumulate a lot information very
quickly with from his point of view

130
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:15,560
insecurity we have things like that with
penetration testing

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,589
we make a security policy

132
00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:22,419
risk analysis and we try to figure out
what kinda risks

133
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,930
involved with running the company its
gonna cost as the US cuz you know

134
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,469
occurring what you guys are doing I
never see

135
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,250
in stables and is a workers fibrosis
estimates and

136
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,640
other physical securities professionals

137
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,458
we do risky said facilities

138
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,360
alarm systems whatever so we

139
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,890
we do that do that kind of stuff we also
tried to defeated so the

140
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,130
I know it's there was a couple close in
your book to his couple places in

141
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:53,839
defeating

142
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,630
different aspects alarm systems and
certainly that can be done

143
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,279
that's why we try to integrate seven
eight nine ten different

144
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,519
Texas systems in ones for facility isn't
trying to sing iraq

145
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,760
is computer security have firewalls an
IDS is in you have

146
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:15,949
a lot reactive things like bucks weeks
but we also have pro-active things

147
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:19,089
West gonna get this rhetoric wickets or

148
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,459
here's the problem you guys are talking
about electronics love comes back

149
00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:25,120
something simple as dumpster diving I'm
if we're gonna go

150
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,899
for the dig up Stefan company you know
their trash is

151
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,959
the best places to do it you know you
can be something as simple as that

152
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,470
not not all the high-tech could you give
some indications of pro-active things

153
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,880
companies could do

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,140
to prevent you guys from you know going
around

155
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,800
finding all the information one thing is
to educate employees

156
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,079
to prevent just what colleges mention
dumpster diving

157
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,410
because with all the to high tech stuff
out there everybody is worried about

158
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,640
computer security

159
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,390
so you coming up with new virus
protections new farrell's

160
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,470
you name it in their building in the
meantime

161
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,290
the employees are just wrong paper in
the trash

162
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,760
with social security numbers on all
sorts of other

163
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,010
good information somebody's trash taken
away

164
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,470
leaf through we messes with the biggest
that they've things that we try to

165
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,029
educate employees

166
00:10:19,029 --> 00:10:22,380
is a loose lips sink ships

167
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,630
you know Silicon Valley back in eighties
and nineties

168
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,779
said major now folks ago what they would
do is

169
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,810
bars restaurants

170
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,290
we're hiring MIT right the waiters

171
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,760
wages barging guess what they

172
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,490
they fed a lot of good stuff because
they can understand would you be we'll

173
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,100
talk about

174
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,730
the bisbee we see that the Boise we work
hula

175
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,819
and guess what those bartenders
waitresses understood

176
00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:00,019
what they were talking about and route

177
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:05,600
routed these companies rip them off from
that experience

178
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,779
companies study Fig we gotta stop taking

179
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:12,560
intellectual property that's done by
education and that's

180
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,540
not in the workplace with you know

181
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,920
wrote a piece paper away it's keeping
your mouth shut with you out to dinner

182
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,939
when you're out socialize oftentimes

183
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:28,360
competitors was socialize and

184
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,370
these is love big companies like big
jobs but guess what

185
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,559
those jobs stay with a small group of
people and they talk

186
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,459
whatever also a lot of people that they
know the switches competitor

187
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,309
so they kind information

188
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:49,680
download time we were instrumental in a
case

189
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,959
our client 1 230 million dollars because

190
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:57,430
that the other side bar on a contract

191
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,970
we did dumpster email

192
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,689
wanted question

193
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:08,399
shredders you know trash to protect your
physical security

194
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,069
much to your electronic

195
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:15,800
think

196
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,949
below the sequester these phones i say
like to stop

197
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,130
free Steve her

198
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:30,130
Christie

199
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:35,569
said the last conference we saw seems

200
00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:39,279
is that it was tremendously easy and it
sounded like become

201
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,300
easier to get access to information is
us

202
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,899
individuals just some website it sounds
like

203
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:51,339
some things are getting easier I'd like
to know what

204
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:54,410
has changed in the last two years since
see

205
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,920
spoke to us about privacy in the States
the government has been held in a lot

206
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,350
more congressional hearings in other
words they just finished

207
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,689
large investigation related to those
companies that have been

208
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:09,379
buying and selling cell phone records
wall

209
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:14,139
has passed is passing related to making
it a federal crime

210
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:17,139
being able to

211
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,779
being able to block the source social
security numbers

212
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,220
lotta love the database we have access
to

213
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,420
they now have to do on site inspections
before

214
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,959
signed up so is

215
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,189
gone new level government decided

216
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,899
our privacy is something that they want
and they are

217
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,439
forcing physically making demands on the
on

218
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:46,269
information brokers we call to make it
more difficult

219
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,269
to a point where you know I was in the
process of putting together database

220
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,630
myself and I said you know

221
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,970
I'd so you know unless you already in it
not a real

222
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,130
incentive to join in if

223
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:04,380
we getting tighter information is gonna
be there because it is there

224
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,649
I'm dealing with a case right now

225
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:13,459
were court in one particular state
throughout

226
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:16,550
seven years a court records we just
happened

227
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,839
catch their got those records

228
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,930
so again gonna throw stuff

229
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,130
stuff out you know they're gonna it's
gonna come up on some somewhere

230
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,220
people you know from privacy issue I
don't I don't want all my stuff out

231
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,629
there

232
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:38,309
and so i i ask this one actually
arguments that look

233
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,309
when you go to you know Home Show

234
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,569
or guard Joe whatever ever fill out
those

235
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:48,220
when a sweepstake she says it all the
time

236
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,809
what number she said myself what do you
think's going on a date

237
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,059
markings goes on it's got

238
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:03,059
happen gonna happen limit so would you
say that the five hundred pages

239
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,040
information from easier to get

240
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,179
two years rip me like Rick tell you cuz

241
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,660
you know record with those guys it
there's a lot out there on

242
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,880
I can't imagine why looking so

243
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,389
so when I I volunteer to

244
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,670
do this I heard Steve on a of gas and I
emailed him

245
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:33,309
on a Sunday night at listen to the
listen mp3 Sunday night email

246
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,719

251
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:53,100
and so

252
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,309
forty-five minutes later when I got in
my cell phone rang as I was pulling in

253
00:15:57,309 --> 00:15:58,429

255
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,339
to sign the email and I see in my email
address

256
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,380
you know every word ever lived

257
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,670
you know what kinda car was driving was
looking inside lifers my house

258
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,240
he he knew somebody else in Alabama

259
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,750
using my social security number since
1983 when I was like 11

260
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:27,959
he knew my friend in any only I talked
to him briefly today before

261
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:30,990
you get arrested and he showed me

262
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,069
yet this 500 pages stop that he had

263
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:39,240
on me and I'm a semi public figure so
they sorta more out about me

264
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,029
that there might be about other people
but just cuz I've done

265
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,730
I worked on mostly designed again
considered heroes and I have work

266
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,279
column so there's a lot of but he knew

267
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,510
a ton of stuff and he found all my
friends

268
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,600
and he knew like you found pictures on
my friends and the fact I look like

269
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,419
other people

270
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:05,089
knew about my brothers criminal history
like just an amazing by 7i was on for

271
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,648
half hour

272
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,949
you know that's all he spent so

273
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:11,959
I would say that if your RT in

274
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,790
with the database companies that it's
still pretty easy to find out ship

275
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:23,369
thanks very much a lot of this is public
information meeting good

276
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,829
everything else but any good

277
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,590
can pull that kinda stuff because it's
out there these databases that you

278
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,270
mention

279
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,889
PI's have restricted access to you

280
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:43,889
who how many are there and who controls
these

281
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,630
there are there were a multitude every
state

282
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,780
as a computer access to certain records

283
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,799
I just did something yesterday Colorado
which is wide open except for probate

284
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,000
jew

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,179
you get and get a court case I

286
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:05,350
it very soon state to state what you get
from state

287
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,158
access computers we have the databases
we have

288
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:15,399
or a conglomeration guess

289
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,510
different bit different people would
have access to different things they got

290
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,559
bought up by other entities

291
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,730
now they have one conglomerate things
you get is one source we get a pretty

292
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,220
good picture let's go

293
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,540
I did that last week on an individual I
gave it to Steve

294
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:34,570
because he is a totally different
database came up with almost exactly the

295
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,120
same information came

296
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:39,399
when I think wanted to more dresses and

297
00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:42,580
that's why I when I I do database
searches

298
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,850
me it's just a place to start

299
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,610
because its gonna tell you their former
dresses you know the dates

300
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,299
for its some like in his

301
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,860
this case a relatives possibly

302
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,530
former neighbors place you live
sometimes

303
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:05,230
have jobs in the air any publications
that you may have read

304
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,840
will be be mentioned excess review

305
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,939
your book no Google made as a you my
book

306
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,340
I so these is so many different
databases are available there's no one

307
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,639
source

308
00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:23,250
that I would trust and uses gospel
because is always more

309
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,899
sowed in in for example this one woman I
did this week she

310
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:31,770
live in seven different states so not
only do I I take that database

311
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,570
information

312
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,760
I call somebody the PI in that state

313
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,270
and say what can you get in your state
that is not going to be a this

314
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,110
me database paper like subscription
reach these databases

315
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,710
white you called somebody from state
just

316
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,770
its because I don't pay for that were
houses delivered okay right

317
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,549
I would have ability to get that source
why wouldn't have any

318
00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,370
I don't do a lot investigations and
Colorado we do work out there

319
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,350
you know i'd maybe a dozen cases your
idea but it doesn't pay for me to

320
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,440
to subscribe for that many cases

321
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,030
what you have there's a about ten major
players in

322
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:14,730
that industry they have other web sites
and other companies

323
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,360
subsidiaries so love information

324
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,610
the same which which ones

325
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,419
one just market

326
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:31,309
do you know any good which is why local

327
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:35,830
is an unconfirmed source you get off
databases

328
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,220
unconfirmed sources physically to
interview some

329
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:47,220
go through the process verified thank
you

330
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,970
couple questions coming from a computer
forensic

331
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,299
network intrusions I was wondering role

332
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:58,649
different some assiduously

333
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:02,000

334
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,879
yes p

335
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:09,460
question curiously research

336
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,600
if you're doing week profile

337
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,270

say you could find out just about

341
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,179
anything you want about that person

Justin Beiber high-profile case out the
Hamptons I've

343

to be done he's had finish cook

346
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,270
cooked I me so always computers we have
to

347
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:55,000
okay so so there it is so forensic
examination

348
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,780
heart 5 sort so what I was curious

349

spouse spouse there me say okay you can

352
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,020
look at this computer

353
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,110
it varies from state to state and

354
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:23,780
I won't do anything without checking
with my computer forensics guy

355
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,860
should know statewide that particular
state

356
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:30,220
and run the best the attorney

357
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,250
I'm not going to do anything that's
going to jeopardize case

358
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,369
never attorney says to me it's okay

359
00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:40,700
the wife page to the computer okay way

360
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,840

he's representing the client at that
point me

362

because I want to break it was a tall I
always tell my wanna break any laws

363
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,480
by doing this is it legal in this state
wherever

364
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,080
a you know we haven't had a problem with
their situation

365
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,490
just

366
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,330
would would you wanna know about that

367
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,260
pride fine group fine

368
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,070
speeches me

369
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:24,050
does a really good I just started

370
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,809
matter fact Associated the Western
defence studies institute

371
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,490
role and I'm gonna be building a
database for them

372
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,669
what it's gonna now consist of basically

373
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:40,020
I'm gonna be writing profiles every
known or suspected terrorist in the

374
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,950
world

375
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,350
and I've got enough information

376
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,639
I have enough information at home

377
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:56,639
about sixty CDs worth information on
terrorism

378
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,760
now but I've I have to I have to do one
on several people with the same last

379
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,340
name as me

380
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,970
the northern myself five years

381
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,830
there's a lot of Kenyans their chief
staff Republican Army in 1998 was Brian

382
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,510
keen

383
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,690
so as about that

384
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,669
I always try to get to the airport real
early

385
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:28,330
thank you

386
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,149
I've got a bunch a question Obama to
restrict myself to one because

387
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:37,330
I think that's fair I want to know is
there a a a formal could've

388
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,600
ethics for private investigators with
that

389
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,889
administered by licensing body year
Trade Organization

390
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,280
and I'd like to ask I each one of you
individually

391
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,220
to come up perhaps with one instanceof
the case

392
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,990
have refused on ethical grounds or if
not maybe a scenario

393
00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:00,169
where you would refuse it on ethical
grounds

394
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:05,260
that's fair well i cant

395
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,760
one that I've shared my seminar today
where I should have refused

396
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,389
and happen to be an individual walked in
my office and said look

397
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:17,240
my wife job work yesterday

398
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,409
and supposed work she didn't do it got a
ride home when I got home I

399
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:25,720
furniture was gone my two-year-old was
gone and

400
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,190
I don't care she was leaving
two-year-old so

401
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,119
I interview this guy for an hour trying
to provoke him China

402
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,809
the violent type eventually I'll take
your case

403
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,629
he thought that she was staying with a
sister

404
00:25:40,629 --> 00:25:43,830
neighboring town and gave me the name
sister fortunately

405
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:46,980
you gave me the wrong name sister we
started database searches

406
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,510
did finder the next day I walk into my
house

407
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,559
his mug shot on on the screen here found

408
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,590
his wife mother held her hostage shot
execution-style

409
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,720
she went over two sisters are and

410
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,330
in her purse was some information about
a story in the town where they're

411
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,010
actually

412
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:12,010
located he broke into the storage in
found address at the apartment complex

413
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,379
with stake the form a complex out the
next morning wife came out with a

414
00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:16,520
two-year-old

415
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,530
she saw him freaked out shot at yes

416
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,928
shop hit her in the head killer scooped
up the to you

417
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,080
took off about three days later

418
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,730
they got a suspicious person call it a
backup Washington

419
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:33,899
what stay police around shot and killed
himself with the two-year-old

420
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:37,520
the car next so you know yeah

421
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,549
might be kinda a just a happenstance

422
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:44,840
no I mean but that leading me to my
question is i mean

423
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,290
is there identifiable factors that would
cause you to turn down

424
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,809
a case on ethics and if if you can point
to a

425
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,678
real case maybe scenario think

426
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,220
if if you'd like

427
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,600
well in my case it's pretty short sweet
because

428
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,090
technically speaking are were bound

429
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:10,290
I'm bound by the same sort of ethics you
know but

430
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:14,168
we also can run I can also run into a
similar situation

431
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,379
is Kelly but the base main things that I
do

432
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:21,580
they are all legal except I have been
assed

433
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,010
to get the character discharge of people
more than once

434
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:31,879
now i cant do it but it's illegal the

435
00:27:31,879 --> 00:27:35,750
because this the government in 1979 any

436
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,859
that anybody being separated from any
branch of the armed services from 1979

437
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,859
to the present day

438
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:45,609
there character discharge is not public
record

439
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:48,609
therefore unless they sign a waiver

440
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:52,600
granting you access to that information
you can't get it

441
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,940
and order to get it you have to go do it
basically

442
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:01,669
illegally which means you have to be in
collusion with the federal employees

443
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:06,389
you'll both be hung out to dry court
because

444
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:13,389
for my part to answer questions about
ethics

445
00:28:15,379 --> 00:28:18,950
there again are several different
discharge have honorable

446
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,149
bad conduct discharge dishonorable

447
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:26,690
administrative and within all of them

448
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,030
you have certain levels need to the
service medical

449
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:35,350
whole bunch of other words whole lotta
listed

450
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:39,379
what they call reenlistment and
separation codes that they use

451
00:28:39,379 --> 00:28:43,480
when somebody gets outta service1
discharge now they're not available to

452
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,190
the public

453
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:47,570
more but I have to get my hands on the
last one that was made available to the

454
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,609
public

455
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:52,619
so I can more or less breakdown these
codes that'll tell you just why that

456
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,260
person was discharged but I'll

457
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,379
have those clothes before

458
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:04,059
get back to you ethics question last
count

459
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:09,780
111 this thing its on my associations
with a burlesque

460
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,510
less we cover members 23 different trade
associations

461
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:16,970
they all have a code its and

462
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,030
obviously illegal axes rate to top

463
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,168
and conflict insist is right behind it

464
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:27,790
and you know that there are the things
that won't get involved in that

465
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:33,040
there's often times where I turned down
work people want me to find somebody

466
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,480
you know they want to give me a good
reason why well I'm not going to have

467
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,240
somebody

468
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,399
fight somebody somebody get shot or
killed murder

469
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,510
injured whatever I've been asked to do
all kinds of things

470
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,740
book phones to arrange for somebody's
legs to be broken

471
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,679
yeah or point me in the right direction

472
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,369
yeah I put him in the right direction
out here

473
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:00,470
up I'll get involved in anything it's
illegal

474
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,030
I will get involved in the conflict if I
represent one party is certainly would

475
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,399
represent the other

476
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:09,310
I won't send anybody up people call
real-time to you

477
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,119
range for for women to check out she my
husband is

478
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:20,119
faithful no ido you need a pimp

479
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:23,490
what what we do is investigate as we
verified

480
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,530
white is happening we don't make things
up

481
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,908
all we do is documented what is going on

482
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:33,970
and that's where we're all charges

483
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,740
and most more in most cases state law
dictates

484
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,599
what you can and can't do see if you
read your licensing law from state to

485
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:42,700
state

486
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,389
pretty much tell you that what that
doesn't tell you your own good common

487
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:47,419
sense should tell you

488
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:54,419
for you code about sixty from your
professional associations

489
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:58,849
so i'd a strange experience polygraph
recently

490
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:01,918
the baseline me with a stem test

491
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,740
it work showed up is not lying

492
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,550
ones was

493
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:13,089
and I took the regular test my failed
every single question

494
00:31:13,089 --> 00:31:17,990
except for my name so I wanted to know

495
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:21,310
what can someone do to prevent
false-positive

496
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:25,369
is that a common thing know if the
false-positive rate is so high

497
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:29,419
widely with such a reliance on
polygraphs in the first place

498
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:34,750
well false positives a I just earlier my
presentation

499
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:40,560
there's something called the guild
complex reactor

500
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:45,550
did you met murder john kennedy you know
people react like today

501
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:49,240
and they were born yet so I mean these
people

502
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,200
there are certain people you can test is
about 5 percent the population of the

503
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,869
world you can test

504
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:01,470
a it's for whatever recycle logical
reason they have a physiological reason

505
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,200
war there

506
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,409
there using some sort medication

507
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:10,440
that we can read it shorts and it is a
lot different reasons

508
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,320
but tests to be done ahead a time to see
if their guilt complex reactor and

509
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,570
that's one of the questions that you
kill john kennedy

510
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:19,879
using yes that people were born at 263

511
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:25,830
so noted because nose eyes were wide

512
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:29,310
so but polygraph is nothing more than a
tool

513
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:32,850
it's not an endo that's what brought
polygraph doubt

514
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,080
in the eighties beginning in the
eighties it was

515
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,389
the end-all went from and/or see

516
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,640
by 88 there are some people

517
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,420
source whereby though you said I believe
in polygraph in certain circumstances

518
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
it's very helpful

519
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:54,460
when I have fax again somebody like will
do is we do love employees investigation

520
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,080
so let's say we put a camera

521
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,960
hidden camera when somebody you watch
them stealing yeah I have been Camino

522
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,560
you love you

523
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,389
say look you know this is the deal

524
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,250
you can talk to me you can talk to
offices to do.

525
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,690
here you talk to me and my work at this
will go home

526
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,240
you talk to him you don't home in
handcuffs so you if you tell me the

527
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,780
truth

528
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,740
and i cant verified how I verified it
through polygraph

529
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,670
to the guy says he stole five hundred
dollars with the stuff in the axis till

530
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:27,250
15

531
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,380
else's stuff I'll be able to determine
that after a polygraph exam weary know

532
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,150
he stole

533
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:37,870
so it's just how much and what that does
is verify for the insurance companies

534
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:41,500
so that we can make claim and be fairly
accurate

535
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,810
on how much their losses actually were
so it's it's cool it's not an end-all

536
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:50,429
it's something I use a threat you tell
me to choose five would you

537
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,550
like to volunteer to take part we have
to verify your

538
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,930
veracity for pre-employment screening if
there's no way you can get the job

539
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:01,640
what's that five percent of the
population supposed to do

540
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,400
tell said listen I what the fuck it
before it got all screwed

541
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,980
so you can do i mean is very few

542
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,300
is this is where you have to take a
pre-employment about or

543
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:19,869
so I II work

544
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:25,880
thanks

545
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,250
bean European the you think that the
euro

546
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,590
the can eventually go beyond the border

547
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:37,370
that this these and you to summit

548
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,719
some the also in other countries part of
the conference where

549
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:48,210
there is a spatial specific trouble I
mean

550
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,500
nation were or in chevron's

551
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,980
wheats and in the Keen in the UK and
also in the keys

552
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,730
of and that the not to promote supported
by

553
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:06,160
both government accepting as a poor

554
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,870
private investigator work math those who
do use a

555
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:13,029
and the for a different the quarter

556
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,980
different languages a different the me

557
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,430
we need to access a local derbies

558
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,308
and how do you active for is this an
easily where I come from

559
00:35:24,309 --> 00:35:29,869
I if you had if you the three sons fire
understand right

560
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:34,369
your asking about how American private
investigators would operate

561
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:37,770
in Europe yeah I mean the EF above

562
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,839
the both your own the yet

563
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,700
for instance Europe what they normally
do

564
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,220
these days because because of technology

565
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,130
as they get somebody to get a private
investigator in that country to do

566
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:55,300
you know whatever it is they're gonna do
they don't go over there

567
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,859
themselves anymore like they did 30
years ago they

568
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:03,029
now with all the networking because I'm
in touch with private investigators in

569
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,109
Italy Spain

570
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:08,430
Britain arlen you name it Columbia

571
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,379
I'm in touch with all them myself and I
know these guys are too

572
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,960
so if you have an international
situation

573
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,339
and I see them are posted on these
newsgroups all the time I see I need

574
00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:23,069
help in this country that country

575
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:26,680
looking for a a marriage certificate
from Germany or

576
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:30,299
bank accounts in Italy's something like
that

577
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:34,730
because looking for somebody who skipped
with funds or somebody's

578
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,930
you mister something like that so

579
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,759
they work more or less with
investigators in other countries

580
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,359
American investigator wouldn't
necessarily go to that country himself

581
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,040
feel some

582
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,460
with a call subcontract to European

583
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:55,410
in that particular country who obviously
would be better for the job

584
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:59,118
the Los Nos lately thank you

585
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,380
so for the

586
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,750
in the case over poker game and you
don't have a polygraph

587
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:12,160
machine with you and you're kinda
wondering if a person is bluffing

588
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,210
not do you think there's like their
couple like simple questions that you

589
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:20,030
think might be able in civil responses
you can look for think might be able to

590
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:23,200
to help you figure something like that
out yet when he got here

591
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,150
Raza like sick asking that season

592
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:33,079
great racism 10 and let him call ready
to talk to him about the

593
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,490
Voice analyzers what stress

594
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:41,549
yeah %uh there are some a technologies I
did now which

595
00:37:41,549 --> 00:37:45,390
live on Voice to

596
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:51,900
determine choose from deception I don't
know about the latest round but in the

597
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:55,250
early eighties nineties

598
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:58,770
it is latest 2000 I was involved studies

599
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:02,160
these single forever which is why use

600
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,879
versus polygraph which is cardio

601
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,790
your heart activity like skin response
central nervous system

602
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,509
and do well which is your breathing is 3
for hours a polygraph in only one

603
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,250
invoice

604
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,490
so I have to say my experience is
attested

605
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:24,230
much more accurate results with the
polygraph because this three brothers

606
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,089
all three of these verified they usually
coincide

607
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:33,549
with voice you only have one a so
whether the technologies the

608
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:36,859
the devotees advanced algorithms is
wisdom

609
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:41,960
crap being fed that and I have you guys
would know a lot more about advanced

610
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,640
algorithms that I would

611
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,770
that through that because these advanced
algorithms fed to this

612
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:52,980
that that that you know they come up
well I've tested apollo get tested

613
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,540
people

614
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:58,210
then uses voice Press valuator or it's
that call that now

615
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,630
it something else but uses voice up

616
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,730
it's not as accurate as probably

617
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:07,890
about 10 to 15 points less actors

618
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,578
they do have one more thing coming out
to that up

619
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:14,770
noticing because the counterterrorism
side

620
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,900
line work day are also

621
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,030
experimenting now with eyeball

622
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,540
recognition you wanna call it that reach
the red

623
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,420
all that other stuff just like those you
see those James Bond regional

624
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,200
actually print up you could college has
been around for a long time

625
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,480
there's a room in the I

626
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,480
in Virginia on at CIA headquarters they
caught

627
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,170
the role and in this room there's

628
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,359
a polygraph I fuck wit me now I did
three parameters I mention

629
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:53,589
pupil Pupatello it's that Jerry Mays

630
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:56,970
they also you have it or a she so while

631
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,839
questioning you or will change as you a
question in Houston

632
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,210
gets him they use a also

633
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:12,240
in some cases with a test people

634
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,730
for these sex crimes

635
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,869
and sexual proclivities they use

636
00:40:18,869 --> 00:40:24,380
I think all the Pena up with this
McGrath

637
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,109
and a show a child molesters day

638
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:33,339
put this apparatus somebody forces
apparatus they

639
00:40:33,339 --> 00:40:36,940
and they show them pics you so young
boys or whatever the thing maybe

640
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,599
young boys and girls dogs out and the

641
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,170
they can tell by the amount arousal

642
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:51,299
with this guy's be a good boy never send
them to a penal colony

643
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:55,819
the Kennebec teammates or to the point
where is no question

644
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:58,910
I don't know if you've had time to
investigate a priori have

645
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:02,519
adequate to rely on maybe abilities

646
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,380
somebody was telling the truth
themselves looking

647
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,239
actual so minutes is there a general

648
00:41:11,239 --> 00:41:15,359
for a couple things there yes because
things first

649
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:18,808
tree experienced for situation yeah

650
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:24,609
there is stupid state I'll give an
example the biggest recovery ever had

651
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:25,200
was the

652
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,539
cope with the formula make fiber optics
work

653
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:32,579
it's the because the outside the model
still want to keep things like

654
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:39,539
suspected 1882 was work something like
twenty billion dollar and we had about

655
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:40,759
five suspects

656
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:44,910
so we bring in an interview first thing
you ask him is

657
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,269
I which name it how you my name is
Reggie in

658
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:54,749
nice to see you you steal this formula
yes everyone the same question everybody

659
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:55,499
said note

660
00:41:55,499 --> 00:42:00,099
this one guy says now he says you know
as matter fact I'd ever stolen anything

661
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:01,660
in my whole life

662
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:06,078
I so really he says yes I've never told
a lie either

663
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,970
well was pretty easy case a

664
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:16,680
its wanna make a statement about the
four stress

665
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,089
made want social engineering

666
00:42:20,089 --> 00:42:24,619
we got above an 80 percent detection
rate for social over the telephone

667
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:29,769
by comparing multiple factors mister
shows so sense is that means a good day

668
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:36,769
I

669
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,599
W or sellers interest

670
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:45,910
its engineering anyone

671
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:50,019
for me are you trying to get information

672
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:53,450
said yeah they had just had of Iraq ISI

673
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:57,260
said we gotta control test we have
wonderful people

674
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:01,109
were causing a social engineers 30
individuals

675
00:43:01,109 --> 00:43:06,589
posing as call center the test was about
we

676
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:10,980
random control calls that were normal
calls to police

677
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,730
orders things but and then me other
friends your

678
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,839
Moses years credit cards

679
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,288
his class students posing as the call
center we

680
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:29,640
analyzed audio afterwards about

681
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,200
Steve just got taken away you get credit
card numbers like this

682
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,480
a 0 these were ones that we made up

683
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,900
they were real okay sexy

684
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:43,900
your questions probably over now but

685
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,869
give the along with his life role it was
your masters cases

686
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:51,059
you could bottle it and sell it do it oh
yeah

687
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:57,099
yeah with information who's supposed to
place everybody here we can all

688
00:43:57,099 --> 00:44:03,970
do so said I V I've heard this eighty
percent figure bed around before

689
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:08,589
be seriously ob you know the police

690
00:44:08,589 --> 00:44:11,930
is a testing a facility in rome new york

691
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,240
and the place is a mess around with this
were probably

692
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,589
89 years now and you know they claim
anywhere between

693
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:24,450
1785 I just don't see it and

694
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:29,940
again comment6 three parameters a
polygraph one invoice

695
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,550
we got much more them one Voice do

696
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,180
yeah instead of just taking baseline
stressed

697
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,680
variations and frequency with these
issues have arisen things

698
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,540
I can explain a little more I tried for
sororities

699
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:52,540
back tomorrow is the guy selling walls
downstairs up

700
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,530
this if she gets it you get some the
work like that you'll make a lot

701
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,920
%uh money he knows the problem is that

702
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,200
a you have to do a lot of studies by the
time you get there with the state like I

703
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,550
said

704
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,410
in rome new york did a study in this
this technology def by 10 years

705
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:15,259
some police departments using it problem
is that it's not full

706
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,020
percent is good used

707
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,710
at a wide you get one force lead to
something like this

708
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,230
you of the wild goose chase again I
believe

709
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,630
polygraph I get technology lie detection
technologies

710
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:36,670
school it is not an end-all give you
ideas but the way I use it is to verify

711
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,450
statements I already get

712
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:41,530
the way polygraph examiners do things is
they

713
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,940
interview the person first get them to
commit certain statements

714
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,800
and then verified use the polygraph this
social engineering thing is

715
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,380
is a phone call II doing lie to me today
no

716
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,050
okay that type that's an interview type
deal

717
00:45:57,050 --> 00:46:02,819
that could mislead you in miscue you
into going off into areas you should be

718
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:07,490
or it's not good fruitful so if if was
used like a polygraph

719
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:11,260
may have great value this would be used
like this

720
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:16,920
beware as monitor call center maybe
minor four attackers

721
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,920
ideas if you got if you have one of
these things work

722
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,160
love the test I'll get you would contact

723
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:30,578
sounds great bring it back to you

724
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,760
kinda whole privacy thing for

725
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,140
just the second privacy well how

726
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:42,650
does it change you purse to have access

727
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:45,900
to all that information change

728
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,869
if everybody here had just

729
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:56,020
you do you do you have the bill will get
all the information that we do

730
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,810
scope a4 and it didn't come from one

731
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,849
source we get out one source nicely
package for us

732
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,849
you can go to court records get half the
stuff

733
00:47:05,849 --> 00:47:09,200
is accessible readily accessible

734
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,200
there so think it's just

735
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,319
he said white spread the city people
thinking

736
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:20,550
they can't get by the problem is a civil
there's a lot of bogus information out

737
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:20,829
there

738
00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:24,410
come in my office again 15 sheets on a
guy and

739
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,848
to be about two hours figure out the
only about one page dealt with this

740
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:28,290
subject

741
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,400
so lot of information cross-section

742
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,770
accidentally if you going to buy a car
and the clerk

743
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:40,440
she's do you credit app punches in one
number wrong

744
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,030
somebody else's credit and so it's that
simple

745
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:49,810
thanks before I asked my question

746
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:54,690
I don't wanna sell winer even was
standing directly behind us Gen

747
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:57,750
couldn't hear what he was saying because
there's a lot of people talking

748
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:01,250
back thank you these

749
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:07,079
limit you're talking at any rate more
than one question for each

750
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,140
back a kid

751
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,410
I gave you can speak that

752
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,920
okay is to make people talk back an hour

753
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:22,050
esta own I

754
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:29,020
K thank you

755
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,619
her um in terms of military records

756
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:37,140
what exact not exactly what type
information is

757
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:41,140
in there that makes worth going through
so much trouble to go through all the

758
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,730
people

759
00:48:41,730 --> 00:48:45,180
lots of things I had a PI

760
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,270
contact me from california one time just
a couple months

761
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:52,569
does matter fact he was

762
00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:56,099
the I believe use investigator for the
defense

763
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,170
involved in murder case this guy

764
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:04,849
was a marine just after marines at 75
yards

765
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,319
night without a light one shot he took
somebody on the front seat of a car

766
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:12,549
now they're trying they're trying to say

767
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:16,480
the one side say well he was a trained
killer

768
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,790
yeah I got the other says sample was a
lucky shot so you can get down

769
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,790
policeman's or something well

770
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,819
they wanted to find out so they came to
me I got his record you never had any

771
00:49:27,819 --> 00:49:28,630
formal

772
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,240
he had he had normal marine rifle
training

773
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,140
was not a marksman so they called it a
lucky shot

774
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,009
charge brought down a man so I mean the
guy did you know

775
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,290
because that information he didn't get
lethal injection you got

776
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:49,299
life sentence and I had another one

777
00:49:49,299 --> 00:49:52,380
not quite so bad

778
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:57,130
this one woman this is why I like
busting frauds wannabes

779
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,680
lived in fear her husband for four years

780
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,720
because he kept telling her he was a
Navy SEAL was a trained killer

781
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,510
stuff and she finally got up the nerve
to go to a private investigator

782
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,349
looked into he came to me I checked into
my

783
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:17,410
never serve one day in uniform in any
branch service

784
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,598
so which this guy this woman

785
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:24,960
living in fear for years %uh guy was a
phony

786
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:31,960
so she got the divorce way

787
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,140
let me Stephen the question work other

788
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:43,540
sorts information besides things that up
we would know about things

789
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,109
or with in the military records

790
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:50,560
there's two things about military
records 1 if you have the subject

791
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,750
signature you get a lot of information

792
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,349
personal stuff if you don't have this
information if you don't have a

793
00:50:56,349 --> 00:50:58,490
significance to get information

794
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,589
but it's gonna be with EcoRI that

795
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:04,819
in other words you're only gonna get
military information

796
00:51:04,819 --> 00:51:08,000
get any personal style so

797
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,299
when I submit a request I usually do
letter study using the standard form

798
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:12,920
that the

799
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,359
have I make sure they know it's a
Freedom of Information Act request

800
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:23,369
that way it's handled differently

801
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:26,680
and what I do is I asked them for

802
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,970
all any all releasable information

803
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:33,770
including medals awards citations

804
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:39,859
ribbons military training education

805
00:51:39,859 --> 00:51:43,990
history assignments obviously history
for signs

806
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:47,730
is gonna bury maybe personnel records
school

807
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:52,210
page 3 history assignments other
branches or something else

808
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:56,180
but they all say the same thing literary
career

809
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:01,609
more pages you actually so page 3 can
actually be like in my case for pages

810
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:06,270
twenty years was all over the place
there's two years

811
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,849
so list you entered the service to

812
00:52:09,849 --> 00:52:13,270
hurry day got outta service everything
in between

813
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:16,980
day that you were left one station

814
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:20,190
how many days in between next

815
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:24,339
leave time use sir believe in between

816
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:29,609
transfers will also be listed your
primary duties at those assignments

817
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:32,640
what you did supervisory position

818
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,680
source such-and-such any MLS's

819
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,930
switches military occupational specialty
you find those

820
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:42,210
that's what they call everything the
Navy and the Coast Guard

821
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:46,500
we call them NEC Navy enlisted us
occasions

822
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,900
come out to the same things numbers def

823
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:56,830
and LB list so you can find out all that
stuff you can also find out

824
00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:00,359
prior to nineteen seventy-nine character
discharge

825
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:05,380
after seven reporters see and you can
find all sorts of stuff

826
00:53:05,380 --> 00:53:09,210
what it does it also shows where that
person

827
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,060
enlisted in the military where they got
out

828
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,060
and this can be a good starting point
for investigators

829
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,230
because a lot of people when they get
better service they don't move very far

830
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:21,040
from where he got out

831
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,819
especially retirees because what happens
is

832
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,560
they have what they call twilight towers
you doing twenty years

833
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,540
last tour duty they trying give you what
you want

834
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,869
duty station 1 which means that person's
problem stay in the area once they

835
00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:39,910
retire

836
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:43,560
that's what they did to me this amazing

837
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,640
thank you medical

838
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,690
you can get them but again with only
with the signature otherwise you're not

839
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,180
gonna get

840
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,830
even an acknowledgement that they exist
tighter

841
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,140
doctors

842
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:03,490
even I had to get kids my kids records
were all held by the embassy in London

843
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,690
the Navy clinic there and

844
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:09,770
I had to give special authorization for
a doctor on

845
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:14,740
I'll he had send off to the Navy to have
them shipped over

846
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:18,510
they wouldn't even send them to me the
kids father

847
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:23,640
for further transfer a good director

848
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,250
to questions the first questions doing
anything

849
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,119
with females brain waves for the
polygraph machine

850
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,270
to bring you closer to the stem

851
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:39,150
if you're monitoring hearten eyes polls
and things like that

852
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,490
could there be a way to to bring a
little bit closer to home

853
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:45,609
there's no possibility of

854
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:49,330
there this week friesen well

855
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:53,759
government skin response is measures
central nervous system activity so in

856
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,569
fact that is already

857
00:54:55,569 --> 00:54:59,690
want the parameters what you're talking
about a brainwave activity is one of

858
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,339
those parameters that they have in that

859
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:07,210
row quantico

860
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:13,450
and its place where really nobody wants
to be his

861
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:18,010
because you very busy to take a
polygraph

862
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:22,619
take a few progress I'll recommend

863
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:27,880
the reason I got involved in politics
was the police academy back in 1871

864
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,950
there was a guy from the New Jersey
State Police Academy in there and just

865
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:36,690
raped a few people just by asking
questions well hooked up to machines

866
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:41,299
and I was always impressed with that and

867
00:55:41,299 --> 00:55:46,420
in the guy said don't ever take a
polygraph

868
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:51,160
unless you absolutely positively sure
that you were telling the truth

869
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,420
and then have somebody issue before you
let the police test

870
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,140
to make sure it's a very scary thing

871
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:02,569
with somebody comes in and says I'm
service is ako

872
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:05,660
effect it s if you weren't nervous you

873
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:08,879
dead or drug to its

874
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,779
its it's not a you know meet situation
hook me up

875
00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:14,459
you know this is not

876
00:56:14,459 --> 00:56:17,999
that's something I want my life it
selects only can look inside your brain

877
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:21,670
ever polygraph examiner is good he can't

878
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:25,999
so it's not so much you know if you is
to take a polygraph

879
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:30,299
you can avoid it avoid it you know

880
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:37,299
other take one again absolutely it's
coming to an expert

881
00:56:37,439 --> 00:56:40,489
less you know I was accused of something
I knew I didn't do

882
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,670
I knew I had examined it did was gonna
test me and he said

883
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:50,989
no problem go ahead take it I wouldn't
do it it's a tense situation

884
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:57,799
your life fun day at the beach the
second

885
00:56:57,799 --> 00:57:01,109
would be more about the heart the actual
she

886
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:04,150
it's obviously come a long way in lassie

887
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,449
fifty years when they started having
machines

888
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:11,709
technological advances trying to move it
into the computer

889
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:15,479
so we'll have it's been a computer here
for about the last

890
00:57:15,479 --> 00:57:18,509
12 years with what I'm thinking

891
00:57:18,509 --> 00:57:21,609
it's more of like written by

892
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:25,170
you have machine that's based on an
interpreter

893
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:28,619
was one person you could have firmware
on

894
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,179
with say the that's right we already
have that you do

895
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:36,499
oh yeah computerized progress now there
is a built in program

896
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:41,939
with three different polygraph exam have
faded their criteria for what's called

897
00:57:41,939 --> 00:57:45,219
America's Court merrick was going is

898
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:49,279
is taught at the back to school
polygraph and was developed because

899
00:57:49,279 --> 00:57:53,469
these thinking is three results in a
polygraph test to the possible

900
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:59,459
truthful deceptive inconclusive
inconclusive they were trying to make

901
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:00,849
that is smaller

902
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:06,479
part %uh the equation in the way to do
that is fine

903
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:10,839
numerical score way we grade the cardio

904
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:17,839
numero and the GSR and control question
versus the road love the question and by

905
00:58:18,949 --> 00:58:20,769
using comparative numbers

906
00:58:20,769 --> 00:58:24,759
its easier to score so what happens in
this computerized

907
00:58:24,759 --> 00:58:28,829
I'll get there they have now is three
different people

908
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:32,209
have stayed in this objective

909
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:36,150
scoring with okay that is

910
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:39,849
feted to the computer as you taking the
test

911
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:44,630
that three different so there's an
average there

912
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:49,069
so the computer will actually score that
person based on the subjective

913
00:58:49,069 --> 00:58:53,839
reliance at three different polygraph
exam and it'll come up with

914
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,779
an answer for the exam in the examiner
also

915
00:58:57,779 --> 00:59:01,619
rates that sure so that is for people

916
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:05,599
right choice that one so is much more

917
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:09,679
scientific a computerized ever before
which

918
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,469
would you say as far as as far as how
they've come to current-day

919
00:59:13,469 --> 00:59:17,119
it's pretty much until the next
technological revolution it's pretty

920
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,609
much as far as going to go

921
00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:21,670
or is it does it do or

922
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,869
philosophical

923
00:59:24,869 --> 00:59:28,029
differences with the

924
00:59:28,029 --> 00:59:31,829
polygraph industries think all the
American polygraph Association

925
00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:35,589
and did like the

926
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:41,420
the body that would certify US's
examiner

927
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:44,619
there the accreditation on the industry

928
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:48,559
they do all the training and so forth
they want to keep it to these three

929
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:49,469
parameters

930
00:59:49,469 --> 00:59:53,049
know oftentimes a use for pains or

931
00:59:53,049 --> 00:59:56,869
to Neumos so reading to grab your chest

932
00:59:56,869 --> 01:00:00,089
around you had but

933
01:00:00,089 --> 01:00:03,808
I think as time goes on in the polygraph
industry shrinks

934
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:07,949
because the private sector is going to
be going tolley to sexually

935
01:00:07,949 --> 01:00:12,199
Korea did testing and to a specific laws

936
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:15,920
I think they're going to have to
entertain other parameters such as voice

937
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,049
says you know if you went to college e

938
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:23,279
or a whatever especially that %eh

939
01:00:23,279 --> 01:00:27,589
computers the technology is either there

940
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:31,859
on the break to being there to add those
parameters and make it more scientific

941
01:00:31,859 --> 01:00:35,259
the problem is always been since five
versus US

942
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:40,880
1923 a court rules then that polygraph
wasn't art and other sites

943
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,699
so became more scientific it was not
going to be admitted

944
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:48,170
and that's why I get always miss you
questions

945
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:51,349
but it was sense that is you it's always
been admitted

946
01:00:51,349 --> 01:00:55,659
stipulation is becoming more more
scientific or else the courts

947
01:00:55,659 --> 01:01:00,880
in the western states United States
wouldn't require that these

948
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:05,670
sex offenders take these polygraphs to
stay out of jail

949
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,890
so you know it has more credibility
within the legal community

950
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:14,199
and certainly within law enforcement
community they it does within the public

951
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:15,509
because I've

952
01:01:15,509 --> 01:01:18,609
the way was beat down by politicians and
labor

953
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:22,880
in the eighties is it is much better
than it was in the eighties

954
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,489
that we have the early nineties they
come up with computerized

955
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:30,619
which is also been approved use piranha
da Smith

956
01:01:30,619 --> 01:01:34,749
us format and now its windows and when
they first came out with this program

957
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:37,659
would crash or time

958
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:40,689
yeah now it's better in and the course

959
01:01:40,689 --> 01:01:43,949
up will probably come out there verges I

960
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:48,009
it's getting better but in fact again

961
01:01:48,009 --> 01:01:52,029
people or get hung up one polygraph lie
can and does not endorse

962
01:01:52,029 --> 01:01:55,739
school it is a tool that investigators
use

963
01:01:55,739 --> 01:01:59,319
not people do in social engineering I me

964
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:02,920
as they go to jail we verified

965
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,799
bad guys and bad guys good guys a good
guys all that good stuff

966
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:12,099
to its its use by law enforce used by
the government

967
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:15,429
you know people have been coming up with
views which is Voice

968
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:19,119
thing that they can use with it do with
a business deal

969
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,839
or they're playing poker you know 8

970
01:02:22,839 --> 01:02:26,429
is this a good liars

971
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:30,709
and you need I believe you need 11
around you you think is more than one

972
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:33,859
parameter in your voice

973
01:02:33,859 --> 01:02:38,009
I'm not buying into that one forever his
voice won primaries

974
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:42,339
or 01 primers pupils what drives your
penis when travelers

975
01:02:42,339 --> 01:02:46,159
your breathing that's a parameter to be
voices one parameter

976
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,529
even though you think there's a lot of
things and there may be

977
01:02:49,529 --> 01:02:55,019
in the cardio there's probably eleven
different areas we look at cardio

978
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:59,329
so voice may have 5 10 20 whatever

979
01:02:59,329 --> 01:03:02,429
to me it's one trap

980
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:06,429
polygraphs come a long way it's going to
go a long ways

981
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:13,429
technology pros

982
01:03:13,929 --> 01:03:18,089
courses for reggie I use a good
icebreaker when you walk into a polly's

983
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:22,170
looks nothing like my polygraph test
homes further

984
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,439
knows what's good question have you was

985
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:28,869
back appears polly's different types of
things

986
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:32,069
something called in do starvation

987
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:35,630
you talked about being able to you
circumvent

988
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:39,819
were to be able to give false positives
to you polygraphs by using

989
01:03:39,819 --> 01:03:44,369
induced reactions so therefore during
during a polygraph

990
01:03:44,369 --> 01:03:49,650
the person attack

991
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:52,809
you that valid statement in your pieces

992
01:03:52,809 --> 01:03:56,219
what you do for a living actually affect
results what's a statement the pin

993
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:57,009
induced

994
01:03:57,009 --> 01:04:00,689
in deputies reaction actually

995
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:04,979
Sui polygraphs cool you play with that
with the TACA you tell when the shoe

996
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:08,269
at the right time uwe

997
01:04:08,269 --> 01:04:11,509
pushed down you tell which causes pain

998
01:04:11,509 --> 01:04:15,769
which causes a reaction a what that
calls for

999
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:20,039
so every russian the scene

1000
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:24,489
well the way way polygraph is judged is
a control question

1001
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:28,229
roving course in most methods

1002
01:04:28,229 --> 01:04:31,439
in some methods the control question is
also the row

1003
01:04:31,439 --> 01:04:35,929
quest so if examiner is

1004
01:04:35,929 --> 01:04:40,549
keen shopping does we should do he
should be noticing that this guy's

1005
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:41,859
flexible

1006
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:45,359
you know I me that's less

1007
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,630
I want to see you setup use it anywhere
and

1008
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:52,249
put this stack anywhere on your body
induced pain yourself in

1009
01:04:52,249 --> 01:04:55,499
twitch OC do that

1010
01:04:55,499 --> 01:04:58,759
I wanna see anybody so i watch myself XO
yet

1011
01:04:58,759 --> 01:05:01,819
let me people have been do this acting
this isn't new sir

1012
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:05,199
this has been going on for forty or
fifty years

1013
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,229
a you know if the examiners watched exam

1014
01:05:08,229 --> 01:05:12,219
gets beat that the polygraph all the
polygraph does is record

1015
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:15,339
you physiological responses wanted those

1016
01:05:15,339 --> 01:05:19,058
responses would be to pee self-induced
pain

1017
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:24,109
but you have to know methods a polygraph
there are seven different methods

1018
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:27,709
that or approved by the APA

1019
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:32,049
and recognized you have to know every
one of those methods and

1020
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:36,119
when the reaction has to be bigger than
the other react

1021
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:40,199
the somewhere along the line if you do
two three or four charts

1022
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:44,400
is a polygraph exam it gets you may beat
which

1023
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,599
we're a few more choice if the white you
get confused

1024
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,809
space because you went to school is
paying the new system

1025
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:55,659
so again polygraph is only good as the
examiner

1026
01:05:55,659 --> 01:05:59,049
polygraph is no more than a cassette
recorder

1027
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:04,179
set up to your body instead sound fall

1028
01:06:04,179 --> 01:06:07,529
tried exploit poly

1029
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:10,999
what you can chemical dues

1030
01:06:10,999 --> 01:06:14,630
issues such as special case instead

1031
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:18,059
to Smith 40 Ali do

1032
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:21,659
ecstasy Holly to go

1033
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:24,940
within 72 hours for

1034
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:29,940
you know it's coming rights has been
published

1035
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,229
for to be

1036
01:06:33,229 --> 01:06:37,239
in interesting

1037
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:40,369
your people take small

1038
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:44,349
under the influence tactic first

1039
01:06:44,349 --> 01:06:47,469
again if it's heart

1040
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:50,719
the first first question with the last
question

1041
01:06:50,719 --> 01:06:55,839
every polygraphs your in in every school
I've ever heard

1042
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:00,199
you taken any drugs to

1043
01:07:00,199 --> 01:07:03,880
to pass this test

1044
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:10,010
wording its

1045
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:14,619
its 44 jay is what we call its to a
question you take it in the

1046
01:07:14,619 --> 01:07:19,339
drugs to to pass this test which which
numbers have you had sex which leaves

1047
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:24,109
but it's the last question every

1048
01:07:24,109 --> 01:07:27,490
every char a I given these

1049
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:31,450
over 10,000 yes what happens is

1050
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:35,060
if you get a guys taking drugs was taken
drugs you have

1051
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:40,069
what we call flight choice know is there
be no reaction different than the other

1052
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:45,450
the only place you get a reaction is
when you use the drug question

1053
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,760
so I its its it seems pretty simple

1054
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,390
he's guilty his life if you know Cooper
the first thing we see for someone who

1055
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:54,650
said person that we've never

1056
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:57,900
nice I'll talk when we get real friendly
what's going on

1057
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,599
day data list this is serious year

1058
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:04,690
sit down do exactly as it a do

1059
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:07,789
if you don't follow my instructions I'm

1060
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:14,069
take it you are deceptive as that this
is serious is a freakin heart attack

1061
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:17,330
deal so somebody's mood

1062
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:21,460
me tried I just think it's interesting
to

1063
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,679
go for direction you have troops there
docked

1064
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:28,509
troops there polly's true movements

1065
01:08:28,509 --> 01:08:31,920
from your side Francis like israel's
their captivity

1066
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,290
Europe iraq which the with you squeezed

1067
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:40,028
things polly's true sobs

1068
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:44,270
morning comments for avoiding such does
have wireless

1069
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:49,630
for civil somebody's gonna give you a
force polygram you can cause all kinds

1070
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:51,989
reaction to the hope of aggressive
progress

1071
01:08:51,989 --> 01:08:55,290
so then the bad guys gonna say

1072
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,850
his life so it's watchable

1073
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:05,850
I mean it does it work under torture
situation this is a continuation

1074
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:12,750
loss plan questioning how would you be
it how would I be

1075
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:16,658
that take every 20 decide you

1076
01:09:16,658 --> 01:09:19,969
with where you are listed don't take a
polygraph

1077
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:23,880
unless you absolutely positive you were
telling the truth and then you come to

1078
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:24,170
work

1079
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:27,420
guy like me and say let's make sure I'm
telling the truth

1080
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:32,049
don't take there's no reason to subject
yourself to that

1081
01:09:32,049 --> 01:09:36,259
find a different job category: so

1082
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:40,259
you don't think there's any way to be
devoured yeah there's

1083
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,460
this way so easy with your in the chair
you can

1084
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:47,139
there's ways to be the polygraph yes you
know discuss this year

1085
01:09:47,139 --> 01:09:54,139
a I get a lot of money today from Canada

1086
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:03,600
and in Canada there is someone who by

1087
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,630
background check on themselves from
company in the internet called

1088
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:11,190
have occurred com and so

1089
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:14,679
they'll it also came with a
psychological profile and they didn't

1090
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:15,630
like what they saw

1091
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:19,330
next a book extra bonus was it see it
was

1092
01:10:19,330 --> 01:10:22,960
tuner box or something i thinkin this US
company will

1093
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,650
give you your profile for this person in
Canada so the person gave

1094
01:10:27,650 --> 01:10:30,960
the results to became government the
Privacy Commissioner there

1095
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,090
and the Privacy Commissioner compel the
company US to you

1096
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,219
tell them their sources how they got
this information

1097
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:42,330
so I ordered one of those myself to see
you know what my

1098
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:46,360
profile and results back yet

1099
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,699
but where you so I'm assuming they hire

1100
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:53,199
best can't to go information

1101
01:10:53,199 --> 01:10:56,520
but how does that information exactly
and

1102
01:10:56,520 --> 01:11:00,159
with the difference between you know yet
for two hundred dollars

1103
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:06,290
better mystery risk without see what
they gave to you will give to you

1104
01:11:06,290 --> 01:11:09,909
no way of determining we'll have to see
what information is included

1105
01:11:09,909 --> 01:11:14,059
I sometimes the format we can tell

1106
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,900
because all the database information do
checks we can tell where it came from

1107
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:21,530
but without having it would be able to
tell as far as a psychological

1108
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:22,699
evaluation

1109
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:25,880
these are he said yes uses

1110
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,219
question thing where you work with the
pencil is that it no no you buy you can

1111
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:31,570
buy someone else's profile

1112
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:35,370
so by somebody else yeah

1113
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:40,110
that's what they claim right so
apparently this person got it and Senate

1114
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:43,440
governments you know this is accurate on

1115
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:49,350
by me democrat there

1116
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:53,120
there are companies out there that we're
going demographics for a lot of

1117
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,019
different things like

1118
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:59,270
why we put macdonell's it is cooler this
core how come the crime rate is so high

1119
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,770
here

1120
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:06,770
me do it by company measures crime rate
justice

1121
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:12,190
we have to know the criteria that they
use

1122
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:15,500
to to cooperate a you know is

1123
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,640
basically then to see profile

1124
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,130
you think it's kinda what they probably
do is

1125
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:26,950
is credit you know we have attorneys
nobody else call 772 credit report his

1126
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:27,550
individual

1127
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:30,690
and they don't have a signed
authorization we can do it credit

1128
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:31,500
profile

1129
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:34,770
which basically means users you know
district wreckers records everything

1130
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:36,160
else fine and I mean losses

1131
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:39,530
who sued now bankruptcy

1132
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:43,730
was coming guys got a bankruptcy never
give money

1133
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:50,730
profile probably the same records

1134
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:58,520
basically questionable

1135
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,690
more this someone some sort of

1136
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:06,700
like a secret mission some cancer

1208
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:27,840
PI's or chrome lawyers credit credit
card companies now offering a service

1209
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,579
with a monitor your

1210
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:33,820
credit scores by the three different
major credit cried

1211
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:38,829
rated companies a they give you a
compilation is that every three months

1212
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:39,768
they send it to you

1213
01:17:39,769 --> 01:17:43,719
and what that shows any new accounts
they're open up

1214
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:48,820
any unusual activity any cause that you
didn't know about would be on there

so three-month window is pretty much
pretty quick

1217
01:17:55,749 --> 01:18:01,320
where you can nip this in the bud go to
the bank that issued the lonely you did

1218
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:01,869
make

1219
01:18:01,869 --> 01:18:06,079
with the credit card and a a list here
where that credit card is

1220
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,789

person was from you can nip this in the

1221
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:11,909
