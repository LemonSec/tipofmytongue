1
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,219
my son is in the audience and one of the
things I really like about this year

2
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:21,329
is that i've seen. hackers carrying
around babies and i've seen

3
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,450
parent hackers bringing teenager hackers
and this is a good thing

4
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,180
this is a good thing this is the
lifeboat um

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,739
you guys energize me because the stuff I
tell you that you cheer when I say this

6
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,449
in washington they should their pants so
they yell they say oh fuck who is this

7
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,200
lunatic

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,280
arm but we're making progress on right
now this year because I've done this

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,300
three times now

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,210
I decided to give you a very fast brief
in here it is

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,010
are if you google in Google

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,550
news for hackers and steel

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,110
you will get a press release that gives
you tiny your else to both the briefs

14
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,620
that I given at this conference

15
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,590
except that the first brief I added to
slide sandal update their tomorrow

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,790
well these are the elements in
intelligence

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,000
your government is fucking stupid okay

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,310
call brief history of intelligence
secret war strategic analysis more

19
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,690
nation spine issues but collective
intelligence

20
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,679
this is it me this is guys like Tom
atlee that has the co intelligence

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,530
Institute

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,780
this is guys like howard reingold it's
really about smart mobs this is about

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,080
what's whatever his name is I can't
pronounce it it's it's like polish

24
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,280
on steroids our wisdom of the crowds
army of Davids

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,020
okay the Internet has empowered the
people right now there is a race

26
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,908
between dick cheney and white collar
criminals on wall street

27
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,619
and us with the Internet and that's what
I want to win

28
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:59,310
so you wouldn't believe this

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,380
but your government spends $60 billion
dollars a year

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,039
on the five percent in the information
they can steal and they don't spend shit

31
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:14,450
on open sources and 183 languages we'd
like to operate out of

32
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,290
embassies diplomatic cover so when we
still codebooks

33
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,230
the entire CIA station comes in at five
o'clock at night

34
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,310
the foreign guards call local liaison

35
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,950
hate CIA's working tonight local liaison

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,470
watches the airwaves and sees the mass
communications between the embassy in

37
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,450
the embassy

38
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,099
our embassy US Embassy in the embassy
that was stealing a codebook from

39
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:43,700
hello this is not rocket science

40
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,700
the next morning they walk into the
ambassador and say hi see I was in your

41
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,680
office last night

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,810
and you can ask me later about how we
walk through walls and all that good

43
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,150
shit

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,770
arm we don't fucking process what we
collect

45
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,580
and oh by the way what we collect is
less than 10 percent of what we need to

46
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:01,900
know

47
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,620
no data standards although I gotta tell
you

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,550
there is one small tiny part in the US
intelligence community that I like

49
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,940
the chief information officer
major-general mayor rose

50
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,209
is not only in today to standards and
sharing he shocked

51
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,280
CIA security officers by having a forum

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,239
open 24 nurse what a concept

53
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,940
we don't tag all over stuff in 1988

54
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,129
I told the intelligent 1988 that's like
the last century

55
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,190
okay I told the intelligence community
if you don't have fucking geospatial

56
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:44,109
attributes on every day time you cannot
do real time all source processing that

57
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,670
says tell me everything there is to know
about this click going back two hundred

58
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,190
years

59
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,590
polo sorry I'm getting excited

60
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:57,420
it's all these black t-shirts they
really turn me on alright

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,040
self no interoperability no also sharing

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,190
now I'm gonna go through these real fast
because we want to get to this thing

63
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,019
emphasis on security and said %uh
vance's would you believe this

64
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:12,379
CIA security is so fucking stupid

65
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:15,569
it is based on guys with high school
educations that have

66
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:21,400
got promoted by checking safe said Nike
that they insist on hiring high school

67
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,789
kids from kansas that are virgins who
have never talked a foreigner

68
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:28,469
is a very small group K

69
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,369
and once you're a CIA analyst if you
dare call a foreigner in the country

70
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:35,289
responsible for you get investigated

71
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:40,938
alone who were focused on threats a set
of opportunities

72
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:45,469
now in my earlier speech I talked about
the 10 threats the united nations has

73
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,550
identified now and with that

74
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,839
the bottom line is that the US
government is focused on less than 20

75
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,719
percent

76
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:55,498
love what matters

77
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:59,240
we focus on local now instead of global
future

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,499
this is symptomatic love wall street
owning the US government

79
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:09,270
we don't impact on the budget if you
really want to know what the US budget

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,119
and policy is actually if you wanna know
US policies you look at the budget

81
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:16,399
I'll tell you what US policy is on
Homeland Security to date is pork

82
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:23,399
combined with incompetence thanks

83
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:27,759
this is a no bullshit statement

84
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,869
this is well documented in the
literature

85
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:35,279
your policy makers don't know shit about
the real world

86
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,210
they know about winning votes in their
local constituencies were pinhead select

87
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,308
pinheads

88
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:44,539
that so we have to change

89
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,909
we having fun yet 53

90
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,119
alright part of the problem and I love
you guys

91
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:57,599
because you know you energize me you
really do

92
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:02,369
I feel blessed did I somehow got hooked
up with this I can even remember maybe

93
00:06:02,369 --> 00:06:03,479
when short own

94
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,469
recommended me to Emmanuel

95
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:12,308
senator boren David

96
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:16,679
something or other arm Bergen maybe

97
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:20,619
have both talked about the need to
internally internationalize US education

98
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:24,249
and we all know and I absolutely love
that anarchists poster schools its

99
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,330
prisons

100
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,378
which is why from my son here to set
them free on

101
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:34,899
but the fact of the matter is US schools
sock

102
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:39,770
alright they were created to build
factory workers

103
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,409
and that's one of the things we've got a
change

104
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:46,589
so my vision for national Intelligence's

105
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:49,610
I'm gonna take the sixty billion dollars

106
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:53,399
I'm gonna cut the spice the $20 billion
a month but the other forty billion in

107
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,819
education

108
00:06:54,819 --> 00:07:01,709
including online distance learning and
so forth

109
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:06,369
believe it or not US intelligence
doesn't impact on what we buy

110
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:09,050
when I stood up the Marine Corps
intelligence command I looked at the

111
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,449
real world that go by the way

112
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:16,539
we buy airplanes for a warm day that is
not humid

113
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:20,688
the real world is hot and humid this
means that our airplanes built by very

114
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:21,979
expensive

115
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:27,248
are very expensive airplanes have half
the left half the lawyer in half the

116
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:30,139
range

117
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:33,289
as advertised alright

118
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:37,469
we're not building airplanes to a
real-world and oh by the way

119
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:41,129
there's a reason why European companies
don't sell trucks to the third world the

120
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,789
way more than 30 ton so why do we have a
97

121
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:47,688
time artillery system okay or a

122
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:53,289
up 45 ton m1a1 which invented the
concept of gallons per mile

123
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:56,818
okay the US government is stupid

124
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,289
it really is literally stupid I'm not
saying the people are stupid and saying

125
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:04,818
the system is stupid

126
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,469
we have an impact on the private sector
Microsoft should never have been

127
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:12,550
a lawsuit Microsoft should have been a
fucking standard that say you have open

128
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:19,550
API czar will kill you

129
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,969
we build these extremely complex systems

130
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,550
that have absolutely no provision for
how are they going to get smart

131
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,020
the United States government cannot find
fix and follow

132
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,689
an individual or even a unit

133
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,380
alright were static system were built to
follow Soviet Union systems that

134
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,290
start out in just a shin and then build
up over 20 years and then a field test

135
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,579
that and then finally are put in the
field

136
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:52,490
we're not ready for off-the-shelf
warfare

137
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,009
we can't do wide-area surveillance is a
simple reason for this

138
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:00,230
back in the 70s we didn't have the money
and so we had a choice between precision

139
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,540
surveillance and wide-area surveillance
so we went with precision surveillance

140
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,800
to fight soviet missile silos

141
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,860
and that's great but have you ever tried
to do a wide area map

142
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,019
we're using postage stamps at different
times of day different angles a look

143
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,810
different seasons it doesn't fucking
work

144
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,680
can we can to the last mile the United
States government cannot see under

145
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,120
jungle canopy

146
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,490
it cannot see in the case but we like to
use B-two bombers to bonn case okay

147
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,149
B-two bombers fight the United States to
bomb 18 assholes in the cave

148
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,300
this is a really expensive solution

149
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,790
we can't do real time change detection

150
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,349
we have one really big fucking expensive
National Intelligence tried

151
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,379
and we have completely pissed on all the
other intelligence tribes

152
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:54,819
so military law enforcement business

153
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:58,819
journalists non-governmental
organizations

154

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,259
the United States shots all of those out
the equation

156
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,959
we chose to go with secrecy instead of
sharing and exchanging

157
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,459
and I give the I give the CIO for

158
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:18,490
from a buddy and I a lot of credit is
the only asshole up there that knows

159
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,509
what he's doing

160
00:10:19,509 --> 00:10:24,879
arm secrets are primarily valuable in a
context the rich

161
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,870
open source Knowledge Foundation you can
have smart spice in the construct

162
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:33,449
on context to the domination we have a
nation the can't find the fucking next

163
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:35,509
eight

164
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:42,080
okay much less another country

165
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,410
Americans I'm sorry to say in Latin
America they call Istanbul city less

166
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,069
useful idiots that's what we are okay

167
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,910
present company excepted spies Alito
secrets

168
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:01,620
think about them spies only no secrets

169
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,360
spies only know 10 to 15 percent or
reality

170
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,340
the only know what they've stolen they
don't know history

171
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,680
didn't know context they don't know
culture they don't know

172
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,440
political legal socio-economic I do
cultural techno demographic natcher

173
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,180
geographic my first thesis

174
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,420
two decades ago spice don't know what
the fuck is going on let me quote george

175
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,160
tenet

176
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,050
intelligence prostitute first-class okay

177
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:37,720
george tenet speaky to all the allied
intelligence chief said and I quote

178
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,340
we don't know shit I'm not making this
up

179
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,980
so

180
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,450
don't send Aspirus schoolboy can go done

181
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,710
is my 17-year-old would say now

182
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,940
other than the three guys who are sworn
to secrecy is anybody identified by

183
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,520
saying and counter-punch losers

184
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,300
come on you can identify him let's look
at the ice

185
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,950
make sensor add value

186
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:14,400
america has gone wrong into big waz

187
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,730
the first way has been to

188
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:22,300
equate intelligence to secrets
intelligence is not about secrets

189
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,310
intelligence is about making sense

190
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,620
it's about understanding the other way
we have done wrong in general like

191
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,480
Eisenhower warned us about this is by
allowing the military-industrial prison

192
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,190
hospital complex

193
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,020
to basically by the government the US
government no longer represents the

194
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,569
people

195
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,110
love the United States

196
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,690
this is it

197
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,720
this is sixty billion dollars spent

198
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,260
on and ham be generous here twenty
percent of the value because the 80/20

199
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,140
rule is one that kind of works

200
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,360
but the reality is that we're spending
$60 billion dollars on the five to ten

201
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,420
percent of the information we can steal

202
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,130
on the seven to nine targets that dick
cheney

203
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,980
thinks will sell fear okay

204
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,530
we are spending less than sixty million
dollars

205
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:20,680
no less than six hundred million dollars
on the other eighty-five percent now I

206
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,970
will tell you I was a ghost writer for
the Marine Corps

207
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,410
general great publish an article call
global intelligence challenges the 1990s

208
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,969
he publishes article in nineteen

209
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,870
eighty H any said we need to focus on
terrorism we need to focus on revolution

210
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,750
we need to focus on stability we need
folks at all these other things that are

211
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,590
destabilizing the world go by the way

212
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,320
open source intelligence is 85 percent
that nobody wanted to hear it not even

213
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,050
for me not even from the Commandant of
the Marine Corps

214
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,190
this is the slide I've shown you before

215
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:57,300
follow hahaha okays blondie here

216
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,589
the we know she's not a real blind up

217
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,080
my lover i mean i you know i mean i mean
you wanna hear sexism hey buddy let's go

218
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,150
have a drink at work it out

219
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:10,630
are okay mom let me explain it

220
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,839
then I will explain it that's a good
that's the point what I have done with

221
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:15,390
this

222
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,030
chart is taking the 10 threats that the
united nations has identified

223
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:24,750
and I've gone back in time to look at
all these policy books mandate for

224
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,880
change you know everything the democrats
and the republicans right with their

225
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,089
lobbying for positions in the next
administration and I'm gonna have to

226
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:34,940
change this because all about to talk to
every committee chairman in the senate

227
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,800
some half dead agriculture

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,770
among other things are but basically if
you look at this we're fucked on Dec

229
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,819
security in water

230
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,980
an energy arm and

231
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,220
ecology and then you have these big dogs
here

232
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:56,770
we don't have a strategy for how do we
help the big dogs avoid our mistakes for

233
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,640
example China is in the business right
now I've selling cars to Chinese

234
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,569
this is about is fucking stupid as you
can get okay because there are a lot of

235
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:05,880
them

236
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,480
and China is got 300 water stress cities

237
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,339
night a lot issues here and so we don't
have this strategy this holistic

238
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:16,780
strategy

239
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,790
that rice to help people come to grips
with reality

240
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,189
and some with you may not have been at
my other speech but I love trotsky

241
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,400
statement you know you may not be
interested in war but wars interest that

242
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:27,790
you

243
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,459
well this administration may not be
interested in reality but I sure your

244
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:33,030
reality is interested in Aus

245
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,579
okay so that CNN this

246
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,560
slideshow any questions and this is
completely improper I'd like to get to

247
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,160
bed by

248
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,660
by one but I'll do whatever you want me
to do and yes sir

249
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,579
over there in a the Micron I %ah white

250
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,780
likes

251
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:01,329
camera action I'm sure fatten ball they
don't think I'm a movie star

252
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,600
alright so I'm sure that if I look I was
on da come you probably ever view of

253
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,070
over

254
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,670
already part how r have you read the
Pentagon's new math

255
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,630
and do you think parents implementing
some of the ideas in that book in the

256
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:15,780
cover my have read the Pentagon's new
map

257
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,220
that book should have remained an
article yeah

258
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,950
on it does then is a well-meaning young
man who was never read anything by

259
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:24,990
anybody else

260
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,800
had some good ideas have his own on he
has been overly influenced by Wall

261
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,450
Street

262
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:34,800
are I would place that book at about the
third-ranked well

263
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,120
he does talk a lot about connecting the
intelligence community back with the

264
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,790
restive

265
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,890
the world mostly when he talks about in
that book is how fucked up the pentagon

266
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,350
processes which is why I gave it an
extra star

267
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,880
okay it's not a serious book

268
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,519
I'm sorry okay thanks

269
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,639
I the 9/11 truth movement has several
schools

270
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,839
one is the key in Hamilton Commission

271
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,110
that's the official conspiracy theory

272
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,140
and that's a conspiracy theory that

273
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,449
I'm the for school excess

274
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:19,520
the second one is the official
conspiracy theory

275
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,639
but with some questions the next one sir

276
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,640
is the one that said that says we

277
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,900
we knew it was going to happen and there
was a breakdown

278
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,110
and I think that's what you're alluding
to

279
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,309
that we're stupid were incompetent but
Sir

280
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:45,530
the one that's the most economists irma
Robert okay Robert

281
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:51,610
Robert the one that it first seems to be
the most extreme

282
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,830
but upon investigation

283
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,129
is it's the one

284
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,370
that's the least all the conspiracy
theories

285
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,590
it's the one that's the least outrageous

286
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,600
and that's that the 1i told you before
that you were referring to

287
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,299
if you were leading up to this that were
incompetent

288
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:17,450
let it happen lie lie hop

289
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,049
really is superseded upon those who
really care

290
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,840
about this tragedy not only for the
heartbreak within New York

291
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,309
but even in this moment what's happening
with Israel and Lebanon

292
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:35,740
is my hot made it happen on purpose

293
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,460
that there's no laptop computer in a
cave in Afghanistan

294
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,750
and eighteen people who may hate us like
crazy but simply do not have the ability

295
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,500
with box cutters to to bring down

296
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,280
a building and where you're going with
this I wanna know which school is I want

297
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,360
I wanna know which school of thought
your end

298
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,580
excuse me

299
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:11,580
that's fine okay stop right there I'll
answer your question

300
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,500
there are several converging themes in
my judgment converging theme number one

301
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,110
is that the US intelligence community
has consistently over the last 50 years

302
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,420
and certainly over the last eighteen
years when I first started this dog

303
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,040
fighting

304
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,040
eighteen years ago I discovered that
eighty to ninety percent of what we

305
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,510
needed to know about the real world

306
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,890
was not secret not in English not online

307
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,010
and not known to anybody in Washington
including the menopausal grandmothers in

308
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,090
the foreign broadcast information
service

309
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,370
okay and I use that insult deliberately
for

310
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,730
unfortunately they're married if they're
married not married managed by young

311
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,440
white boys in button countdown collars
don't know fuck all about the world

312
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,720
okay are Sophie number one is we shut
out eighty percent of the information we

313
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,830
needed to know in order to understand

314
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:05,389
the extremist a hobby is something that
was being pushed out

315
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,650
the number two is that the central
intelligence agency has been politicized

316
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,960
for all too long

317
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,750
to the point that they have been for be
to talk to opposition groups and Saudi

318
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,870
Arabia Egypt Iran and elsewhere

319
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,540
K so CIA's basically

320
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:28,340
a castrated service that is limited to
talking to foreign liaison which he ends

321
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:28,959
film

322
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,080
what they want them to know or eighty

323
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,510
there's a thirteen here and I've read

324
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,170
most of the books in fact the have a
list on Amazon and books indicting dick

325
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,430
cheney for 9/11

326
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,760
Dick Cheney was in charge have an
exercise

327
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,610
on 911 he was

328
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,790
in charge of the entire US government he
was using the secret services

329
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,520
communication control channel

330
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,129
there is a strong body of literature
that suggests that dick cheney

331
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,160
decided that he wanted to let 9/11
happened there is a strong body of

332
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,850
literature

333
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,720
that says that dick cheney very
deliberately allowed george bush to make

334
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,230
an ass of himself by reading a book
upside down

335
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,600
and then moving him around the country
so that dick cheney could stay in

336
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,210
washington and be in charge

337
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,730
it is my absolute judgment that dick
cheney is impeachable

338
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,000
indictable and criminally negligent
right

339
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,030
new there are other

340
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:35,970
some themes in the literature the FBI

341
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,040
is probably the most moronic incompetent
agency the US government okay

342
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:45,930
and by the way I am NOT agent steel

343
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,930
agent steel is a guy with one leg okay

344
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,360
and it's spelled S T E A L and when I
was

345
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,570
woken up make it after flying in from
Australia in Chicago

346
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,980
they quickly discovered I was not agent
steel okay

347
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,710
but they were beautiful very young
people I'd love to meet a cheerleader

348
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:03,140
again

349
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:09,570
arm the fact of the matter is the FBI
and CIA have been dicking around

350
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:13,409
with half ass recruitments while
shutting out people

351
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:18,990
it is a known documented fact that there
were to walk into the FBI one in Orlando

352
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,300
one in Newark New Jersey

353
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,480
a year prior to 9/11 and these walk-ins
revealed the entire 9/11 plot the reveal

354
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,650
the names of the

355
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,220
people involved but they were what we
would call virgins

356
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,610
K they weren't in the records and the
9/11

357
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,460
the FBI people check their records and
so what we've never heard of these

358
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,800
people so you must be a fucking asshole
get outta here

359
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,930
that's the way the US government works

360
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,270
so I guess I would sum this up

361
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,139
by saying that right now the
neo-conservatives and the radical

362
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,430
islamic fundamentalists love each other

363
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:57,590
because they're using the politics of
fear

364
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:02,750
to steal a spline but you didn't answer
my question re: what's your question

365
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,410
Edwin one-sentence

366
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:09,050
lie hop let it happen still presupposes

367
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,330
that people who have who have been

368
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,510
discovered they're not nineteen
hijackers

369
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,190
have them then been discovered and

370
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,380
and have them even if they wanted to
they simply couldn't handle

371
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,410
I'm sorry I'm saying you either lie hop
are my hoppin lie hop is very

372
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,490
destructive

373
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,760
can someone explain this question to let
it happen on purpose years

374
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,440
you're telling me that made it happen on
Perseus

375
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,960
made it happen on purpose night next but
i just ask for some humility because I

376
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,210
have a nice question

377
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:47,390
wouldn't being thank you

378
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:51,540
good evening huh are you gonna do a
striptease

379
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,370
on on first

380
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,290
for on I

381
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:03,379
she's gorgeous alright was thank you
good evening

382
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,040
in any event on you were discussing

383
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,110
the technological advancements going on
within the CIA and 1/2 know there are no

384
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,960
technological advancements going right

385
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,710
okay okay let me start over then again
arm

386
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:22,100
their former CIA directors did focus
less

387
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,410
on rar human intelligence four-time

388
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,700
ground Intel and the focus more on

389
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,110
technological advancements saturday was
his filter now

390
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,710
use you one can certainly see with
Mahmoud montana jod and Iran what's

391
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,050
going on there because there isn't much
rar human intelligence

392
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:45,930
my question for you is this how would
you address this issue that

393
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:51,040
because during a certain point the CIA
did focus on that and now

394
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:55,040
were missing people in the field for
human intelligence

395
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,250
wrong like that how would you address
that issue

396
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,820
I actually have a press release on this
topic

397
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,139
if you go to my website aren't you will
see a table of contents my website I I

398
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,900
realize I have 30,000 pages on my
website

399
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,980
and it didn't occur to me until this
year after I had a very bad experience

400
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,040
with Wikipedia that nobody is fucking
reading

401
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,460
a low level 1 is so I've created a sort
a pool table of contents and in there

402
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,320
you'll find a press release called

403
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,020
revitalizing the clandestine service
here's what it boils down to

404
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,550
in the nineteen fifties and sixties we
had a clandestine service that looked

405
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,379
like the United Nations

406
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,300
he would walk into the CIA and we
separate the analysts so we didn't trust

407
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,500
me when I was a case of San I was taking
up to see the analysts

408
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,180
in the nineteen eighties my chief the
station said don't tell my fucking thing

409
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,910
okay this is how CIA works arm

410
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,570
today the entire intelligence community
has been completely destroyed by a grip

411
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,740
on T in this this

412
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:01,490
this thousand person bullshit promotion
above the Peter Principle

413
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,120
arm there is a very simple

414
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,830
in city clandestine intelligence which
is why police don't know shit

415
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,639
you have to have multilateral
multinational stations

416
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,260
in which the Americans provide the money
in the processing technology in the

417
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,290
management

418
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:23,920
an indigenous allies provide the street
officers now the problem

419
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,920
is it CIA is married to this concept
have headquarters and Headquarters

420
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,980
liaison

421
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,290
see which is basically code for

422
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:35,270
headquarters assholes line to
headquarters assholes who don't know any

423
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,510
difference

424
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,760
okay the DEA model is much better

425
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,370
the Drug Enforcement Administration
takes officers from the

426
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,600
individual countries and it puts them
off on the side in the bond is a band of

427
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,090
brothers and they do good shit together

428
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:53,980
and they keep their headquarters
ignorant this is the way to do it

429
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,790
alright on so if I were and I've written
several books on this %uh me my first

430
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,870
book on intelligence spice in secrecy in
an open world has a chapter

431
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,460
with 14 specific recommendations which
you can find for free on my website

432
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,620
if you just flipped through you know
refreshing to you see

433
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,120
the free chapter arm this is real simple

434
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,890
we need a national collection agency
that can actually get out on the street

435
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,310
and get down and dirty in in row
koresh's said very clearly we don't do

436
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:24,399
diarrhea

437
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,110
K its easy to penetrate the Taliban all
you do is you take in eighteen a

438
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,610
21-year-old say will give you a million
dollars in 10 years

439
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,450
to fuck up your life for ten years and
come back when you've got contact

440
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,180
okay this is not a problem but we don't
have anybody in america that wants to go

441
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,000
do that except for

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,920
this kid that lyndon whatever it that
made it to Afghanistan but he was in a

443
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,260
CIA case officer

444
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,090
or even an aging he was just a dumb shit
that wanted to go kill people

445
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,540
on hugh

446
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,450
you have to have a clandestine well
first off let me start with open source

447
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,350
agency okay you can't be a serious
spinal issue for snow everything that

448
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,750
can be known legally and ethically

449
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,810
of I will tell you in the head to my
three children the US government doesn't

450
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,990
know fuck all about eighty percent of
the information they need to know

451
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,160
in 183 languages they don't speak

452
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,110
sorry bout that that's your fault

453
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,350
because you're not telling your
government that you expect them to

454
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,470
actually be in touch with reality

455
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,470
what we have right now present company
excepted is pinhead selecting been its

456
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,100
okay and I don't know how we're gonna
change that I don't have answers there

457
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,430
was a wonderful quote downstairs about

458
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:40,350
questions a good answers are arrogant
you're right absolutely I don't have

459
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,140

460
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,150
but when you start with open source
intelligence of I would be and I would

461
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:48,400
have an open source agency at funded at
three billion dollars a year

462
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,460
and once I have everything that agency
can give me I would say to all spice

463
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,710
it's a

464
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,150
show me why you're worth a got damn
penny on top of open source and I will

465
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,830
guarantee you the National
Reconnaissance Office for National

466
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,949
Security Agency

467
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,370
the central intelligence and the
National Geospatial agency would all

468
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,010
fail

469
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:10,400
that test ninety percent of what you
need to know about the real world to

470
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,200
make intelligent strategic decisions is
not secret

471
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,610
and we're just delusional alright

472
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,290
you need a national processing agency
intelligence is less than 10 to 15

473
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,190
percent

474
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,540
but what you need to know I wanna turn
in a sane to national processing agency

475
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,730
were all the operational cables all the
open source stuff

476
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:36,900
everything is part of the speaker mix
and the secrets are simply an add-on

477
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,860
you need a national analysis agency and
in fact the problem with CIA's it only

478
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,980
does secrets

479
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,050
on our targets our agriculture policy

480
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:50,129
our commercial policy are energy policy
or Health and Human Services policy

481
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,420
every single

482
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,700
part of government is totally fucked
because they're bureaucracies with

483
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,670
private sector mafias

484
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,760
that have no interest in faxing reality

485
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,070
the only have an interest in how they
can make a buck unscrew the US citizen

486
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:12,070
does that answer your question thank you
CK next

487
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,850
got your gorgeous yes she is bomb

488
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,330
bahahaha and share your room with my son
and dysfunctional after 18 years a

489
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:20,860
marriage

490
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,720
you next um you'd mention just now

491
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,350
open source intelligence in the past
you've told some great stories

492
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,720
and I'd love for you to telander this
crowd as well one that resonated with me

493
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,840
you mentioned it's a perfect example of
this phenomenon the idea of tracking

494
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,670
plagues before they happen may just
looking at pharmacy receipts

495
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,080
him and to also say stores illegal
immigrants use grocery stores

496
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,199
and also if you wanna tell it on the
story about the map warehouse that's

497
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,220
always a jaw-dropping and I think

498
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,420
okay bomb

499
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:58,530
he had only a there is so much data out
there and I'm very very

500
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,550
interested as well as concerned about
the way in which date is misused I mean

501
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,060
you you provide your

502
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,899
information for one specific thing and
it ends up being accumulated by first

503
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,680
good choice for data point or whatever
on

504
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:16,900
but the reality is there's a lot of good
that can be done with aggregate data

505
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:20,940
I am NOT opposed to what NSA was trying
to do with pattern analysis on phone

506
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:21,980
costs okay

507
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,870
what most people don't realize is that
eighty percent of signals intelligence

508
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:28,150
is pattern analysis not content analysis

509
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:32,230
on but to the to the example we can
predict

510
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,580
we can predict outbreaks have influence
and so forth an illegal alien

511
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,790
communities by watching what's being
sold on the drug on the

512
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:43,420
grocery store drugs shelves

513
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,020
figures illegal immigrants go to the
grocery store rather than a pharmacy

514
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,340
your doctor

515
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,880
mom and I am just absolutely online

516
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,980
by Larry brilliant and Google .org

517
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,220
Larry brilliant is probably gonna win a
Nobel Prize one of these days he's in

518
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,700
the process abusing

519
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,830
a little bit a Google cache 1 percent of
their annual revenue

520
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,990
to plus up the global our public health

521
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,050
intelligence network and it has
intelligence in it

522
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:13,490
and one of the things that Google is
doing his thing massive surveys a

523
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,340
blogs and other things and looking for
references in their credited with

524
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,520
identifying SARS early on

525
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,020
on so this is extremely important as far
as the map thing

526
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,010
I think you're referring to the chinese
burning down the russian warehouse

527
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:32,290
okay well one of the problems with the
US government is we rely so heavily on

528
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:35,270
satellite technology we don't actually
have maps for ninety percent of the

529
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,379
world

530
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,600
and when I talk about maps in talking
about 150 combat charts with contra

531
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,140
lines this is important for infantry
officers

532
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,290
figs it shows you things like deflate
which is how to get from point A to

533
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,080
point B without being killed

534
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,740
are this matters well we don't have
these maps

535
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,770
from when we went into bosnia the
National Geospatial agency was very

536
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,930
proud of sending sixty laptop computers
for 500,000 man

537
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:05,890
on with digital maps 16 laptop computers
for 500,000 man what's wrong with this

538
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,940
picture

539
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,320
okay anyway the russians get all this
the Chinese maps

540
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,620
and Tom we had a chance to buy them for
five million dollars and

541
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,290
both the National Geospatial agency the
Central Intelligence Agency refuse to

542
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:20,510
spend the money

543
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,470
and the Chinese government have this in
the burn down the warehouse

544
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:32,190
12 50,000 12 50,000 with contra lines
this is this is basically like

545
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,320
in this room here you would have four
contour lines

546
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,250
arm and and that's really really
important

547
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,620
next question yeah um so I heard about
public diplomacy

548
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,730
and how it's basically been gutted um

549
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:51,190
in the later part of the clan years the
essence that a blonde bimbo I'm now

550
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,990
using the term valley girl

551
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,810
okay say it say it was good thanks

552
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:01,120
it's a glad it wasn't up

553
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,270
I'll behind you yeah the heckler

554
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,530
K what

555
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,529
K

556
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:15,530
through Robert still drinking game

557
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:21,359
I don't get it I'm missing something
here but go ahead

558
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,610
yeah side just certain where I heard
about this

559
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,210
time sob story about public diplomacy
being

560
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,120
got it was from and undersecretary her
former undersecretary but yes your

561
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,109
opinion is that

562
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:37,420
was relatively useless beforehand

563
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:41,659
the way that was done I am very very
disappointed with the US Department of

564
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,100
State

565
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,630
our first of the US Department of State
is supposed to be the Senior Service

566
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:51,830
it's supposed to be the primary focal
point for developing US for

567
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,549
policy about Foreign Affairs on

568
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,960
you unfortunately have several things
running

569
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,040
badly the first is that the Department
of State

570
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,300
and I tried very hard for like the last
six years

571
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,410
to get to the former state understand
that its original mission

572
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:13,240
its constitutional mission is to collect
interpret

573
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,670
translate disseminate and explain

574
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,710
all information in all languages all the
time didn't want to do it

575
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,920
there a microcosmic bureaucracy that
wants to be an end-user

576
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,990
have intelligence not a collective
intelligence and they simply don't

577
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,200
compute the fact

578
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,450
that the embassies overseas which you
now fortresses that shut out everybody

579
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:37,359
on I suppose to be are eyes and ears

580
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,300
for the eighty to ninety percent of the
information that is legally and

581
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,350
ethically available

582
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:46,470
most diverse state Department officers
do not speak the foreign language

583
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:49,980
properly they don't get out beyond the
cocktail circuit

584
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,600
are your average embassy the expense
account basically is one quarter for the

585
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,120
ambassador's one quarter for the four
political

586
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,200
economic council earn whatever
counselors

587
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,470
and the last half spread across a
hundred officers which means your

588
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,130
average Foreign Service Officer

589
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:10,260
gets to host two lunches and one
reception every quarter

590
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,850
K and they're not given the time in the
money to travel in other provinces

591
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:19,040
so the state department is essentially a
castrated beast

592
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,630
that relies on handouts from people who
are willing to be seen with americans

593
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:27,090
up for free mom this is not good

594
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:30,710
on Condi Rice

595
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:35,690
is as great a white girl is bill clinton
as a black man

596
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:40,080
okay okay

597
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,450
she is absolutely worthless in fact she
so worthless she's worse than madeleine

598
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:45,920
albright

599
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,870
okay saw madeleine albright

600
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,910
deliberately repressed reports on
terrorism

601
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,910
figures madeleine albright wanted to
pretend that everything was on the right

602
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,390
track

603
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,870
and we have been live in today because
madeleine albright didn't have the balls

604
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:06,940
to go after the terrorists and bill
clinton didn't have the balls to go

605
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,530
after the terrorist when they blew up to
embassies in the USS Cole

606
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,840
encumber towers which is directly traced
or Ron

607
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,460
according to the FBI directors memoirs
Skype

608
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:24,460
thank you on can someone teach me the
Robert still drinking game

609
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,560
a 3 thanks

610
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:37,160
future

611
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,399
and and that's the crazy scale go to 10
or 15 do you think do you think there's

612
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:42,890
something

613
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:45,900
especially wrong with the US
intelligence agency

614
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,710
if I very if when depending on it as it
was attacked in there is only one

615
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:56,540
camera that is capturing this footage in
there is no over

616
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,000
I there's no evidence of any plane ovens
or spirit see theory

617
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,390
I am actually among those who is willing
to believe that Donald Rumsfeld had a

618
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:07,940
missile targeted into

619
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,540
an unoccupied area the a pentagon here
at it we're going to win this

620
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,100
yes I am are but I have no proof but I
will tell you that I see no plane parts

621
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,170
I see nobody's

622
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:22,400
for what what's going on in like the CIA
when the

623
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,510
this is that this guy is not responsible
for permit a security for the pentagon

624
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:32,110
were idea FBI ran to any intelligence
agency welcome they never invested this

625
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:36,300
have you considered the possibility that
dick cheney doesn't want them to

626
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,710
why did he actually orchestrated the
attacks himself

627
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,720
I don't know if he orchestrated the
attacks I believe it's something similar

628
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,250
to John Kennedy's assassination were
defenses were let down for very good

629
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,080
reason

630
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,100
I will remind all the view that
operation Northwood

631
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,270
on was sponsored by the crew chiefs of
staff as a pretext to invade

632
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,440
to invade cuba American

633
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,420
general officers and lieutenant colonels
and colonels suggested the murder of

634
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,450
americans the United States of America

635
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,660
back in the sixties in order to justify
an attack on cuba

636
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:11,259
this is how that our system gets do not
underestimate

637
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,440
the potential mendacity if your
government at the political level not at

638
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,360
the bureaucratic level but at the
political level

639
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:22,530
yes sir ok a row it's always fascinating
at to see you fooling the hacker

640

hacker community gassing its it should

692
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,640

okay all one of the things just shut the
fuck up your boring

694
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,970
mom their is there is

695
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,410
definite positive are

696
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,720
evidence their requires

697
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,670
an indictment love dick cheney in the
9/11 Commission which had a lot of

698
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:49,160
conflicts of interest every single
person the 9/11 Commission violated

699
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,720
the congressional mandate that they not
have conflicts of interest

700
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,810
there is absolutely definitely

701
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:59,470
a requirement to look into this is a
popular level just like the Warren

702
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,110
Commission blew the Kennedy
assassination

703
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:06,030
completely covered it up the 9/11
Commission has covered up

704
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,840
all of the problems in the US government
arm

705
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,770
there is definite evidence suggesting an
indictment

706
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,820
but not necessarily a conviction that
the FBI for example was running the

707
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,720
blind sheik in new york

708
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,000
as an asset and that the FBI was in fact

709
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,350
the one who created the car bomb for the
World Trade Center in the first place

710
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,810
and there is definite evidence that

711
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,420
the original plan to attack the World
Trade Center was in fact the plan to

712
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,040
have a nuclear catastrophe

713
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,110
but in a negotiation with Pakistan

714
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,010
and because the arcade it was reasonable

715
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:54,330
al Qaeda is a reasoned enemy they pulled
back from nuclear because it might get

716
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:55,930
outta control

717
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:00,370
and they went for this cultural target
so there are no clear answers

718
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:04,270
there is certainly a great deal love
information that suggests that we have

719
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,370
been deceived where government

720
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:11,430
that this is not been fully investigated
and it requires additional investigation

721
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,399
at a popular level I hope that's a
satisfactory answer for you

722
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,400
next question

723
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,540
Robert I am I wanna say thank someone in
charge I need another picture water

its attitude well it added to queue baby

727
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,210
I the the question I had was about 9/11

728
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:46,540
and on building 7 they're not good
question

729
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,190
there's a lot of people that said the
there some control charges there

730
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,250
and then there's some people that
actually hit were named

731
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,140
as the a people to apply in the
airplanes

732
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,420
actually came back to the embassies and
say hey that wasn't me here I am I'm

733
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:01,950
here

734
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,530
yeah um can you address a as ernie
sources

735
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,710
not take that into parts okay thank you
part number one

736
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:13,240
is these were not all Saudis these were
people in saudi passports

737
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,500
part number two is a lot of these people
were trained at US military bases

738
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,320
part number three is we are not at all
certain that the people who are claimed

739
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,360
to have been on the airplanes actually
died on the airplanes

740
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,000
part number four is that the CIA
building the secret service building

741
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,250
Secret Service dick cheney okay

742
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:35,190
on there was no reason for World Trade
Center building number 72 collapses it

743
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,800
did

744
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,890
from there is in crossing the Rubicon
Khan in other books that I have read I

745
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:40,660
do read

746
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,850
mom there is some

747
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:47,470
suggestion that there was a CA

748
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,560
a pentagon installed controlling

749
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,180
thing on these airplanes and blowing and
others have developed capabilities

750
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,160
actually fly airplanes from here
Australian back without pilots

751
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,690
there is some small evidence were the
oven investigation but not conclusion

752
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:09,030
right right that these airplanes were
actually on override control

753
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,960
from World Trade Center 7 and that the
reason World Trade Center

754
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,290
worth seven was destroyed was to conceal
all the stuff thank you sir

755
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,960
arm I don't know what the answer is I do
know that I don't trust my government

756
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,360
right

757
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,360
so as an intelligence officer and out
what's

758
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,730
what do you think is difference between
intelligence and intelligence officer

759
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:33,080
this this is true this is very true but
as an intelligent man

760
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:37,009
what's your opinion on the best way that
we as people

761
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:41,190
can have a good dialogue without getting
too emotional about it but bringing

762
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,330
facts

763
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,259
and not sarcastic good innuendoes it's
fun to do that just to have fun

764
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,580
you know if we want to have their fun
but the in reality to really

765
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,009
ugh get a the truth rolling

766
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,680
and find I'll the accountability is
where we can what's

767
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,710
what your a best process and then thank
you

768
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:06,090
alright arm I have said publicly

769
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:11,680
Inc inge not a big shot you know I'm a
guy that just survives on a salary

770
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,589
in and tries to do this stuff and you're
actually my most reset the violence and

771
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:17,530
that's a sorry ass state of affairs

772
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,440
quickly the from

773
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,580
if I have said publicly that we need to
Truth and Reconciliation commissions

774
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,120
are we need a truth and reconciliation
commission on all the bad shit we've

775
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,589
done overseas

776
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:36,700
on including are preventing Iran from
having its elected people and and the

777
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,800
nationalization it's a little

778
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,840
mom we have created many of these
problems ourselves we have sown the

779
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,260
dragon's teeth

780
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,400
we also the truth and reconciliation
Commission here at home

781
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,110
on wall street has deliberately screwed
the working poor and the middle class

782
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:58,750
and Dom we seem to just take it because
in the past there was enough wealth the

783
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,560
kind of key person beer

784
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,040
in cigarettes and gasoline and now
that's all going away

785
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,910
it's the end of cheap oil it's the into
free water

786
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:12,940
on diseases prevalent there a lot of
things going on

787
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,620
I don't know what it's gonna take I am
in fact despite my gloom in

788
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,980
gloom and doom lemme

789
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:27,530
a on white no doubt show Outlook Outlook

790
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:31,490
the side might doom and gloom slideshow
an actually optimistic

791
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:36,440
on I think and if you look at my website
0 assessed on that you've got a public

792
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,590
Daily Brief this public Daily Brief is
free

793
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:45,030
the president's Daily Brief cost 60
billion dollars a year he can read it

794
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,490
okay bomb so

795
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,310
in that you when you click on agassi a
change in policy curve I think we're

796
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:53,870
right at the costs

797
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:58,670
okay I spent 18 years flatlining and I
think we're now about to go up

798
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:01,470
and we're not about to go up because the
me we're about to go up because the

799
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,270
internet

800
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,920
because a Google because if Doug Ingle
bart's open hypertext documents system

801
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,100
because the Semantic Web and synthetic
information

802
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:14,060
because citation analysis is moving to
the paragraph a micro cash level

803
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,759
there's a whole buncha thinks they're
about to start happening

804
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,830
and that's all good on

805
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:25,549
South I've lost my train of thought what
was your question

806
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:30,650
with the original yeah go back old

807
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:34,720
how do we do it systematically well this
group is well known for ignoring me

808
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,270
arm in 1994 I suggested that they create
a server

809
00:49:39,270 --> 00:49:43,590
and that they start the I cataloguing
all

810
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:47,960
of laws in all systems and giving the
manufactures 30 days and then

811
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,210
posting them publicly and their number
places that do that now

812
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:57,520
but I think this group specifically has
lost the opportunity to be a major force

813
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,640
in cleaning up the environment and I
also like

814
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,390
to fight spam killers on I mean I'm
talking guys who will identify spam

815
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,600
killers by the physical address and then
go in and burn down the place

816
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:12,260
of you know home

817
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:15,630
cuz allot a good that could be done
there I had get I get a hundred and

818
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,680
eighty-five thousand spam a day

819
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,850
and it's cleaned in Sweden and I see
what's left over arm

820
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:26,290
but i thinkI

821
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,290
honesty got belief

822
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:32,400
that collective intelligence the wisdom
of the crowds

823
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,750
enabled by the internet and the social

824
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:40,590
arm networking that can occur as a
result of the Internet I think

825
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:44,270
in the next three to 10 years we're
going to see an incredible difference to

826
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,310
the point

827
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,700
that people like dick cheney can be
tarred and feathered

828
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:52,390
on in cyberspace

829
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:55,740
in cyberspace and one other things and
I'm very excited about to come to you in

830
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,510
a second

831
00:50:56,510 --> 00:51:01,960
watching some very excited about is the
concept retrospective indictment

832
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:07,720
last spoke about this very briefly the
other day in 1975 to 1979 the US Senate

833
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,550
the White House new

834
00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:12,610
everything they needed to know about
peak oil nd

835
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,120
and they chose to cover it up in order
to keep the bribes coming in in order to

836
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,600
keep american citizens

837
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,020
you know for happy and free gas and and
so without that was treason

838
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,800
I think one of the things that we need
to do is start to retrospectively

839
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,050
evaluate every government decision in
the past 20 years

840
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:33,090
and we need to literally and I'm not
saying hang them jail them whatever

841
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,180
we need to literally out every asshole
in the US government in the past 20

842
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,530
years

843
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:43,100
Cloquet and

844
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,730
and I don't mean send them to jail you

845
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:53,790
you polled

846
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:57,070
only only only only

847
00:51:57,070 --> 00:52:00,560
so you know i i really believe in
campaign reform and I think the big

848
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,410
problem that we have right now

849
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:05,430
is that the people have gotten lazy

850
00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:08,580
and they elect someone and they let him
go when they forget about it

851
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,920
mom one of the interesting things about
the internet is

852
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,280
and I love the book no logo are because
it talks about people attaching

853
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,190
themselves leach like to corporations

854
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:23,670
and basically holding those corporations
accountable

855
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:27,650
it's not the government's surveillance a
view that we need to worry about its our

856
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,250
surveillance to the government

857
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,460
that has enormous potential

858
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,590
Robert I have to enter up for a moment I
just like to remind our esteemed guests

859
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,660
that if they would take a look at the
back page of our program

860
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:46,259
a we we ask that everybody respects that
no excessive heckling rule

861
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,260
and I if another incident happens again
we're gonna have to get up this early

862
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,410
Lisa beat the shit out of them okay go
on

863
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,810
next I'd be happy to throw out the
actress but we give everybody a chance

864
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:02,259
that's right ankle and no one has
identified my son yet so I don't have to

865
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,650
give away the keys to the Jaguar

866
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,849
this was actually Emmanuel's first prize
in 1994 for those of you that are new to

867
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:11,239
this

868
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:15,380
and then the person that won the keys to
the jaguar s cool where's the Jaguar

869
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,319
Emmanuel said I don't know if if if

870
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:24,259
if has gone on not really gonna try to
flame entering like that as a not

871
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:25,819
interested in leasing with

872
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:28,959
know yet on the and the entertainment
you know which is pretty said

873
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:32,939
should while the basic question is gonna
feel more the geek n/a

874
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:36,449
you know the because the conference
anyway how do you suggest the same got

875
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:37,650
mr Morton source

876
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:42,099
open source sources out on the icy any
other say the IC's gotta scrutinize all

877
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:43,979
these threat streams that are coming in
from

878
00:53:43,979 --> 00:53:48,529
God knows where how do you say that we
scrutinize unsubstantiated reporting

879
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:52,359
for people walking on the first time in
CA this is gonna happen

880
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:56,949
thanks well I actually believe

881
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,979
that the one really great thing about
the intelligence community is what's

882
00:53:59,979 --> 00:54:02,130
called a proven process intelligence

883
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,369
thats requirements definition what you
need to know

884
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:08,689
arm collection management

885
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:12,629
farming out source discovery and
validation

886
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:17,729
which is very important multi-source
fusion and then compelling presentation

887
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:19,849
one other problems we have today

888
00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:23,249
is that all the departments of
government that are not supported by the

889
00:54:23,249 --> 00:54:24,059
CIA

890
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:27,999
in fact actually everyone texan is
ignoring the CIA today including the

891
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:28,609
pentagon

892
00:54:28,609 --> 00:54:33,259
most especially but the key here is the
government is on automatic pilot

893
00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:37,529
it's it's a bureaucracy now I believe

894
00:54:37,529 --> 00:54:41,989
that sources that come in with
unsubstantiated information

895
00:54:41,989 --> 00:54:45,369
need to be put in context among other
reasons I'm sponsoring

896
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:49,619
or hoping the sponsor fifty-state
community intelligence centers and

897
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,269
networks

898
00:54:50,269 --> 00:54:53,589
is because I believe that there's an
awful lot of information that can come

899
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:54,529
from the bottom up

900
00:54:54,529 --> 00:54:59,199
that needs to be evaluated at the county
level and the state level

901
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:03,140
and at the same time the center's
conservative channels for global reality

902
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:06,199
coming down the school house is in
chambers of commerce and so forth

903
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:11,199
the bottom line here is there is nothing
about intelligence it says it has to be

904
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:12,849
secret

905
00:55:12,849 --> 00:55:16,400
if you if you understand intelligence
says decision support

906
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,749
with the proven process if intelligence
as the way in which you do

907
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:25,599
decision support then you realize that
there's an awful lot that we can do

908
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,779
to improve government at all three
levels to improve

909
00:55:28,779 --> 00:55:31,849
corporations i mean i I personally
believe the corporation should no longer

910
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:32,729
be

911
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,839
independent personalities I think that
the

912
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,959
individual managers need to be held
accountable for corporations and I think

913
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:40,219
this

914
00:55:40,219 --> 00:55:47,219
the I don't know if I've answered your
question

915
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:52,308
but I do believe the major change the
two major changes I wanna make in the US

916
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:55,380
intelligence community and I say this
with humility because no one is ever

917
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,849
good fucking let me do this

918
00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:01,619
mom are number one and I've written this
in Forks dot com

919
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:05,029
we need to start with what we can know
from open sources and what we can learn

920
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:05,849
from others

921
00:56:05,849 --> 00:56:09,289
the US intelligence community starts
with what it can see from a satellite

922
00:56:09,289 --> 00:56:11,029
and what its agents can steal

923
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:15,989
and it tries to divine reality without
any attention to what other people can

924
00:56:15,989 --> 00:56:16,429
tell

925
00:56:16,429 --> 00:56:21,749
home so the number 12 start with open
source number to go

926
00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:25,609
with the swedes call m4 I S
multinational multi-agency

927
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:27,328
multi-disciplinary multi to me

928
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:32,539
information-sharing sharing not secrecy
is the operative paradigm for the 21st

929
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:33,089
century

930
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:37,049
the intelligence community still doesn't
get it possess your question

931
00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:40,630
UK next um

932
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:44,099
I was curious about your opinion on a
different matter its

933
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,339
sort of related to the 911 stuff but um

934
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:51,029
what is your opinion on al Qaeda as an
organization

935
00:56:51,029 --> 00:56:55,779
hmm um because if you see I'm sure
you've heard of the power

936
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:00,699
nightmares the white the power
nightmares I'm sorry the web the power

937
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:03,939
nightmares oh yea and nice movie someone
gave me a

938
00:57:03,939 --> 00:57:07,408
DVDs and I'm curious what you think I've

939
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:11,429
the idea that that al Qaeda politics the
fears Association

940
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:14,509
right well actual although

941
00:57:14,509 --> 00:57:19,689
I believe my CA colleagues when they say
they did not find ok I did directly

942
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:22,949
on when we did Afghanistan

943
00:57:22,949 --> 00:57:26,099
we really did not see

944
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:31,380
we did not understand the power of three
different things

945
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,429
we didn't understand that we were
unleashing

946
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:37,499
a Pandora's box of islamic
fundamentalism we were basically

947
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,699
training them and how to take down the
Soviet Union

948
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:44,329
a power they've been turned on us number
two

949
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:47,339
we didn't understand the value of the
Tolly bonds

950
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:51,429
repressing the opium production in
Afghanistan

951
00:57:51,429 --> 00:57:55,989
under US leadership Afghanistan is now
responsible for eighty percent of the

952
00:57:55,989 --> 00:57:57,739
opium in the world

953
00:57:57,739 --> 00:58:01,909
the warlords are rich beyond the wildest
dreams in Pakistan is processing this

954
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:03,729
opium to level 4

955
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:07,439
and making a bundle which help sponsor
its nuclear program

956
00:58:07,439 --> 00:58:10,519
on we also didn't understand the

957
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:14,989
relationship between wall street drugs
drugs provide Wall Street with its

958
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:16,429
liquidity

959
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:19,739
and there is in fact they were courted
visit love the chairman of the

960
00:58:19,739 --> 00:58:21,179
Securities Exchange Commission

961
00:58:21,179 --> 00:58:25,359
to Columbia in what is called the
ultimate cold call

962
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:28,729
he went down to see the leaders in the
far to suggest that the investor drug

963
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:30,329
money on wall street

964
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:35,709
this is about is fucking immoral as I
can think

965
00:58:35,709 --> 00:58:40,219
case or more that you want PMI my
question was more along the lines a

966
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:44,900
its organizational structure are I think
I'll kate is an idea rather than an

967
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,909
organization

968
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:48,949
and it's an idea that has blossom

969
00:58:48,949 --> 00:58:52,640
a southern Thailand Indonesia the
Philippines India

970
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,308
at a what those eight bombs in India
really fucked up american call centres

971
00:58:57,309 --> 00:59:01,890
and ok eight is not stupid they are
going after the call centers they're

972
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,328
going after the foreign

973
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:06,979
up pipelines they may one day go after
water

974
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:11,349
on what we've gotten ourselves into is
the situation a hundred years 6 front

975
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:12,289
war

976
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:15,679
in which America that good is no longer
a defense

977
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:21,489
because we've given up on american good
on we have given these people

978
00:59:21,489 --> 00:59:25,689
from yet I wish I hope column

979
00:59:25,689 --> 00:59:28,699
you know when you live it is when you
live in a glass house it's a really bad

980
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:31,109
idea to throw stones

981
00:59:31,109 --> 00:59:34,189
do you think the London bombings were
associated

982
00:59:34,189 --> 00:59:38,308
I think the London moms you workers
bowler and that's what'll Scotland Yard

983
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:43,109
I think iran is running rings around Rs
Iran they're not racquets they are

984
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:45,788
really smart dudes

985
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:49,579
and by the way I think most Iran is
about nationalism not about threatening

986
00:59:49,579 --> 00:59:52,749
the United States

987
00:59:52,749 --> 00:59:55,939
next hey yeah hey

988
00:59:55,939 --> 00:59:58,899
on you talk a lot more in this
conference about Dick Cheney in the role

989
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,199
you think he's played

990
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:03,499
on your mark in 2004 the you actually
thought he was going to be gone

991
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:07,039
as bushes running mate in 2004 election
why do you think it didn't try I

992
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:13,099
underestimated bush's stupidity

993
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:16,279
a on you talk a lot more in this
conference about Dick Cheney

994
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:19,609
the role you think he's played your mark
in 2004 the

995
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:23,299
actually thought he was going to be gone
as bushes running mate in 2004 election

996
01:00:23,299 --> 01:00:24,499
why do you think it didn't

997
01:00:24,499 --> 01:00:29,199
I i underestimated bush's stupidity

998
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:33,959
I'm serious mom

999
01:00:33,959 --> 01:00:38,529
it's just unbelievable and if you read
the book 1 percent doctrine one of the

1000
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:42,849
things that Ron Suskind does very well
as he documents how Dick Cheney has

1001
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:44,939
experimented

1002
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:48,649
with dictating policy without consulting
the president all the way back to

1003
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,509
president ford

1004
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:53,569
Dick Cheney has a track record

1005
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:58,669
of basically for sure bring the power of
the president he serves

1006
01:00:58,669 --> 01:01:02,929
and unfortunately george bush is just
fucking dumb enough to let dick cheney

1007
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:08,969
do a lot of damage

1008
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:12,809
I'm still to think differently for being
here once again

1009
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:15,909
you expect you guys that throw me out
with my son I'll be back and you won't

1010
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:17,169
know who he is

1011
01:01:17,169 --> 01:01:20,199
of at any rate have two brief questions

1012
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:23,969
that's right home for small I'm I was
wearing if you could

1013
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:27,769
sure any thoughts usurping you might
have as to why

1014
01:01:27,769 --> 01:01:31,049
roughly $400 plus stones were found on
the

1015
01:01:31,049 --> 01:01:35,339
HSBC building near Ground Zero

1016
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:39,788
you know tipper at this past February to

1017
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:44,069
no I have no idea okay that there was
another local media ABC CBS and

1018
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:47,249
BC don't know okay that's fair

1019
01:01:47,249 --> 01:01:50,769
it's proper for are also I was wondering
if you

1020
01:01:50,769 --> 01:01:53,920
could start to me your thoughts

1021
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,989
on the importance love net-centric or
network-centric warfare

1022
01:01:57,989 --> 01:02:01,269
purses urban warfare in the coming
decades

1023
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:07,739
will what I think you want to do there
is pointing to max man wearing

1024
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:10,929
I believe that belief systems

1025
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:14,199
or the seventh generation of warfare and

1026
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:18,650
America has been largely oblivious to
belief systems for the last 20 years

1027
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:20,019
actually for ever

1028
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:23,689
on we completely miss the fact that from
1988

1029
01:02:23,689 --> 01:02:27,428
onwards the saudi Arabia's were
sponsoring a very virulent form

1030
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:30,759
extremist Islamism

1031
01:02:30,759 --> 01:02:33,920
and Americans you simply not paying
attention

1032
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,369
are we are not focusing on this

1033
01:02:37,369 --> 01:02:40,989
and I will tell you i mean Howard bloom
who lives here in New York is a friend

1034
01:02:40,989 --> 01:02:44,079
of mine and he's written a wonderful
book called global brain

1035
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,859
as well as loose a first principle

1036
01:02:47,859 --> 01:02:52,189
if all boils down to national power is
based

1037
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:56,359
on the cumulative brainpower up its
citizens

1038
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:59,469
combined with a cumulative

1039
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:04,599
aggregate understanding of what everyone
else is brain power is thinking

1040
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:07,719
in we have really blown it I mean

1041
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:11,009
1 I've the sub theme is one on the list
that I have on Amazon is about

1042
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:15,179
anti-americanism in blowback

1043
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:19,509
I I used to think the bush-cheney
administration was stupid now I think

1044
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:20,809
they're just venal

1045
01:03:20,809 --> 01:03:24,650
and they actually have a strategy and
they know what they're doing

1046
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:28,630
they're getting exactly what they want
on

1047
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:32,279
put belief systems his work comes down
to

1048
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:36,319
and if we can't speak all these
languages and if we give our citizenship

1049
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:39,909
await every asshole comes in refuses to
learn english

1050
01:03:39,909 --> 01:03:45,599
them fuck ass you know we're not paying
attention to our national integrity to

1051
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:46,959
our national character

1052
01:03:46,959 --> 01:03:49,909
you may not like this but I think we
need to bring back universal service

1053
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,279
with one distinction

1054
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:54,420
you can choose the Peace Corps over the
army are

1055
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,369
i doing that when we know when I was a
marine we had dark green Marines in like

1056
01:03:58,369 --> 01:03:59,630
three marines

1057
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:02,789
on and that was an extremely important

1058
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:07,889
coming of age for me on this country has
lost its cohesion

1059
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:12,059
so I think belief systems is where
net-centric net-centric warfare it's not

1060
01:04:12,059 --> 01:04:13,059
about computers

1061
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:16,569
you know any more I can do without a
computer it's about thinking

1062
01:04:16,569 --> 01:04:19,920
it's about understanding it's about
knowing intuitively what the right thing

1063
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,150
to do is

1064
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:24,179
we've lost there's a book called the
cheating culture

1065
01:04:24,179 --> 01:04:27,249
america is a sheeting culture today

1066
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:31,019
everybody they can she's

1067
01:04:31,019 --> 01:04:35,150
and that is a prescription force
self-immolation

1068
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:39,799
on in every possible respect

1069
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:45,880
why

1070
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:49,219
he saying wrong collapse from the inside
out I agree we are collapsing from the

1071
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,269
inside out

1072
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:54,499
on the only good thing about bush and I
said this in May of 2004 when I said why

1073
01:04:54,499 --> 01:04:57,219
would vote for bush instead to carry

1074
01:04:57,219 --> 01:05:00,219
apart from his wife in his haircut are

1075
01:05:00,219 --> 01:05:03,880
carry would be a placebo Bush is
radicalizing I had no idea how

1076
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:05,719
radicalizing he would be

1077
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:09,409
but I on a stick I believe that Bush is
a gift from heaven

1078
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:13,049
because he is pissing off so many people
we might actually finally get our act

1079
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:13,929
together again

1080
01:05:13,929 --> 01:05:18,709
things still yessir

1081
01:05:18,709 --> 01:05:22,219

wanna miss us

1082

to it

1083
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:31,859
nevermind who's alive isn't it from
before I

1084
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:35,219
your where they are tough reasons that I
come to hope every year

1085
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:39,859
oh that's sad for god Bless You Think

are

1089
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:50,650
us believe on for two things or for

1090
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,659
at least two things one of which is not
building

1091
01:05:53,659 --> 01:05:57,029
a kinda database %uh manufacturing flaws

1092
01:05:57,029 --> 01:06:00,349
and holding manufactures accountable and
also

1093
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:05,150
for not making spammer assassins as well
as spam assessing

1094
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:09,409
bomb I wanna change that I don't want to
come to the next hope and have

1095
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:14,369
you chastise us for the same thing can
we open some kinda way a dialogue say we

1096
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:16,099
can communicate to you

1097
01:06:16,099 --> 01:06:21,409
more than once every two years my email
is bear at OS s dot net and if you put

1098
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:24,679
in the subject line hope I will read

1099
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:29,019
any answer it thank you

1100
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:33,209
I i have two questions the first one is
I'm can you identify

1101
01:06:33,209 --> 01:06:36,489
I guess the top series jolt call

1102
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:40,670
what is it to hang on a second I have to
evaluate this thing that I've been given

1103
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:43,949
what is this is

1104
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:48,819
a cheap beer I'm holding out for the
good stuff

1105
01:06:48,819 --> 01:06:52,069
Fuego life thank you

1106
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:55,489
could you just recap for us who you
think the top three you're not going to

1107
01:06:55,489 --> 01:06:58,849
get me drunk

1108
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:02,900
up the top three elected or appointed
good guys

1109
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:07,769
within the government currently if they
exist and the same question I have is

1110
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:11,139
at what point do you think you'll reach
the

1111
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:14,769
the level where you will become victim
other frame job or an engineered

1112
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:18,789
accident

1113
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:25,789
you it fifth

1114
01:07:26,219 --> 01:07:30,639
12 let me take us one at a time arm

1115
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:35,789
I don't know the top people in
government perversely well enough to

1116
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:39,130
to say good things about them I think
that

1117
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:43,729
John McCain used to be one of my top
people as did colin powell

1118
01:07:43,729 --> 01:07:46,829
but John McCain has become a born-again
bushel file

1119
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:51,759
and I think he's too willing to sell out
to the evangelical lunatics

1120
01:07:51,759 --> 01:07:55,769
in order to be the Republican candidate
but I admire john mccain

1121
01:07:55,769 --> 01:07:59,239
very much as I continue to admire colin
powell

1122
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:02,619
on and if colin power to make a
resurgence

1123
01:08:02,619 --> 01:08:07,369
and come back and basically say I
screwed up I would trust him

1124
01:08:07,369 --> 01:08:10,559
to be a good person

1125
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,009
tony's any Marine Corps general tony's
any

1126
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:17,408
is a jam waiting to be discovered

1127
01:08:17,408 --> 01:08:22,278
America tony's any type of me
relationships matter

1128
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:27,679
and I i have a very low social IQ

1129
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,440
and I'm telling you he really made me
understand that you cannot

1130
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:37,130
be in relationship with nations unless
you're in a relationship with people

1131
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:41,769
at the individual level at every level
this nation so tony's any I think it's

1132
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:43,559
my vote for top

1133
01:08:43,559 --> 01:08:46,909
candidate for the future on

1134
01:08:46,908 --> 01:08:50,750
everyone else the losers

1135
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,899
the they're basically prostitutes that
have sold out

1136
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:59,929
to keep their jobs and I'm very
interested in seeing if 2006 causes

1137
01:08:59,929 --> 01:09:03,618
kind of a turnover the incumbent sees
and I don't know

1138
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:06,738
now as far as getting an accident I
think

1139
01:09:06,739 --> 01:09:10,849
that the Dick Cheney's in the world
think that

1140
01:09:10,849 --> 01:09:15,759
I might reveal effect on many sure they
know who actually I know the normal life

1141
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:21,658
but I have challenged the Deni to an
intelligence tool

1142
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:26,960
through press releases he very wisely
chose not to answer

1143
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,939
but I one sexual before the Aspen brown
commission with six phone calls

1144
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:36,099
I have faxed the White House and on my
website you'll find

1145
01:09:36,099 --> 01:09:39,159
a couple of letters that I sent the
condi rice. early on

1146
01:09:39,158 --> 01:09:42,768
Cup love them responding to a question
she had in one of them tiring I mean

1147
01:09:42,769 --> 01:09:47,250
when Condi Rice said that the scent is
treason

1148
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:50,658
I instantly knew she was an idiot

1149
01:09:50,658 --> 01:09:54,440
in the bottom line fundamental sense
that the work okay I me to say that the

1150
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:56,250
scent is treason

1151
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:59,679
is selling out in the worst possible way

1152
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:02,980
I don't think they'll have an accident I
think I'm getting much healthier 54

1153
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,119
years old

1154
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:08,839
II during class i'm on medication it
helps

1155
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:14,360
and I have a loving family in a saint
for life

1156
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:18,339
so I don't think I'll have an accident I
think you guys are more dangerous than I

1157
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,659
am

1158
01:10:19,659 --> 01:10:22,900
actually just have one quick follow-up
question that if you could

1159
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:26,800
pic anyone appointed position within the
government

1160
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,989
to be appointed to what would it be I
would be to mourn

1161
01:10:30,989 --> 01:10:34,710
between being the president's 24/7 valet

1162
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,130
arm so that I can literally be

1163
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:43,159
I wanna hear and see everything he hears
and sees and then whisper in his ear

1164
01:10:43,159 --> 01:10:47,219
as he goes to his wife at night arm

1165
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:51,360
why now the foot you know what the
football is bullshit we don't we're not

1166
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:52,759
even sure it'll work

1167
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,860
arm

1168
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:00,839
although I have considered be Director
of National Intelligence and I would

1169
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,099
I would probably like that because it's
a massive slush fund

1170
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:09,050
that I could cut by two-thirds and do a
lot a good elsewhere

1171
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:12,429
might dream in life is to be director
the open-source agency

1172
01:11:12,429 --> 01:11:15,760
but with a difference I want the
open-source agency and I don't think

1173
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:19,340
this will happen but I want the
open-source agency to be a fourth branch

1174
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,040
of government

1175
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:24,040
that is independent of both the
legislature in the white house that has

1176
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,790
a budget that is a one percent to the
National

1177
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:31,739
disposable income on that has a director
appointed for life that has a board of

1178
01:11:31,739 --> 01:11:33,809
overseers that are retired

1179
01:11:33,809 --> 01:11:37,489
presidents speakers at the house

1180
01:11:37,489 --> 01:11:40,500
leaders our leaders whatever you know a
bob dole

1181
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:44,219
I me basically my dream would be
clinton-dole arm

1182
01:11:44,219 --> 01:11:48,409
the ghost of tip o'neill and Sandra Day
O'Connor is the chairman

1183
01:11:48,409 --> 01:11:52,659
on and the job this agencies to do with
CIA is supposed to do

1184
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:56,079
the truth shall make you free CIA has
blown

1185
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:00,409
I think the open source intelligence
agency is capable of making america free

1186
01:12:00,409 --> 01:12:04,719
by making public intelligence a reality
and I mean that down to the schoolhouse

1187
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:07,880
and Chamber of Commerce level

1188
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:13,860
I will never get my dream I don't think

1189
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:17,659
it's my pleasure you know I think you
actually I just

1190
01:12:17,659 --> 01:12:20,929
answered my question I was actually
going to ask the down

1191
01:12:20,929 --> 01:12:24,940
the open source center at the CIA which
was created a few months ago I have an

1192
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,139
answer your question

1193
01:12:26,139 --> 01:12:31,050
is a crock of shit I mean we're talkin
not just lipstick on a pig but really

1194
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:32,159
badly applied

1195
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:38,098
ugly lipstick have the wrong colour

1196
01:12:38,099 --> 01:12:42,969
ok now you hate in my quest they have
seven people

1197
01:12:42,969 --> 01:12:47,800
with bad Arabic following Arabic web
sites

1198
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,130
seven people how does that work

1199
01:12:52,130 --> 01:12:56,239
because the CIA security people wanna
live eighty recruit anybody was parents

1200
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:01,540
living overseas

1201
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:05,690
look I'm in a dogfight congressman
Simmons who who I've supported for many

1202
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:07,280
years

1203
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:11,159
has proposed legislation I may or may
not publish my web sites and I'm

1204
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:14,829
one is permission first but he is
proposed legislation that would convert

1205
01:13:14,829 --> 01:13:17,139
the open source center

1206
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:20,179
which is the foreign broadcast
information service that has fought me

1207
01:13:20,179 --> 01:13:21,900
for 18 years

1208
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:25,260
into the open source agency now meet a
some

1209
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:30,050
when you promote a CIA culture with CIA
security officers and see a legal and

1210
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,409
CIA personnel and

1211
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:36,089
CA mindsets to that point and you leave
it under the Director of National

1212
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:38,519
Intelligence

1213
01:13:38,519 --> 01:13:42,949
have you guys already heard the analogy
about the throughway camera

1214
01:13:42,949 --> 01:13:46,929
alright real quick in the innovator
solution wonderful book he talks about

1215
01:13:46,929 --> 01:13:50,550
how when the throw a camera the
disposable camera was invented

1216
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:53,989
the inventors went to the went to the

1217
01:13:53,989 --> 01:13:58,280
camera shops and try to to get them to
sell the last thing they want to do is

1218
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,079
sell cheap cameras

1219
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,380
so they went to the grocery store K the
open-source

1220
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:06,510
agencies disposable camera

1221
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:10,940
up the information communications H the
last people in the world you wanna have

1222
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,869
run it

1223
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:14,900
are the assholes who have sixty billion
dollars a year

1224
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:19,780
for secrets so I am working up on the
senate side

1225
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:23,530
are countering legislation and these two
competing legislation

1226
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:26,690
go to conference and hopefully somewhere
in there comes out right

1227
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:30,260
but I'm working up carry legislation
which is showing the chairman of all the

1228
01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:32,619
different jurisdictions have the senate

1229
01:14:32,619 --> 01:14:35,780
that what they really need is an
open-source agency that is completely

1230
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:36,449
independent

1231
01:14:36,449 --> 01:14:40,110
the spice that is able to provide
high-quality

1232
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:44,909
public intelligence to agriculture
energy environment EPA you know

1233
01:14:44,909 --> 01:14:49,228
you see where I'm going with this okay
the disposable camera cannot be

1234
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:52,849
controlled by the spies I have been a
spy I know how fucked up it is

1235
01:14:52,849 --> 01:14:59,849
%uh real quick and then we'll go here

1236
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:04,159
well that sixty billion that's my best
estimate somewhere between 50 and 70 I

1237
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,469
think sixty is is

1238
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:09,519
is actually low that is the total budget

1239
01:15:09,519 --> 01:15:14,079
love the National Reconnaissance Office
which builds really shitty satellites

1240
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:18,900
over a long period of time the National
Geospatial agency which is spending all

1241
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,420
of its money trying to see

1242
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,929
you can understand the National
Geospatial agency spent most of its

1243
01:15:23,929 --> 01:15:25,979
money trying to convert

1244
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:29,469
postage stamps from precision satellites
in the white area

1245
01:15:29,469 --> 01:15:32,769
maps this is not a prescription for
success

1246
01:15:32,769 --> 01:15:38,079
arm national security agencies in the
1970s I think personally this is wild

1247
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:39,699
speculation I think lesson

1248
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:43,460
20 percent other information is actually
on line they've got all these reels

1249
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:48,219
of tape and stuff there linguists are
enlisted people

1250
01:15:48,219 --> 01:15:51,800
at the two to three love on a scale five
okay

1251
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,110
we're not talkin serious here sixty
billion dollars

1252
01:15:55,110 --> 01:15:58,509
on intelligence is bullshit and six
hundred billion dollars on

1253
01:15:58,510 --> 01:16:01,760
a heavy metal military is also bullshit

1254
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,739
a you talked about how somewhere in here
I have to go to the bathroom

1255
01:16:05,739 --> 01:16:08,809
you talked about how lack of
accountability

1256
01:16:08,809 --> 01:16:12,380
nevermind if

1257
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:15,579
you've talked about the lack thereof
accountability in government yes

1258
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:20,308
and corporate accountability so what
would you suggest

1259
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:23,920
I mean are we ever gonna we gotta get to
a point where essentially the public

1260
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,530
house to engage

1261
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:29,400
and information warfare against its own
government

1262
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:33,110
and against corporations in order to
make them accountable

1263
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:37,320
I don't mind either formation were for
quality information peacekeeping

1264
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:42,228
what okay why its if I could just
quickly related experience I had

1265
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:43,229
recently I i

1266
01:16:43,229 --> 01:16:47,389
what are you going and which I tried to
make a corporation accountable for the

1267
01:16:47,389 --> 01:16:49,659
service that I was paying for

1268
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:52,719
I was basically threatened with being
arrested

1269
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:58,019
by met by airing the fact that I was
unhappy with the service I was getting

1270
01:16:58,019 --> 01:17:04,090
that I paid for so I've I I find that
there seems to be this sort of pulling

1271
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:09,739
corporate bowling going on I'm when you
try to make them accountable to

1272
01:17:09,739 --> 01:17:13,800
you know that what is also be selling
you um

1273
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,059
but it's up to a level that I its I'm
not as I'm older than

1274
01:17:18,059 --> 01:17:21,340
you from each good go quickly yeah but I

1275
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:25,159
but I'm just saying it's a level that I
is is disturbing me more now than it has

1276
01:17:25,159 --> 01:17:26,210
in the past

1277
01:17:26,210 --> 01:17:30,040
and the other things I'm curious about
your thoughts your opinions on richard

1278
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,960
clark

1279
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:37,559
and north korea or number one i think
thats selective purchasing

1280
01:17:37,559 --> 01:17:40,780
is the single best thing we've got going
for us

1281
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:45,268
and I credit that idea to know logo are
but I think so minutes great

1282
01:17:45,269 --> 01:17:48,429
is that is the installment stahlman I
reviewed as I read his book in the

1283
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,170
morning and listen to in the afternoon
and then there was absolutely great

1284
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,320
don't become captive to the beast

1285
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,599
are my the hell do we need ten brings to
catch up

1286
01:17:56,599 --> 01:18:00,739
arm you know their their selective
purchasing injudicious you something I

1287
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:04,309
love the wired magazine article about
how RFID is gonna get to the point where

1288
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:05,179

1290
01:18:08,969 --> 01:18:12,329

getting there on

1291
01:18:12,329 --> 01:18:17,449
no dick Clark Dick Clark is an extremely
intelligent world-class asshole who did

1292
01:18:17,449 --> 01:18:18,479
his job

1293
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,300
are and I respect him very much and his
book was very good

1294
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,550
and Dick Clark was ignored

1295
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:29,619
and denigrated by Bill Clinton and

1296
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:34,820
whoever bill clinton's vice president
was

1297
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:38,130
who was it

1298
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:42,659
all no no no he sponsored the
legislation that name to the Internet

1299
01:18:42,659 --> 01:18:44,170
okay anyway outdoor

1300
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:48,389
on you know I mean these guys that
madeleine albright tony lake is a moron

1301
01:18:48,389 --> 01:18:53,820
arm these people tony lake didn't write
his book on six threats until he was

1302
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:56,949
leaving the white house and decided he
had to make a name for himself

1303
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:01,889
arm these people were so out of touch
with reality was unbelievable

1304
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:05,540
and just in passing I will mention the
bill clinton got impeached for lying

1305
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,969
about a blowjob

1306
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:11,650
and we still haven't impeached anyone
here for stealing two elections starting

1307
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:12,949
elective war

1308
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:16,110
lying to Congress the United Nations in
the public in one to two other high

1309
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:17,570
crimes and misdemeanors

1310
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:23,290
this country is totally out of whack on

1311
01:19:23,290 --> 01:19:28,250
north korea is not a threat and neither
is Cuban

1312
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:33,309
arm as a year ago the Treasury
Department Head 90 cases on terrorism

1313
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:35,540
and 900 cases on

1314
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:40,619
exports to Cuba okay the fastest way to
take your north korea

1315
01:19:40,619 --> 01:19:43,929
and cuba is to open the borders and

1316
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:46,940
shut down the idiot exiles in Miami

1317
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,579
okay com uncommon and yes

1318
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:54,380
one comment to questions like

1319
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:59,559
great hang on you guys are let's do you
three guys real quick

1320
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:03,159
and then I'm gonna go to the bathroom
because what goes in must come out

1321
01:20:03,159 --> 01:20:06,449
and then I can either stand up here I
could do it privately

1322
01:20:06,449 --> 01:20:10,800
you know whatever you guys want I want
to be as helpful to you as possible

1323
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,570
alright I'll try and be as brief as it
can the common for stuff manual

1324
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:17,599
wrote in his travelogue to cuba that

1325
01:20:17,599 --> 01:20:21,280
the same thing you just expressed that
the best thing to do would be to

1326
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,840
open the book open the borders cubans be
the first guy to buy one of those 54

1327
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,199
chevys

1328
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,809
absolutely um second question that or
not this really

1329
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:34,439
and how to go about saying this but I
once

1330
01:20:34,439 --> 01:20:37,679
I've considered actually running for
politics except the sheer amount of

1331
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,780
bullshit that involved as

1332
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:42,880
as running as an independent or the fact
that there would be

1333
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,909
be some sort of party influence in
running as

1334
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:50,409
party candidates makes it really
impossible

1335
01:20:50,409 --> 01:20:53,598
for its someone who's not a pinhead to

1336
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,400
to be TV be on the ballot for the
pinheads you really if you're not doing

1337
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,340
so how would someone go about like do
and I i don't have an answer but I will

1338
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:04,479
tell you that there's a book called the
power in the ambition which which

1339
01:21:04,479 --> 01:21:08,540
persuaded me I never wanted to run for
office at least under the circumstances

1340
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:11,679
the power in the ambition is about the
way in which newt Gingrich said about

1341
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:14,119
destroying speaker wright

1342
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:17,639
on it was a very to liberate
assassination attempt

1343
01:21:17,639 --> 01:21:20,920
that succeeded on the other thing that
book taught me

1344
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,619
is that our congressmen don't really
work for us they spend three-quarters

1345
01:21:24,619 --> 01:21:29,040
to four-fifths love their time with
their hand out as prostitutes

1346
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,599
on and that's not good on

1347
01:21:33,599 --> 01:21:37,989
I will go back to to Thomas Kuhn
structure Scientific Revolution you

1348
01:21:37,989 --> 01:21:41,360
would have thought that 9/11 would be a
paradigm shift you thought that Katrina

1349
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:42,489
would be in

1350
01:21:42,489 --> 01:21:46,409
would be a paradigm shift but it wasn't
I think what we're going to need

1351
01:21:46,409 --> 01:21:51,159
is a constellation love nuclear van on
the East Coast

1352
01:21:51,159 --> 01:21:54,369
Los Angeles falling into the sea which
might be a good thing

1353
01:21:54,369 --> 01:21:58,540
armed Texas running out of water

1354
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:02,329
yeah I mean we had these things are all
coming at us when they hear this

1355
01:22:02,329 --> 01:22:06,849
I don't know but I have a real belief in
the research and see if the american

1356
01:22:06,849 --> 01:22:07,699
people

1357
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:11,920
arm and so I'm kinda thrown out my hands

1358
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,829
and i'm glad I have a job that pays
enough to put food on the table

1359
01:22:15,829 --> 01:22:19,679
all but I'm very very upset about the
larger context and i really believe the

1360
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:21,579
United Nations has it right

1361
01:22:21,579 --> 01:22:24,500
on these 10 threats and it should be
significant to you that the US

1362
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,320
government doesn't give a shit about

1363
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,460
eight of the 10 threats and is using the
other two for the politics of fear

1364
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:33,710
and then my final question has to do
with one of those two quote-unquote

1365
01:22:33,710 --> 01:22:34,869
threats

1366
01:22:34,869 --> 01:22:38,299
um if magic

1367
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:41,780
where you are caught you have to call on
what would happen in Iraq how which

1368
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:45,719
what would you do and only like specific
just

1369
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:50,229
like it broadus what's this I will tell
you right now that based on my reading

1370
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:54,159
having not been in Iraq percy based my
extensive reading

1371
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:58,949
we Blue Rock when paul Bremer decided to
become the proconsul

1372
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:03,179
his first two decisions were 10 baskets
can be empowered to

1373
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:06,340
disband these hundreds of thousands of
people with rifles and leave them

1374
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:07,420
destitute

1375
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:11,090
how fucking stupid is that arm

1376
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:14,679
we lost a rock when we turn from
liberated occupier

1377
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:17,929
we lost a rock because president bush
and Dick Cheney

1378
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:22,590
didn't have the personal integrity to
listen to army general schlocky or

1379
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,320
whatever is

1380
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:27,768
is his name is who said we know how to
do peace

1381
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:31,139
transitions after war but we need this
and this and this

1382
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:34,790
and I'm very impressed by book called
the end of a rock in which

1383
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:39,059
Ahmed Chalabi who by the way was fired
by CA for being a thief and a liar

1384
01:23:39,059 --> 01:23:43,530
are Shalabi basically managed to sock
hop

1385
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:46,829
and I believe that Shalabi was an
Iranian asiana

1386
01:23:46,829 --> 01:23:50,219
influence and the best agency influence

1387
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:54,670
get to the morons with preconceived
notions and feed those notions

1388
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:58,199
so america was sucked into a rock I
imagine this we took care of

1389
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:01,670
Afghanistan and Iraq the two major
enemies of Iran

1390
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:04,719
and they haven't spent a dime okay

1391
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:09,809
how stupid can we be on night the guy in
the orchard is the last guy because I'm

1392
01:24:09,809 --> 01:24:11,000
fit to burst

1393
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,130
so to I'll take your question I go to
the bathroom into whatever you guys want
