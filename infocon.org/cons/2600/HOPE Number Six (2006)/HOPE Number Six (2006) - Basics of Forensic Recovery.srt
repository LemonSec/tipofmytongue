1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,350
and dragged

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:12,350
just a quick announcement Tian

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,440
amateur radio testing is still going on
on the first floor so if you're

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,090
interested in getting an amateur radio
license you can

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,180
I don't know what the test is like but
maybe you can cheat

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:32,250
I'm the next panel

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,220
is %ah basics the forensic recovery with
Cal over

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:43,220
who has a PHD I found out last night
thank you

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,699
thank you

10
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,980
hello okay yeah but in a bitchy anyone
these days

11
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:57,989
before I begin

12
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:02,530
I thought it would be nice to explain to
you my motivations and putting this

13
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,510
together the way I have

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,908
I'm gonna make a couple distinctions
maybe make you wherever

15
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:13,759
a field the hadn't heard of before as I
move closer to the mike

16
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,729
okay have

17
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,229
my thought is this might be useful to
you I hope you find it so

18
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,770
I'm not claiming to be the definitive
expert on any have

19
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,390
the items I discuss I know about them I
work with them I've worked with them for

20
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,920
years

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,080
I would be happy to answer questions in
detail or explain

22
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,280
yet I teach entire master's degree
courses in this

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,649
and I had to throw some material out so
if you feel like I've

24
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:43,280
oversimplified put things together that
maybe didn't see them going together

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,810
that way

26
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,860
pair with me ask questions I'd be happy
to answer

27
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,940
K

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,209
one other things they run into the
problem is I deal with two different

29
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:55,880
camps

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,798
I'm a professor of criminal justice my
primary job is to teach people who want

31
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,210
to become police officers

32
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,359
corporate security people a people who
found physics was in a challenge form so

33
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:10,200
they thought they going to criminal
justice

34
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,510
you name it okay

35
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,590
that side up the house

36
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,730
sees forensics is something very
different than what the computer science

37
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,840
I did how sees it as I also work with
our computer science was

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,010
faculty hands I am home have been in
this community

39
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,660
for a while 0 longer than I've been in
that community

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,400
but the point is we say the same word we
mean different things

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,730
forensics to the computer science I to
the house means

42
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,840
incident recovery means remediation it
means investigating the incident the

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,420
post-mortem analysis on the logs on the
ideas

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,269
whatever it takes to figure out what
happened forensics on the loss I to the

45
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:55,920
house

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,920
K you don't get to see what it means I
was at the house

47
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,358
K see

48
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,540
examination %uh Vincent a quickie
definition there right

49
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,209
just so we can move on to the legal side

50
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:17,510
it means literally belonging to courts
of justice if you think about the

51
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,478
forensics team in high school

52
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:23,949
they went out argued forensics is
pertaining to argument argument

53
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:28,560
in this context occurs in courts I'm
talking about the loss I definition a

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,320
forensics

55
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,180
some people used to call it static
forensics as opposed to network

56
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,350
forensics at terms loss currency because
our model is shifting to a more dynamic

57
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,790
recovery of data model so it's no longer
static

58
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,190
frankly because the systems are too
complex if you anybody's

59
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,478
tried to take down an 80 system with any
size Active Directory for those view

60
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,780
despise Microsoft you understand it's
really hard to do that with the static

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,350
model

62
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,930
it mean if the class will pay for that
do it but

63
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,609
very few people are willing to put up
with that kind of expense what you

64
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,419
people around with

65
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,540
bringing up a pet or a toy eighty system

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,259
so what I'm gonna be talking about his
legal forensics

67
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:10,229
under that definition have I really
apologize he came to hear about the

68
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:11,759
latest greatest way to parse logs

69
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,639
that's just how I am doing today I put
this thing here

70
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,989
and then Jojo its course and

71
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:25,500
a PowerPoint anyway this is probably
more pertinent

72
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,000
it's another legal definition forensic
engineering you know you can stretch it

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,430
a little bit and figure this is really
what we're talking about

74
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,610
practice by legally qualified
professional engineers

75
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,710
slash professional anything else
charlatans

76
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,090
who attended a course on the web call
themselves forensic experts you name it

77
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,360
who are experts in their field both by
education and experience

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,610
very important there in courts in what
I'm talking about is legally related so

79
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,759
you've got to understand the court
perspective you don't have to agree with

80
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,070
that

81
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,440
but I think it's really important to
understand the reality you're dealing

82
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,800
with

83
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,930
whether you agree with it or not effects
are more effective working

84
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,560
against it with it whatever if you
understand the terms

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,160
other people do and this is what I'm
presenting

86
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,020
and don't worry I will get to the
technical stuff

87
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,289
I this is the basic model this is

88
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,760
cold from about six different power
point presentations I've got

89
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,320
you know that I give during the course
of the year but right now

90
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,750
current practice is that static model
that was talking about you go out you

91
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,520
see is a drive you take it home yet
analyze it

92
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,530
you fill up lots of paperwork so
everybody knows what's going on where it

93
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,240
comes from

94
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,120
to the degree that the courts are
willing to trust you do the things

95
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,760
necessary to obtain that trust

96
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,690
and unlike you know the kind a
cryptographic solutions we're talking

97
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,530
about here and other panels

98
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,230
this is really just the documentation it
says you haven't screwed it up

99
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,090
through mishap there is an assumption
people testify in court

100
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,340
will be telling the truth especially the
experts that is part of why

101
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,540
the education experience the verifiable

102
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,110
credentials that you bring to the frenzy
processor so important

103
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,190
what you're doing is putting a
reputation up to understand as an expert

104
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,380
witness

105
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,430
in if the court doesn't find a credible
you're useless

106
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,740
and after that point if you don't know
what you're talking about you're useless

107
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,540
I you gotta have both somebody who has a
PhD in knows nothing in

108
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,420
believe it or not I know several I may
be one

109
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,670
but I contend otherwise in court

110
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,680
believe it or not those people you know

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,770
me get up on the stand they have that
initial

112
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,729
they get in the door basically I work
with the guy who has

113
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:43,800
and in this community for a long long
time

114
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,680
he is teaching me every day and I'm
learning and I'm I'm absolutely loving

115
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,470
the fact that picking up all these
tricks from him

116
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,850
in spite of the fact that I've been at
this for years I he has established his

117
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,820
credibility

118
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,139
by being an expert witness a number of
times he finished his bachelor's degree

119
00:06:59,139 --> 00:06:59,860
I wanna see

120
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,250
year ago I he has been testifying as an
expert witness based on his own merit

121
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,770
but the mistake many people make is
since you know

122
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,380
the you know something you believe
everyone else should know that you know

123
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,620
something

124
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,290
and here you stand around you talk about
people though okay you know what you're

125
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,419
talking about

126
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,440
I listen to you in court

127
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,790
you gotta build up a track record or get
through that initial gate

128
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,480
with education or experience right for
that reason

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,139
this field a friend's ex is heavily
dominated by former law enforcement

130
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,210
it is simply one of the best ways to get
experience in court

131
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,410
if you going in as a police officer is a
federal agent

132
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,100
to court testify work a number of cases

133
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,260
present yourself with a you know a
professional V type into these trainings

134
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,150
I've been to court this many times right
other courts on you say okay

135
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,110
I'm all ready to go with you doesn't
mean you know what you're talking about

136
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:54,949
but then again

137
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,840
it doesn't mean you don't know what
you're talking about anybody who thinks

138
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,760
that

139
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,199
police who investigated Peter Kramer
stupid well

140
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,160
you know you're living in a fantasy
world these people are highly skilled

141
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,180
and I'm not saying every copy me too
looks at a computer is gonna understand

142
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,970
the inner workings of it

143
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,060
but don't kid yourself there are people
out there who are really intelligent

144
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,530
and if applied themselves to this and
have done fantastically well

145
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,389
I have a lot of respect for those people
this I have a lot of respect for people

146
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:22,720
here in the crowd today

147
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,870
you know somebody I should have respect
for some know yet

148
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,180
but have that same respect for police
officers who are doing this training

149
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,880
inner conducting that business you may
end up working with them someday

150
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,909
different ethical fine they're they're
not that bad

151
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:45,909
nearby in that area it's okay

152
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,220
he just mention she will come for those
reading here J

153
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,410
absolutely get to know people invited to
2600 meetings

154
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:02,870
what everybody get real quiet neck like
they have the plague it's fun

155
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,110
right analysis is performed on an image

156
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,279
you know if it helps think about is a DD
we use other formats to

157
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,250
with varying degrees above up crap turn
on for proprietary interest so they can

158
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:15,670
sell things to you but

159
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,469
basically a bit stream copy is its
standard

160
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,829
a DD will work to keep their fire

161
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:26,559
a.m. it's important to note that
evidence exists on the media

162
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,118
the take in on talking about civil
recovery I'm not explaining law enforcer

163
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,889
recovery because I don't do that

164
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:35,230
its but in civil recovery case adjusted

165
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,129
went into an office after 6 p.m.
everybody was gone

166
00:09:39,129 --> 00:09:42,230
Human Resources thought somebody was up
to something bad and I'm not talking

167
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,100
about foreigners in this stupid like
that cuz that's really the shallow end

168
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,420
of the pool

169
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,240
um we went in image the machine and then
went looking for

170
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,839
yeah sure enough there were intrusion
tools on it

171
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,040
there were you know Kapisa other
people's files should have had access to

172
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,649
you

173
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:02,860
and you know we were able to give the
client what they wanted to know

174
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,619
and then they decided where to go from
there

175
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:11,180
the report that I did which is getting
back to this third bullet point here

176
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,990
report that I did served as a map to
where that information could be found

177
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,209
in the evidence my report is never
evidence it's

178
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:22,379
simply an index to it and you know if
you work in a case where images are

179
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:25,869
important you can make copies of the
images but you still have to go back in

180
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:28,519
you know there have been times when
people said I wanna know the hex offset

181
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,920
where that begins in your league okay

182
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,498
fine what's more billable hours I'm good
with that

183
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:39,220
think you defense expert other times I
want to know if you actually is to toss

184
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,930
disc to boot the computer and

185
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,759
like not many years but

186
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:50,470
you think it's important we could do it

187
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:50,750
I

188
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,519
and finally the examiner in the quality
in the trust

189
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,819
in the court system that examiner brings
is key to getting that

190
00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:01,899
index accepted and 0 ice

191
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,550
just started the demo I wanna show you
this is one of the tools that we is

192
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:12,550
I hope night and put it there those
clever

193
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,309
keeper Tim I cannot see my directory
structure on to point out that I'm not a

194
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:21,610
security expert

195
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,410
and you could easily obtain access to
this machine

196
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,559
is written by from the mine 0

197
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:32,839
so you have

198
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,980
the source drive the UN access you
decide

199
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,679
you want the person to be guilty select

200
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:46,679
corn ha cleaned up clemency for ID theft

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,069
00 look at work too

202
00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:58,889
now we're talking about automated tool
that anybody could use in this

203
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:02,929
you're sitting in his presentation is
guys you know just doing acquittal VB

204
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:06,689
their face Aaron you know it's are
disturbing about into the conference

205
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:07,730
everybody had it

206
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:14,730
of yes a weenie area

207
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,699
right one of the tools that we use and
you may hear about this was a hardware

208
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:19,170
tool

209
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,439
you know going back to that we're
friends it has been for the last few

210
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,189
years is the static model

211
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:28,540
week dole we get the scooter is out we
remove the drive from the system in our

212
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,919
tell you a story later five-time about
why we don't necessarily do anymore

213
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,699
but here's a model you take the hard
drive out to plug it into a hardware

214
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:36,470
write blocker

215
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,959
I spent way too much money in these damn
things by I've got one for sale I've got

216
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,970
one for scares you have got one for it.
I've got one for USB

217
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:47,540
and bring it cuz my suitcase was
followed black t-shirts I could wear

218
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,009
around your

219
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:51,519
this allows you to

220
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,419
take that it stream copy up the evidence
and

221
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:59,309
guarantee that you do not write back to
that evidence because tainting evidence

222
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:02,779
is just bad it's not something you want
to do

223
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:06,809
sometimes it happens when it does it
doesn't mean you have to run in circles

224
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:07,579
and scream

225
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:11,759
you know what happened you know why it
happened in your honest about it

226
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,259
in that is the key if you lie on the
stand if you stretch evidence

227
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:19,749
somebody smarter than you was gonna
pointed out and then

228
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:25,059
you got a legal be a college professor
is every trust you anymore you do that

229
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:32,059
this

230
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,889
this is an excellent question so what is
the security guarantees you cannot

231
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:36,809
modify

232
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:40,959
the date on the tiny device these things
are tested and validated

233
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,730
if you don't testing yourself you're
very poor forensic practitioner or

234
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,709
you're really busy making enough money
to

235
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,360
do that but nest the Nationals to the
standards

236
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,389
also does that and they have reports
available there

237
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,179
there on the web just go to Department
now what are the under

238
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:01,449
commerce because our standards okay

239
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:05,929
in there also reports available to the
Nationals justice and I J which is the

240
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,959
the oversight branch for research within

241
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,339
Department justice they have copies of
all that where they've got a contest to

242
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:12,619
these

243
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:16,499
you can also go to any other friends
attackers you know people who

244
00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:19,899
were Def Con back you know when it was
cool

245
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:25,319
an hour out in forensics because frankly
they

246
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:28,809
just wanna get paid into something
useful they go on to this individual

247
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:30,118
testing I've done it

248
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:35,089
frankly what i do is i hook mine up to a
target drive well i md5 it I know what's

249
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:37,169
on it i hook it up

250
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:41,019
I images I see if it's changed in

251
00:14:41,019 --> 00:14:43,539
I can guarantee that when I boot with
Windows system on this thing is

252
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:45,419
connected to USB cable to my system

253
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:49,029
nothing has changed I do that under much
different conditions events I so

254
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,669
satisfied or get a job and I don't get
paid to do something is

255
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:58,640
otherwise I just publish it get you know
closer to ten year

256
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,370
night the basic steps amid I never go
fast enough

257
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,690
I'm trying a little faster as I do want
it in your questions I'm

258
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,420
the basic steps the things just taken
the time here really not taking calls

259
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,420
I'm the basis if investors acquiring the
data authenticating the data

260
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,200
interpreting and bear with me these
terms are loose

261
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,180
I interpreting the data and that's so
important because if you don't know what

262
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,150
that file format means and you can't
really you're not doing a whole lotta

263
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,560
good

264
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,620
you can search for strings and stuff
like that but generally speaking

265
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,090
you want to be able to interpret that
data so file viewers are very important

266
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,690
like a tool that can get those all put
together for you see you don't have to

267
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,120
use thirty or forty different programs
to do an analysis

268
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,230
is that takes time you want to be able
to report the results

269
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,060
because that's why you're there it's fun
to do friends ex it's more fun to get

270
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,500
paid

271
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,600
mile yeah

272
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,220
and if your package is invalidated

273
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,310
and they don't provide training and
support the training and support I me

274
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,070
frankly I still go to the vendor
training

275
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,210
I host them at the University and that's
the only way I can afford to use them

276
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,230
it's a really expensive and

277
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,320
I so go and listen in and it's very rare
that I don't pick something up usually

278
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,440
cuz it's a colleague is teaching it and

279
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,650
you know they just on a tidbit like 11
so useful six months ago

280
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,170
but this

281
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,120
is the imaging program for one see i
sanitize it because I don't wanna

282
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,680
endorse any particular vendor which
brings me to the point

283
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,840
if you are going to select Tools select
a broad range of tools

284
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,090
I use three different packages on a
regular basis and what we found out is

285
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,230
in some cases

286
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,970
summer the mister that's really bad but
they're working on

287
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,250
I and that means we gotta go back and
look we do

288
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,160
that's where the difference between some
guy shows up 12 bucks for the training

289
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,449
by software for something more puts out
a shingle

290
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:59,420
you know in front of his squad desk at
Best Buy and

291
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:04,430
the difference being that and someone
has gone through this down

292
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:09,850
see recognises but we can read it thank
you

293
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:14,939
those you don't know what that means

294
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:18,760
as if you do great thus the doll that
you have to use

295
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,349
his own a demonstration later this is
the image into again but do you

296
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,810
recognize what that's an image of

297
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,980
some real status and presentations lot
more fun for them

298
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,240
everybody answer maybe they could see it
were offset :0

299
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,010
there's your first 10 yeah

300
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,790
okay no bootable partition to see the
message there its

301
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,990
this is the analysis talkers that
demonstration was a fun

302
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,370
in the beauty of these things the tools

303
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,880
is not that they do the thinking for you
there is

304
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,420
a gentleman in Austin who I admire
greatly

305
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,810
who has a friend's ex package built in
Linux someone once you're out the name

306
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,060
you can but again I'm not going on

307
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:10,370
dorsey particular product this part and

308
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,660
I love that thing and I'm not even
really a Linux user

309
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,860
as me guess because he's a PowerPoint
now but it is nice

310
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,810
I also use this particular product which
is not what I was missing

311
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,990
because it's convenient as a lot of the
things I need to do in a convenient way

312
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,170
and here's the deal if the package does
the job it does all those functions I

313
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:29,880
just listed

314
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,410
it's good if it takes the tedious
repetitive work of love you

315
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:37,540
it's good if it replaces your own mind

316
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,760
in the equation it's bad undertrained

317
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,800
people are people in secure about their
knowledge like me more secure about

318
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,159
don't do a good job because the tool

319
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,920
presents information for you organize
for you it lets you run searches across

320
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,580
multiple different images

321
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,629
but what it does not do is

322
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,170
that forensic plane are still open is
not what it doesn't do is develop the

323
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,530
case where you've really got to know
what it is you're looking for

324
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,120
and that's where the training experience
come in that's where your knowledge that

325
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,310
you already have come in

326
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,070
in if you haven't thought about it
before think about the things you would

327
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,730
look for

328
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,210
right if you're looking to prove that
someone has child pornography what you

329
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,650
gonna do

330
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:23,080
look at pictures right

331
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,820
immediately call on first down this
route that stuff it's it's just so toxic

332
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,379
but if you're looking for network
intrusion

333
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,180
what are you looking for you go for the
locks you look for

334
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,190
evidence tools on the machine at the
first think is doing a special

335
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,830
get access to it and I'm not even
getting into why and how you have access

336
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,129
to

337
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,660
is scope has two come down somewhere

338
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,270
this does nice things

339
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,750
a cursor this line is labeled

340
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:57,680
KFF alert files that's known file filter
and what it does which is so nice is it

341
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
takes the hassle for known file

342
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,660
it says this file it has it is all
that's just part

343
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,930
Microsoft operating system and its
unchanged ignores

344
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,770
in its own eyes keys you know you've got
forty fifty

345
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,470
hundred thousand files on the system and
you really gonna be jacked around with

346
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:13,750
that

347
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:16,980
takes a look at duplicates it lets you
filter them out conveniently but it

348
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,020
doesn't force you to

349
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,330
and that's where the key things things
that make decisions for you bad

350
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:25,710
things at let you make decisions good be
careful love the guy by the keyboard at

351
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,340
that point because he may not understand

352
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,639
what decisions he's taking the default
on what that means

353
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,840
um bad extension this is one of the
things I really like about this there's

354
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,429
another package out there

355
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,620
the company that I have a good
relationship with respect a lot but

356
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,680
it looks at the file extension to
determine what type of file is

357
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,370
and that's just a non-starter I can
rename a text file dot lock

358
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,560
you know you may be able to put that in
there and say out log files usually text

359
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,649
but changing three-letter extension
Innova files really easy

360
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,320
I what this one does is takes a look at
the header

361
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,480
it goes into the very beginning in the
file and it matches it to that had her

362
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,280
signature

363
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,090
you learn more about that later have
another presentation can bring up like

364
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,090
that but

365
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,149
was get through this one um

366
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,040
it lets you sort the types files wanna
look at

367
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,050
in this handy because if you're not
looking for graphics you don't have to

368
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,350
mess with graphics

369
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,870
you looking at email you wanted dole who
released the company's trade secrets

370
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,720
right is it gonna be a graphic well you
know there might be indications there

371
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,530
but

372
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,420
that's just the players really deep
pockets at once you look at graphics for

373
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,580
that

374
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,540
I'm the nice in the slides a random
forgive me

375
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,850
I'm gonna connect this with the talking
then it this case

376
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,730
there are penalties for people in the
civil world in again remember I'm

377
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,950
talking about the civil world not
criminal investigations

378
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,650
if you delete data you can be subject to
civil penalties

379
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,400
the type of case I'm typically working
is an intellectual property case

380
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,400
some admin left the company

381
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,730
took the passwords with them the new
admin is barely

382
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,810
understanding how the system has been
screwed up I mean set up over the last

383
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,740
five six years

384
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,380
doesn't want to change the passwords on
key accounts committee you've seen it

385
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,520
if you haven't done it you've seen
people did

386
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,100
and now the old admin is accessing or
should I say

387
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,510
the BlackBerry service is accessing the
CEO's

388
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,080
emailing for those who don't know that
service should not be

389
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,240
inbreeding anybody's email and it
shouldn't be explained people's file

390
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,160
directors and stuff like that

391
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,850
what you do in that case is you have a
client you go in you grab their

392
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,050
information that you need

393
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,500
take a look at their locks inspectors up
to tape take home with you

394
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,000
you look eMachines you believe were
involved image those

395
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,850
and analyzing later and then develop the
case

396
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,480
they bring a lawsuit not talking about a
criminal case they bring a civil suit

397
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,990
against the rival that simply they're
all that men

398
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,160
right take it to court with a subpoena

399
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,870
going get their stuff when you take a
look at it no

400
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,130
anybody in law enforcers just aghast at
this and you've maybe notice the whole

401
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:06,790
in this

402
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:11,149
till that any particular training what
if they delete the evidence

403
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:16,200
well you know erasing programs leave
tracks I've got a couple

404
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,280
instances of that here in the demo file
by item

405
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,430
tell generally where the racers Ben I've
got a hex profile

406
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,450
it takes a makes histogram the fights
index

407
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,290
and it's really easy to tell it's been
over it with random characters because

408
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:31,540
it's even more regular than encryption
or

409
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,889
compressed it there's just the look

410
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,990
that says I've been overwritten with
random characters in

411
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,820
it's very compelling to a jury to see a
histogram

412
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,100
%uh I've got a lot of sites on the
different certifications because I

413
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:46,860
wasn't sure

414
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,050
if any if you'd be interested in moving
into this area

415
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:53,450
wanna questions I tend to get a lot is
what do I need to do

416
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,650
to get that validation my experience

417
00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,590
right now I'll everybody I recommend the
starting point is a CISSP

418
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,520
I always forget those letters stand for
so I put on the power point for me

419
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,379
as much as you it's important understand
all certifications

420
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,760
that any nights anybody

421
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,840
Microsoft Certified engineer

422
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,899
yeah okay well you know certifications
are worth %uh

423
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:22,830
the certifying at the sorry

424
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:26,750
a the certifying authority has to have
trust

425
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:30,580
right this is one of the organizations
is maintained its trust

426
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,820
I'm now this is a fun one the csce

427
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,629
you've got to be in law enforcement to
take the training I know the guy has a

428
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,100
president of that organization I'm still
working on him to let me get in there

429
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,750
i'd just easy's maintaining that trust
for his organization you let me in

430
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,380
I can't take this training it the
certification there are number

431
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,030
certifications like that which really
helps former law enforcement officers

432
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:57,050
who have acquired this knowledge and
learned at heart

433
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,320
mean they work for it to come in and
move more easily into the forensics

434
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,500
field but there are other options

435
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,820
I'm mmm this certification is a good
example is one that's losing its

436
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,720
currency it may be coming back

437
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,810
several years ago it was a good one now
the organization

438
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,580
that gave it it's doubtful if they exist
anymore to function away

439
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,080
but you know a lot of the old guard have
this credential and turned it back in

440
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,100
the day and

441
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,980
they still carry it we have other things
like from let's see

442
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,470
the federal law enforcement training
center the provide this this is kinda

443
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,010
the entry-level

444
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:37,550
he worked as I get to go to george on
vacation for a couple weeks

445
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,409
to you cover my shifts for cops and
federal agents and all that stuff

446
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,410
again this is a law enforcement
certification but you can get

447
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,820
the same training somewhere else

448
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,730
unfortunately there's a lot of money to
be made in forensics

449
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,919
and the people give the certs know that
and you pay for

450
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,360
so someone mentioned a product

451
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,610
that used to be called expert witness

452
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,669
you know the story and that is look it
up its great soap opera story

453
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,760
that there was a product that is because
expert witness that is now being sold

454
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,629
under different brand in its been

455
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,590
its bears little resemblance to its
ancient lineage but

456
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:20,550
it's a very popular package it cost heck
of a lot of money

457
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,270
I can't afford so I work with companies
like use it

458
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,340
you know I've friends started their
companies that use their copy one

459
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,980
apartment cases for them

460
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,400
the No that were out there making money
with the stuff and they they don't sell

461
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,370
it cheap

462
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,179
same thing with certifications they know
that you're gonna be out there making a

463
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:37,890
lot of money

464
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,720
so breaking into this if you don't have
a lot of money is hard which is why for

465
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,280
years I've done my friend sex with
Windex

466
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,510
or you know some other hex editor
because I just couldn't

467
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,990
get that what they were paying a grad
student or you know then junior

468
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,520
professor

469
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,350
but if you can get into it if you can
get to work with the company that will

470
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,580
let you start going to those trains and
you want to do it

471
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,889
do it and realize they're giving an
incredibly valuable skill

472
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:06,600
maybe you know forgive them for the poor
pay they're doing at the moment

473
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,429
because they are really setting you up
for the future

474
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:13,560
more stuff more stuff um

475
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,990
their tool certifications in again the
certification doesn't make you better.

476
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,050
the training behind it often does

477
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,330
but when you get into court there some
assumptions it can be made if you've

478
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,320
been certified

479
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,480
it's not a guarantee lawyers can argue
about anything

480
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,810
putting the color the sky but you know

481
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:34,030
a clever lawyer will not argue the
validity of these well-known

482
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,270
industry standards certifications that's
why they're handy to have the

483
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,770
keep you from having to answer a few
awkward questions right

484
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:43,870
you know you know your friends know you
know it does the court now you know it

485
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,169
well these letters find your name

486
00:27:48,169 --> 00:27:51,270
and then there's other stuff right

487
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,600
there's some debate other over whether
these are valid or not you know for the

488
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,669
forensics field

489
00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:00,790
frankly why not have them the entry cost
denny's is fairly low

490
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:04,360
for a plus what does that mean you can
get hired at Best Buy

491
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,960
unit stock their pairs

492
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,320
by it also proves the you know you've
had some sort of validated training on

493
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,149
the hardware

494
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:15,050
so you can remove the hard drive from a
computer as we all know how difficult

495
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:20,139
that can be

496
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,520
I just have one side comment why did
pedophiles always smoke a lot

497
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,590
in not clean the inside your computer
ever

498
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:37,590
well you know I'm just sayin I I work
gloves

499
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:39,980
okay

500
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,090
this one read it thank you

501
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,410
as I don't either um dis

502
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,650
this deals with this is from the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act

503
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,460
has been a lot of

504
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,440
a floppy indeed about here um one of the
things you've got to be careful with

505
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,960
is intercepting communications in route
just because the federal crime is

506
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,270
generally in the civil side as I've
heard a couple presentations or bring up

507
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,710
you're safe if your client owns the data

508
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:12,250
its there's right

509
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,780
generally speaking you're covered now
I'm not a lawyer I'm not giving legal

510
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,330
advice

511
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:20,139
I will not appear in court and say yes I
said that hope 60 you should let this

512
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,880
guy ago he didn't really commit a felony

513
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,530
but the fact of the matter is there
certain practices in the field

514
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,570
if you get experienced if you get with
people know what they're doing you learn

515
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,230
from them

516
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,880
you're a safe as any member the herd if
suddenly the courts decide law

517
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,880
really works a different way there's
there's a lot any of us can do yes

518
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:45,400
that is the into the slideshow now comes
the interactive portion

519
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:50,250
got roughly 15 minutes a presentation
template I can either take questions

520
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:53,350
or I can discuss a little bit the
technical details of what we do

521
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:59,510
or I can demonstrate house bars scroll
across things while you wait just

522
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,990
that's the key to forensics what a tube
of

523
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,070
text figures

524
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,600
okay this is from another presentation I
just like because

525
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,809
somebody who's really technical those
can tell you're such a dork

526
00:30:17,809 --> 00:30:21,139
looking at data

527
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:24,970
this is the fun stuff this is hacking
forensics if you will

528
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:29,260
this is not using the standard tools is
not doing things a certified way this is

529
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,620
what does a little fragment the pagefile
me nor

530
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,880
what is that in the slack but we don't
get that anymore this

531
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,190
and at the old stuff in one explain the
distance I want to know this day doubt

532
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,120
it to be discovered

533
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,220
so no

534
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,700
Julia let's go back I

535
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,929
I've hidden I've obscene obfuscated a
file here

536
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,880
you know what type it is no

537
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,860
its eat don't don't overthink this one
cuz this is the shallow and we'll get

538
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,480
deeper

539
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,890
do you think it's a Jay pag okay

540
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,419
the reason for that is there's another
one with the same name without the

541
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:08,919
extension it's the same size and

542
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,220
you can see what they have the same day
it's good wasn't it

543
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:17,490
I mean seriously sometimes the answers
are easy in a few get too busy looking

544
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,720
for hard answers

545
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,750
you miss the easy ones if you've spent
no time looking for the deleted email

546
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,460
you don't actually check the Inbox

547
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,440
you can miss it not that that's happened
to me

548
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,120
often

549
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,490
I on any system the have access to it
let's assume you want to do

550
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,680
active running forensics or you know you
want someone

551
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,760
like the police just all shouting like
oh no you can't get on the active system

552
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,490
in with your civil we can do anything we
want in

553
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:49,880
civil judges don't know either so you
can always get in and take a look at the

554
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,590
hex editor

555
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,810
that there's always one of the I know
had some things going to be there

556
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:56,870
so what do you think

557
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:02,170
what kind of file do you think this is
text by yes

558
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,600
are I was a teacher to give out his this
would be more interesting for you then

559
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,310
but and chief I

560
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:12,260
what kind of file do you think this is
yea

561
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:16,810
alright with you are about to get the
Cal certification for forensics just

562
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,990
a ask for getting great newbie he has a
certificate no I'm kidding

563
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,650
right here's the cold a big hole in the
side

564
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:31,100
yes um know you I hope everybody
understands hex if you don't

565
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,930
I'm I'll be happy to explain it every
also hate you

566
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,740
this is what I thought was fun

567
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:43,520
taking his bike histograms and what it
does is it just counts the number I love

568
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,920
empty bites all zeros full bites

569
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,570
all one's and everything in between in a
week yes

570
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:56,550
how many columns are in this histogram
no 256 that's right because beastly

571
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,830
start counting this one is number two
fifty-five go back

572
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:05,380
yes exactly and

573
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:10,860
each different file type has a look to
it in I wish I could be more definite no

574
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,260
I wish I could say we could eventually
someday pattern match it with algorithms

575
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,360
and maybe some love you could but I
can't so what I do is sit there and look

576
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:17,880
at them

577
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,900
and bill by the hour

578
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,590
right yes we were right it is a picture
it's

579
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,130
its action for tested in this to be
given in New York City but nice

580
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:36,059
its

581
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,879
it was disturbing to me I I did this
right after the event and I was

582
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,770
you know or the make it hard now this is
a different kind if I'll

583
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,450
obviously you've got the name ovett up
there in the the title bar

584
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,840
but you see that there's a very
different look to it this is a bitmap

585
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,410
file

586
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,429
it isn't 8-bit it now file CC there are
a lot of bites that are

587
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:59,440
used not just colors are underused but
there are some

588
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,960
bites simply don't get used in 8-bit it
now image

589
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,690
um sure yet somehow

590
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,889
statistically and you've gotta leave the
deterministic computer science mindset

591
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,179
here for a minute and go into the social
science which is where I stand by me

592
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,359
got my PhD in think probabilistically

593
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,290
a small sample love a relatively
homogeneous

594
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,929
dataset knows doesn't work with with the
ex cuba file so well kisses are

595
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:28,550
homogeneous

596
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,100
but the more day to you have the more
homogeneous it's likely to be a crossed

597
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:32,719
at all

598
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:37,780
in any given sample love that should
relatively well represent

599
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,090
the whole it doesn't work all the time
because bites are randomly distributed

600
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,320
programs

601
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,399
but the ideas there

602
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,339
so if you have enough data in your
sample you can make inferences from a

603
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,080
small fragment

604
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:54,759
so you don't have the header so you
don't have the extension deleted file

605
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,460
but you do have this pilot bites is
otherwise useless

606
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:02,330
you can identify where that might have
come from which would make it easier to

607
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:02,980
match it

608
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,760
to by patterns in another file now again
if it's one of those known files it

609
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,800
happens all the time

610
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,750
it's not so useful to you but if it's a
unique file like an image

611
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:16,920
you can take a small fragment of an
image and take those by

612
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,440
patterns search for them with and other
images and maybe find it and then it's

613
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,650
really just a matter how well can you
make the case

614
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,900
it's not a done deal but if you get
enough bites in enough places

615
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,510
right you know how many bytes it take to
give the statistical certainty its

616
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,400
you know whatever you're willing to
stake your reputation on in court and

617
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,800
end up looking like an idiot if Iran

618
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,580
thats the forensic scientific argument
processing core

619
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,970
there's the image now for those you have
an exodus before this is compressed data

620
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,540
which is fun compressed data in Creek
today to look very similar in pure

621
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,020
random data look very similar

622
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,380
but their differences it there are
certain

623
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,600
peaks for lack of a better term to this
compressed

624
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,040
right the original file zipped it's a

625
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,650
it's a sniffer programs I think it's
Italian one remember I is a long time

626
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,160
and this is inexcusable found no

627
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,160
interesting interesting thing about
excusable files as many of you know

628
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:17,930
better than I do

629
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,220
they have a lot of empty bites or all
zeros

630
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:25,440
it's just the nature of them so if you
get one of these files with an extremely

631
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,970
high amount of white space

632
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:30,830
there's a good chance it to execute a
law

633
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:34,310
it's not a done deal but it's one of the
things we don't have fun

634
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:39,060
J pics

635
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:42,090
have a very spiky structure you know
checks have an underlying

636
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,540
compression pattern to them it's hard to
compress such a pic but if you look at

637
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,990
this point structure you can see that
there's a lot of room for homogenization

638
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:56,730
it's not like a zip file the compression
is in his tight has a square up to the

639
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:57,650
fact you geoff has done

640
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,820
as for a while Turner and there's the

641
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,800
the basic image it was on text is fun
text is highly clustered and guess what

642
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,550
the printable characters

643
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,270
unico de and ask Ian

644
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,350
in CI and ours as I

645
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:20,799
thanks in C a lot of people

646
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,260
our lifetimes i questions on the test as
I give them a lot of white space

647
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,660
and a buncha letters and they think it
means spaces

648
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:32,759
and try to commit sins the space is not
represented by

649
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,359
a binary string zeros I think white
space you know i mean it's just an

650
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:39,799
important distinction in amateur contest

651
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,800
unico text encrypt it this is pgp

652
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:55,240
just like as I was gonna send it out by
email

653
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,089
there is the original file it understand
the scale changes

654
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:02,290
sort of its the high amount of white
space

655
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:05,520
in the original file because it was
Unicode really throws of those

656
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,560
histograms I haven't found a good
reliable way to get rid of that

657
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,859
enforce the other ones in high relief

658
00:38:12,859 --> 00:38:16,710
what's it's just a tool that I use I
mean I could generate

659
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,190
on histograms I guess but

660
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,359
I just had too lazy so far

661
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,299
but you're right that there is a way to
do it was too lazy to figure it out

662
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,010
and the last way with which I consider
is the most reliable method if you have

663
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,180
access to it is to take a look at the
headers

664
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:41,490
time all five minutes left have an
extended

665
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:44,530
said questions because I want this to be
useful Tijuana

666
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,080
answer the questions that you have and
remember I'm not going to make a point

667
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,029
here is trying to

668
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,710
to be helpful

669
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,880
still care other

670
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,910
this like okay is on up I guess my
question would be

671
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,910
hardest passwords I don't know if you're
familiar with them I would imagine you

672
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,210
probably are

673
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,390
yeah arm is happening I've had to deal
with with

674
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,450
trying to recover data people forget
them

675
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,050
I talking about 83 passwords the

676
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:20,210
their common on the IBM and Lenovo's
laptops

677
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,760
a high-touch is the company where I get
the standard from

678
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,859
I think they are PTA standards so

679
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:30,490
that they're two separate ways to do
that in fact if anybody here has a

680
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,500
chance to get

681
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:35,250
file forensics books by a book by Bryant
carrier

682
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,930
it is right now the best reference i've
seen it's not

683
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,350
missus it is the best reference i've
seen

684
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:47,390
I have not a bad thing to say about it
that being said

685
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,390
you know if I was if I'd written the
book there are other things that were

686
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,390
put in

687
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,049
that he was down from his perspective
and I respect that it's it's better than

688
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,369
anyone else's

689
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:59,630
he covers at utilities is what it boils
down to:

690
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:04,060
will everything I've seen on this and
have done a little better research

691
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,430
don't think been experiencing but the
password seem to be

692
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,569
locked on the drive where it's locked in
a mode

693
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:15,000
can't do anything other than give it the
password

694
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,280
or reset the password which still
requires giving it password

695
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,330
the first place and you can't

696
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,460
you could brute force it but there's no
other way to Li

697
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,119
get the password of the drive to
actually get to it I mean

698
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,720
is there anything out there other than
Lee the special

699
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,920
gonna have a forensics license utilities
were

700
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,820
I guess trying utility it's more
hardware

701
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,950
yen on it it comes right from
manufactures in their real snotty about

702
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:44,410
giving out except a law enforcement

703
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,490
this is one of those areas where overlap

704
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:50,869
in my experience has been bad to give
you an answer

705
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:54,100
because the last time I thought about
that question in a real serious way it

706
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,460
was within the law enforcement contacts

707
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,260
and I gave that answer to some ass
licking each scored talk to manufacture

708
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,940
talked about how to get past it

709
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:05,609
I haven't come into that in the civil
side

710
00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:08,950
it is possible to do I know it's out
there and

711
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,710
we is one of those expensive utilities
to get around all someone can come up

712
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,180
with an

713
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,759
open source hardware solution please do
posted

714
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,109
somewhere yeah our mail it to me and
I'll

715
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:24,220
I'll put it up for you I mean I don't
believe in keeping the stuffs

716
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,020
it's free it's out there inches at many
sites there on my website for my classes

717
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,859
the only real inconveniences I have to
change the names every semester because

718
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,089
the university's web server makes me

719
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:38,770
well as we change the name of the
semester so I can have an absolute path

720
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:42,670
sir

721
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,940
us i was just wondering if I'd never
recommended reading list

722
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,050
some places star just mention Apple and
the others

723
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:55,890
yes um this transit up with the book
have co author is not on it

724
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,540
in KC I can't recall the name of the
book

725
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,790
gonna say it's digital evidence if you
go in the Amazon

726
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:08,270
in look for storage forensics or
computer forensics

727
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,859
you should be able to find that book
I've got I've got eventually signed it

728
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:12,859
this semester

729
00:42:12,859 --> 00:42:18,089
another book is I was his call computer
forensics by Warren Chris

730
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:22,290
KR USC is at the time it came out

731
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,060
the best resource I'd ever seen it
surplus

732
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:29,470
several others in this particular arena
understands what I'm talking about or

733
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,030
not

734
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:33,450
the CS style forensics carriers bogus

735
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:37,180
but these other ones are you know
different mice

736
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:40,700
my side house index yeah um

737
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,300
there've been a lot of articles and 2600
mentions I'm

738
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,520
the radio program about how to protect
your data and what you might want to do

739
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,240
if you're going to be throwing on a hard
drive

740
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,090
and things like that I'm wondering what
your recommendation is for

741
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:58,120
out there hiding my point for people
like you

742
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,470
I I'll out the answer it philosophically

743
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:06,350
because I can't give you a definitive
answer encryption there's really no good

744
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:07,460
rule hi bit

745
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,330
encryption you know encryption can be
broken but then there's realistic

746
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,360
breaking encryption their tool kits out
there you know it was

747
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,190
we know about the rainbow tables and go
through the Microsoft documents about

748
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,010
three minutes

749
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,450
me literally three minutes and your
Excel spreadsheet is mine

750
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:27,010
otherwise we use the same attacks

751
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,080
anyone else does removable media

752
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,790
is often a problem for me so I'm not
actually suggesting it but you think

753
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:36,600
about where

754
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,080
you ideally the first thing is not to
have incriminating stuff

755
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,360
call me crazy

756
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,350
especially for trying to build up that
solid reputation that gives you the high

757
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:48,540
pay job that I've only recently been
smart if

758
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,790
figure I've you know I could get is have
been really portal this year

759
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:55,110
I'm how else would you hide it

760
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:59,590
outside on obfuscated a to I'll tell you
a brief story

761
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:02,850
like when police get this training
backend

762
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:06,380
the mid 90's there was always a story
about hackers booby trapped in their

763
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,020
computers

764
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,990
well that means you like if you don't
get the right to me and it starts

765
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:15,750
erasing things right you know this the
Jinal Pandya stuff generally believe in

766
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,290
any way

767
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,490
in they thought it literally meant that
something was gonna jump outta there and

768
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:19,900
get 'em

769
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,080
like a shotgun shell wired to some

770
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:27,319
I mean I don't even know what exactly is
in the computer that would jump at get

771
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,640
your butt they were like

772
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:31,890
X in your people who swore you do it
behind plywood

773
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,120
costs to sell stuff the shotgun shell
focus

774
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,859
but you know sophistications gonna I'm
not making fun of course was like

775
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:41,980
anybody else you know a newbie hackers
really not all that Swift either

776
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,490
it's just its new be its new be
everywhere newbie frenzy guy makes

777
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,210
mistakes

778
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:49,950
been spins on the evidence hard rock I

779
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,500
I mention you you're ten most is the
physical

780
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:56,950
mediums like the hard drives before

781
00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,780
like while someone's being arrested or
before the half-time do anything but his

782
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,230
physical damage to the

783
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,140
to the drive going to be we user data
recovery from a clean room

784
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,960
a a guy that I know very well runs it is
a huge warehouse for spare parts

785
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,430
regional controller boards for really
really obscure things like some

786
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,910
hit a one megabyte hard drive for
Commodore 64

787
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:24,910
as hey that not right but artist but I
wanted to actually bring that long use a

788
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,070
story back to it

789
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:32,040
people hide evidence use it a lot don't
do really

790
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,050
goofy obfuscation me think about it if
you knew that you were gonna miss type

791
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,150
your password once all your data will be
erased

792
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:41,170
you don't do that if you do damn

793
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:45,330
what's wrong with you you given a
restore your backup slot which means

794
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,450
your backup tapes nearby anyway so use

795
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,290
what's the point um for obfuscation to
see

796
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:55,670
is good passwords he's getting Christian
and then don't bother with the goofy

797
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,170
stuff

798
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,460
now I want to teach thanks

799
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,730
my questions about certification

800
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:08,410
I heard the I don't know what university
this year was the first class is

801
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,129
graduating

802
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,690
people with the Pano forensics degree if
you could talk about that and whether

803
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,630
that's relevant

804
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:18,130
will it be relevant I you know

805
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:21,790
a last year even I would have said
something stupid

806
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:25,910
along those lines my thought is the more
people do this the more programs are

807
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,950
started the better quality we're going
to develop

808
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,330
in a people don't do things my way
they're not wrong I know that now and

809
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:35,990
I'm very sorry sorry go somewhere else
from it no but

810
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:39,210
I mean the more programs are out to the
more people are looking into this the

811
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:39,700
better

812
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,690
I would love to see more CS loss I'd
collaboration

813
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:47,180
I work with all faculties and frankly I
think we do have some really

814
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:51,720
useful things when we do it um those
programs

815
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,960
are good I see the danger to them

816
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,030
is in if you're thinking about going and
getting a bachelor's or master's in

817
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:59,020
computer forensics

818
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,820
realize that ubiquitous encryption means
the field doesn't exist anymore

819
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:09,730
real quick until we come up with a whole
new whiz-bang solution to get around it

820
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:13,240
you know cuz people were scared with
long or

821
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:17,680
would we do if it's on it's Kyle we get
it while it's still running I mean

822
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,180
we were literally started come up with
new training paradigm is based on

823
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,730
oh my god we've got to get it while it's
on so

824
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:28,860
in there are new forensic models being
developed

825
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,910
by some other vendors I really can't
talk about him

826
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:35,490
but it has to do with a more dynamic
forensic approach especially this is a

827
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:36,210
civil side

828
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:39,280
I i dont you hi and development law
enforcement just teach

829
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,690
sir I wanted to know if you had

830
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:47,080
any specific knowledge of program

831
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,590
that can read master file table

832
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:54,540
NTFS file system that's because for a
long time

833
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,070
I actually have done this recovery for a
while

834
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:05,450
and I use these diskette for fat 32 min
fat16

835
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,100
they could read that stuff it could show
you but I've never found a program that

836
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:12,040
did the equivalent that on NTFS

837
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,550
i was just wondering if you know any
automating the process

838
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:19,580
I like being able to look at the master
file table and say

839
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,020
this is you know this cluster points to

840
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:26,040
this particular file and you know

841
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,570
obviously vice versa which had a good
answer for that

842
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,730
we take a different approach we take the
oldest intact in the research here

843
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:38,100
so where you know the automatic tools
are the ones just

844
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,330
rebuild NTFS and have well

845
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,630
in a contained environment without
starting up a software

846
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:51,630
but if you bring up an image and let's
go and do it

847
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,259
by the way while I'm doing this I just
wanna say hello to all the people who

848
00:49:03,259 --> 00:49:04,589
are watching this on the web

849
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:11,589
or the DVD in the future go ahead yell
at me we're looking for here

850
00:49:12,229 --> 00:49:15,239
image let's do this one

851
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:18,489
me

852
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:22,890
this utility that's free I'm

853
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:29,219
allows you to bring up the file system
now this one

854
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:33,059
is when they got wiped but if there was
a native file system on it it was a hard

855
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:33,539
drive

856
00:49:33,539 --> 00:49:36,680
you'll be able to go down it throws in a
couple extra files

857
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:40,629
in one of the problems with recovery and
that is people delete things things get

858
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,009
hidden

859
00:49:41,009 --> 00:49:44,329
in need to find a way to represent him
so this tool takes

860
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:47,999
the idea that it identifies what it's
recovered for you and

861
00:49:47,999 --> 00:49:51,209
you can distinguish it from what the
user was able to see last time they

862
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:51,809
logged in

863
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:57,979
but this this rebuild it it'll do with
NTFS I'll do it riser

864
00:49:57,979 --> 00:50:02,359
ext2 get a driver's which by the way my
favorite find

865
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:09,359
is a txt two drivers so I can use that
Linux acquisition kid and just

866
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:12,749
open the image is right up of the

867
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:16,630
USB hard drive on this machine or a real
machine

868
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,910
my laptop what was the name of that
program you just

869
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,390
is called FTK imager FTK

870
00:50:23,390 --> 00:50:26,390
them sorry

871
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:29,440
talking with humor question um

872
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,319
have you ever use inserted imagine
members to

873
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,690
rituals and which was stills live
imaging

874
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:40,529
a member the problem with that

875
00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:43,660
is you've got to have a softer install
the system and

876
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,969
is someone gonna cut me know otherwise I
am not aware of a solution

877
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:51,519
that allows you to do that well so it's
only on the civil side that we would do

878
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,759
that and yes it is possible

879
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:57,029
community hex editor a good have said
they will be able to open RAM

880
00:50:57,029 --> 00:51:00,249
and second part is a

881
00:51:00,249 --> 00:51:04,630
for those who me to pursue civil what do
you know the conditions for getting

882
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,859
involved with the military

883
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:10,430
flips the police I know absolutely
nothing about the military the NSA CIA

884
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:14,660
many other three letters of put together
make my advice

885
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:18,769
overall is have a clean record be honest
always be honest

886
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:23,180
because integrity is is what you're
selling in forensics if you give that

887
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:23,680
out

888
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,940
if you get a track record a special
in-court you're just really after the

889
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,410
game

890
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:33,118
just go sit on the bench go away is
nobody wanna play ball with you anymore

891
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:39,199
what issues do

892
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,420
assay raid 0 or 85 have

893
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,690
in effect of the forensic and/or
recovery process and how can you

894
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,039
make sure that it doesn't get written to

895
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:53,920
or somehow get the evidence get tainted
for its a pain in the ass

896
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,099
um it is

897
00:51:57,099 --> 00:52:00,869
here images upgraded discs if you don't
have the same controller

898
00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:05,849
are just soul probably not gonna work
really what we do know is that when X

899
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:06,509
disc

900
00:52:06,509 --> 00:52:09,729
to do dynamic acquisition of them and
that

901
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:12,959
disc is so nice because it mounts
everything read-only

902
00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:17,140
you don't need the right blockers throw
the disc in boot to that system

903
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:20,900
and then you just acquire away right
onto a little

904
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:24,559
external drives you in

905
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,479
see this is the thing you thinkin you
want answers on your terms and

906
