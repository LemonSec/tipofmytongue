1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:03,979
yeah okay to tonic

2
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:10,979
making reliable links using wifi good
afternoon

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,619
yes a list are some

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,200
making reliable wifi home bro stuff them

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,590
yeah so anyway who I am

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,890
you know virtually every one of us is
probably about the same on this you know

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,160
if its infrastructure you're interested
dollars

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,340
fun stuff I worked for a work to

9
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,560
in this is aka

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,570
up were too small wireless ISP

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,960
on we didn't really get too far before
funding ran out is

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,200
you know everybody knows on so they

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,350
they educated me on some other stuff and
you know I system and and installing the

14
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:55,050
citywide

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,560
never do we put in been ham radio for
thirteen years

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,130
and as I say there I went off the deep
end which is

17
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,180
kinda hard to qualify I but basically

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,290
you know you reach a certain point we
get interested and stuff

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,640
and you can't find people

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,299
to talk with an About and that's that's
how the difficult part there

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,470
but our you know this is is
consequential stuff okay

22
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,658
the some assumptions here I'm is kinda
difficult

23
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:29,600
are arm fault we we everybody know nosy

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,090
year you're here for our for this

25
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,310
alright you want to play reliable now

26
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,510
wifi links you know the wifi is a former
radio you know two layers or any other

27
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,090
kind

28
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,340
and you know a wifi card is obviously

29
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,510
Tom the a you know

30
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,280
former radio here PFM mine is pure
freaking magic

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,479
lot of folks you know just kinda feel
put up to

32
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,570
to radio's andrea magically stuff works

33
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,250
for them but I be who i five

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,920
just like your cell phone is a radio so

35
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,779
and in the other some signs are that you
know it in the antennae is in in a

36
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:13,150
obviously that you're not an RF engineer
intent on ruining my talk

37
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,719
dude but to that that

38
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,450
that was more for the hecklers than
anything else okay

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:26,090
alright your your powers bigger

40
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,769
the the gains basically broken down into
two basic group again in 10 again

41
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:36,349
in the very amplifier gain on and then
with %ah

42
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:40,839
with antennagate your dude you you're
taking the signal compression one

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,749
direction or another you putting in more
or less really wanted to stand up for

44
00:02:43,749 --> 00:02:44,129
you know

45
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:47,459
where r where you don't

46
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,609
on the condo this is that you can
typically

47
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,959
you know with the right antenna you can
communicating a relative

48
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:59,319
you know distances is very short but you
know fee for you

49
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:02,629
direct all that power in one specific
direction you can do stuff like you know

50
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:05,290
shoot across a 125 miles of desert

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,379
the UK

52
00:03:09,379 --> 00:03:13,540
so yeah basically

53
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,569
the the the theory behind it all was is
that you know you can invest in metal

54
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,829
not watch because it's it's typically
cheaper to do so

55
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:25,489
I with wifi there are power when it's
all over the place to the after to deal

56
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:25,829
with

57
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,510
and went when you go with a an amplifier
obviously generate more signal but the

58
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,279
condo that issue all to generate more
noise just because the device itself

59
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,900
you know he really had to believe noise
on the amplifiers typically are too

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,939
cheap to get a cheaper every day which
is a good thing for

61
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,409
you know for all of us especially those
guys who like to work drive to have one

62
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:45,099
amplifier

63
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,599
I but of course you've also got the FCC
requirements he have to deal with

64
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,540
irregardless on unless you just really
like making friends in

65
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,040
three-letter agencies %ah

66
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,290
cement okay arm

67
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,798
yet so YouTube you are you antennagate
you improve the signal directivity

68
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,930
specifically where it's at it's usually
fairly easy to install

69
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,989
antennas you know best bang for the buck
can get away with

70
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,798
you know buying an antenna thats you
know got more game than

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,149
do you typically cheaper than a an
amplifier and you can always build your

72
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:20,789
own to

73
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,120
that that may be a different point arm

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,010
home

75
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,370
but you get the point is diminishing
returns is is really the the limit

76
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,160
on antenna gain be and that's just where
you you you can reach a point where you

77
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,890
can add

78
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:41,620
do you know more elements to like a a
Yankee in 10 or something Indian can

79
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,920
increase its gain but it doesn't

80
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,920
increase at the same at the same break
you know you double the number of

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,140
elements be answered

82
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,150
one just you know you just don't gain
anything extra for that

83
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,200
now that you know typically gain is is
expressed in Indy be ir DVD

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,340
hams are probably more familiar with the
with

85
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,690
DVD which is decibels over a diaper for
reference because we all know wanna

86
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,450
die pollies on DVI is a

87
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,990
decibels over isotropic radiated an
isotropic

88
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,050
radiator is really difficult to

89
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,400
to express because an isotropic radiator

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,710
the only really good example we have one
is the Sun

91
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,049
it's basically just a point source in
one place

92
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,090
and the you know we have no way to
generate that

93
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:37,090
you know in anything other than you know
purely a model perspective

94
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,090
yes so amplifiers are expensive which
because as a given

95
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,590
and I the time the time that I got into
this

96
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,560
the amplifiers for two before gigahertz
with just 802 11b because she was around

97
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,240
I for nine hundred dollars and they
they've come down quite a bit

98
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,820
on but disfigure must-see represents the
the tower mounted

99
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,040
I amplifiers not to

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,540
what you find down at CompUSA you know
range extender something like that

101
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,190
some amplifiers will not do 802 11g on
this is because

102
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,560
the the modulation format the uses
different

103
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,630
and it will be basically forces
amplifier knee compression

104
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,880
and will destroy the signal

105
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,490
and again you know limited applications
and you usually use you're dealing with

106
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:28,550
the beard her DVM here

107
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,530
here so we've got a are a perp
essentially they've they were down about

108
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,590
the same thing

109
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:40,590
a the difference is that ones getting
in.

110
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,219
okay really important stuff here if the
SEC wants to talk with you about the ire

111
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,530
PA or earp

112
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,220
if you do with your system extremely
good idea to get a communications lawyer

113
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,980
one of those creatures that lived inside
the beltway arm

114
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,970
the good part about this is the SEC
really has adjusted their fine structure

115
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,270
too much since probably the 1950s

116
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,289
to ten thousand dollars isn't quite as
much money as it was

117
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,600
back then comp but still you know

118
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,720
they'd like to do this wonderful things
you'll find you ten thousand dollars a

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,510
day for every day the year in violation
and so on

120
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:21,590
and yes it's part 15 you can go to the
the internet you know anything published

121
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,090
by the

122
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,590
the Fed is is out there in some way
shape or form so

123
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,340
you can actually look at the SEC rules
but it's kind of a combination is

124
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,810
administrative stuff and and legally so

125
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,940
it's usually pretty easy to follow but
its all two very difficult to read

126
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,990
and as you know you know TT FW Google
freakin web

127
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,300
iraq on antenna gain was wonderful yet
so like I said

128
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,270
you know as in 10 again goes up are your
DirecTV

129
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,919
becomes well the antenna becomes more
directive so that you wind up with a

130
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,799
you know you're sick you're going to one
particular direction where this kid

131
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,419
for this little confusing for some folks
is that when you're dealing with the

132
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:03,359
vertical antenna

133
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,540
I think everybody kinda get used to
dealing with the perspectives that

134
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,430
you know you have a satellite dish or
something points one direction

135
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,680
and I you know you know the single kinda
goes that way but

136
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,830
with with an omni-directional antenna
you know the signal

137
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,830
forms a doughnut around and

138
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,930
is a problem with that is that the
higher gain the flatter than

139
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,310
down and gets it all begins a pancake

140
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,429
so here I have a really really crude
drawing

141
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,870
which kinda tim's to demonstrate some
%uh this is very generic

142
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,899
but to it like a sedative in more list
does the job here

143
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,099
up you know

144
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,749
you you've got me know a a fairly low
gain antenna there

145
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:50,639
and then a higher gain antenna instance
I did that one and

146
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,990
still further from the same perspective
here but

147
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,920
see be a it take an extent of the in
there but basically what you wind up

148
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,139
with this is that

149
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,870
your signal as as you increase in the
game you wind up pushing that load

150
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,339
further

151
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,540
out but at the cost that you now have
immense

152
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,399
vertical sensitivity I guess

153
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,559
will not not so is it a TV anyway if you
try to receive you tried it

154
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,850
to communicate outside of that envelope
on you're not gonna have very good luck

155
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,850
doing so because the the power may drop
off rapidly

156
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,499
well the a are

157
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:33,139
CNN in the big for the biggest problem
I've seen probably is that to you wind

158
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,970
up with a lot of folks who get into

159
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,509
no wifi you know get interested in this
stuff by the the hard way down to

160
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,069
compuserve whatever

161
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:43,319
the it's really difficult for some
people to separate the antenna gain in

162
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,628
the the power game

163
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:48,939
on and 10 that the first problems that
we saw was is that

164
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:52,629
on he had those fifty DVI antennas all
over the place

165
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:55,829
now when I'm getting the stuff we were
implementing it you know

166
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,360
using the commercial hardware 15 DB I
antenna was

167
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,309
probably what about I think eight feet
taller something

168
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:07,540
as standard in turn is only about that
tall actual radioman

169
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,879
so you wind up with this situation where
somebody goes into a given area and they

170
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,290
say well I'm gonna put this up I'll put
in the you know the highest power

171
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,540
stuff I get away with and you put a have
fun amplifier in with a 50 TV antenna

172
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,649
and the next thing you know you can't
communicate with any view user's because

173
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,490
you just sent that pancake a signal

174
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,709
right now to the horizon

175
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,980
and you know there's there's other
things that the factor into

176
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,379
particular you can always throw until it
down tilt into things

177
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:41,300
and turn it down till you see this a lot
with the cell phone networks you

178
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,540
do you drive around to see cell phone
tower usually always have their antennas

179
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,439
pull it down to some extent

180
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:49,660
and that's because they're actually
putting the beam where they needed

181
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,019
instead of just indiscriminately
dropping everywhere

182
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,290
the cell phone networks they a
micro-site arise everything as far as

183
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,730
they possibly can

184
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,759
are at the same time providing coverage
by

185
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,869
keeping oneself outside of another self
so that they

186
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,970
they can reuse is made channels as
possible

187
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,649
but it did the downed tools typically
based on their electrical who are

188
00:11:10,649 --> 00:11:13,809
mechanical mechanical is is pretty
obvious

189
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:18,089
on with the electrical is a is not so
obvious you can have two you know pick

190
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:22,050
up the intent and read the plane on it
and see what it says

191
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,709
and and also in WI I say down tilt here
but

192
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,220
you can also use up till two if you
happen to be trying to project

193
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,579
up a mountainside to reach your
customers

194
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,399
this is an example love mechanical down
till then I pulled off the internet to

195
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,009
this is a border blaster

196
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,660
high which is a fifty thousand what
station are located

197
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,149
on just on the other side of the
us-mexican border at San Diego

198
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,980
and now what you've got here is his
legacy 250 kilowatt station

199
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,230
and you probably can't see it but just
to the back of the

200
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,589
antenna elements themselves are
horizontal on

201
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:02,449
bars the that stick out there that
serves to reflect the signal

202
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:05,839
into the US instead of a new mexico on

203
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,059
dis this particular radio stations
actually been a long term violator

204
00:12:10,059 --> 00:12:13,389
a treaty that between the US and Mexico

205
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,069
but this this is a pretty good example
mechanical down to where you just

206
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:16,899
physically

207
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,509
you know lenient in over

208
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,949
and again electoral down till disease
ensure you're looking at it not for the

209
00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:24,860
perspective

210
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,529
tilting the antenna but more are just
the perspective

211
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:31,529
I love be doing electrically so that the
bean comes of

212
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:36,379
in you know it tilts down a hopper
however you need to go

213
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:40,249
and you here's obvious example you now
for SES the one where you saw that the

214
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:45,589
beam was just normal now here at
slightly down tilted

215
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:49,470
and yet another example these actual
antenna patterns like I was saying a

216
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,149
if you if you visualize the a antenna
being right in the middle

217
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,519
love that that drawing standing straight
up you can see that the

218
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,809
the one on the left there I obviously
have hit points down to some extent and

219
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:03,868
the one on the right doesn't

220
00:13:03,869 --> 00:13:07,850
now typically this is a an order option
on an 10 after purchasing one

221
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,540
a few billion antenna you usually causes
to happen by intentionally making it too

222
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,290
long or too short

223
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,719
and again you know when you're really
dealing with directional antennas %ah

224
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,110
you know you have far

225
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,709
that the signal kinda comes off against
this mushroom shape typically don't

226
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,029
worry about the back loves because thats

227
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:33,040
tax accidental radiation if you want to
call it that but

228
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,160
do you know if it's just off the the
reflector whatever

229
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,118
buddy to see wind up with the this kind
of mushroom shape you know

230
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:44,179
the signal the point outward in you know
downrange where

231
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:47,189
where you want to communicate

232
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:50,819
okay

233
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:54,439
are losses to the way she continuation
is

234
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:58,118
everywhere every piece of coaxial
connector you name it

235
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:02,489
it attenuates in some way and it's also
called assertion loss which is typically

236
00:14:02,489 --> 00:14:04,329
we doing very very low

237
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:08,259
amounts Asia mitch is something like
that even an amplifier has some

238
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:09,519
insertion loss in it

239
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,929
but because it generates so much more
power are

240
00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:16,899
so much for signal it you typically
don't worry about the parliament

241
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:20,739
but the you've also got path loss here
which is specifically the Los

242
00:14:20,739 --> 00:14:23,829
I in signal that happens between

243
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:28,050
are 20 and in the other now

244
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,119
see and of course there is software 22

245
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:34,749
calculate this if you wanna lay off the
map in everything you can you know put

246
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,629
two points in the software and you know

247
00:14:36,629 --> 00:14:41,439
give it to given some form of digital
terrain model and it will plot

248
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:45,209
the a pretty picture for you and show
you exactly you know

249
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:48,670
whether that Michael work or not and
it's called path loss interestingly

250
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,429
enough there's also another program out
there think I heard about the other

251
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:52,679
night which is a

252
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,939
like many path or something like that
microbe at

253
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:59,589
thank you I'm sorry

254
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,839
yes why pay for software because you can
just do this with algebra

255
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,249
some that wonderful fun stuff that comes
with you know picking up an old text

256
00:15:08,249 --> 00:15:09,279
book somewhere

257
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,529
and here's a really good formula for
doing that which is

258
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:18,230
obviously a magic number and a bunch of
stuff logarithms

259
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:22,629
UK okay

260
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,670
yes %uh here here's just something I
threw together which is

261
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,610
you know we do with path loss your you
can feel the loss between those two

262
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,249
points

263
00:15:30,249 --> 00:15:34,350
and depending on how far you're going
depends on how much razor is it is

264
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,949
logarithmic because the power loss

265
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:42,069
but you still wind up with you know you
Chris the lake by certain amount and you

266
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:45,389
may find out that you don't have nearly
as much losses you do

267
00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,889
by you can't really overcome the power
loss

268
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:52,100
if I if you're trying to shoot for too
far

269
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,069
unless you dnt kno magically come up
with you know some way to throw more

270
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:56,360
power more gain at the

271
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,649
at the problem and here's we just you
know run-through

272
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,649
logarithm rank with their and now you
add the numbers up and you've got a

273
00:16:04,649 --> 00:16:08,299
for you know 240 483 gigahertz at

274
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:14,579
was just twenty miles 130 dB with the
loss

275
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,860
so the total margin is the transmit
power

276
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,139
I liquor

277
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,360
for X

278
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,749
is unlikely since right

279
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:34,739
PSU typically start out with your
transmit power which issues expressed as

280
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:36,480
a positive number

281
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,759
you know plus 36 yr or so on depending
on how much power its

282
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:44,660
all this deals in in DBM but you know
it's too decibels microM or whatever you

283
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,819
want to do

284
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:50,910
on she start out with 36 TV and which I
believe is about for what CRP and have a

285
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,920
no those who would happen here

286
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,509
some other kind antenna home see get 36
TV in which is like I said amplifier

287
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:01,759
think it's a half what

288
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,000
not did certain on that and then here I
use to 23 TV icon for dishes

289
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,109
which I believe became an injury which
somebody bought something on other as a

290
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,260
fun stuff

291
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,800
you wind up with the 131 TV with the
path loss

292
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,000
and here this this 14 figure over here
is actually from the

293
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,599
amplifier their I with a lot of the
amplifiers out there that you down on a

294
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,720
tower have a preamplifier in them too

295
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,810
which which helps immensely when you're
dealing with the

296
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,980
the kinda collects loss figures you get
at microwave frequencies

297
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,450
you can't you you you wind up in this is
this

298
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,540
the Strait of word you can buy the
amplifier you can implement it

299
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,820
or you can buy really expensive
collection implemented yet and

300
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,240
both as a murdered I'm not really
attractive options were you have any

301
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,530
other way

302
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,580
so here did the total love the total
margin were set to forty seven dB

303
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,399
and you wind up with this initially a 59
sears is at

304
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,620
30 DB fade margin and this is a
seventeen-day be above

305
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,780
30 TV pretty well bet that this is
probably gonna be have been a fairly

306
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,170
a fairly reliable link the exception
that is of course if you wind up with

307
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,600
up other interference issues nearby

308
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,450
passive repeaters everybody gets his
brilliant idea to start working with the

309
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,220
stuff to sit here and say well

310
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,250
I just need to get from you know here to
hear Wow

311
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,360
I can take and put it dish you know down
here in the valley and pointed up to the

312
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,470
mountains and take two antennas connect
them back to back

313
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,030
and you know shoot 20 miles further
something like that

314
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,070
I you tend to run into a lot of this
with the the old stories if you know

315
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,790
people living down and valleys want to
pick up some TV station

316
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,340
you know they can put two up with two
antennas back to back in

317
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:51,060
sometimes an amplifier they're magically
now they can pick up the TV station

318
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,780
the problem with this is that you incur
twice the path loss

319
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:59,810
so you have the first path in the second
path that all had to be added together

320
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,149
and muster the courage i hears you wind
up with that

321
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,570
to wifi cards typically are going to
receive anything below $93

322
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,320
negative 93 dB so you see a hundred and

323
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,620
150 DBM their verses and and negative 93

324
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,160
you know you just not gonna see anything
there and on top of that

325
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,960
the noise for typically maybe you know
around a hundred db2

326
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,620
so yeah and and not workable is designed
for actually the the calm there is is

327
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,770
that generally only way this is going to
work as a for the is is very short

328
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:38,710
on I can't even examples of the top my
head but it's been done before

329
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,730
okay or use this information don't turn
Access Point power up

330
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,920
I know everybody in the brothers
reloading axis point with

331
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,000
you know some form of modified firmware
magically allows you to add a note on

332
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,050
some power in

333
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,649
and Tina communicate further but the
problem with this is that just like the

334
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,160
CB radios which used a.m.

335
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,930
he you turn up the power and it makes
the device nonlinear

336
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,730
you wind up causing all the side be
instant to come up all over the place

337
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:09,320
and he causes air france to other other
services and at the same time it also

338
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,550
causes interference

339
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:14,550
locally it make some of the other WiFi
channel something

340
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:19,919
not able to be used and of course SEC
liability because now

341
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,570
your radiating you know information out
there that's not useful

342
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:30,379
and it's in violation if you know
correct operation equipment

343
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,510
so here's here's a and screencap Ave for
all of this is a spectrum analyzer this

344
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,360
is a single you'd see

345
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,490
if you're looking an access point with
the spectrum analyzer

346
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,460
and you can see here that it's it's
fairly well-defined but

347
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,890
when you when you gonna turn the power
upon sleaze access points they don't

348
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,150
exactly behaved very well

349
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,090
and and you look at this use if you say
well that's not so bad to you realize

350
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,159
that you know

351
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,230
that signal that we're just looking at
was 22 megahertz wide

352
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,970
there sixty six megahertz with the
spectrum to to work with but I think

353
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,550
it's close to eighty three

354
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:08,659
but tell you wind up with interference
out in summer the sidebands and you

355
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,110
don't know where this is going to pop up

356
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:15,170
and you know it could wind up being on
adding in MDS is territory

357
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,290
on where you can have some TV engineer
who's you know chasing you around

358
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,649
with the I don't know rusty Spyker
something for your free with that but

359
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,880
he he's probably not afraid to call the
SEC either

360
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,940
and yet he just white white my keep the
stuff claimed just

361
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,710
you know to keep the SEC of retailing if
for some reason you decide to implement

362
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,950
this in

363
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,840
it's it's just one less thing to worry
about on it's just really good idea to

364
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,649
get engineering practice

365
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,270
and this is a picture worth Zilla which
some you may know the a hacker pimps and

366
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,430
they decided to I guess overclock and
whatever

367
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,870
amplify the heck out in this thing this
this was their first model but I fears

368
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:03,870
that they're working on an updated
version

369
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,500
but in general if you're gonna turn
Access Point power up your

370
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,760
you want to keep it is as close to

371
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,350
me know with within a few moments
because you want to limit the

372
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,530
nonlinearity the the device is good

373
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,360
the manager fairest in all ways it's
gonna generate so typically no more the

374
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,040
you know 100 percent if you're if you're

375
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,210
if you get a twenty-one Milan device and
you know the

376
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:29,650
they say the unit 100 know a lot about
it it's probably not a good idea to push

377
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:32,350
in 150 know what's

378
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,640
mend and again thou dost it is a little
11g can be ample finally cater to learn

379
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,260
be there are GMT fires out there now

380
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,950
you just probably need to read the
documentation that comes with it

381
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:48,920
and I took a spectral plot here have a
headed to 11g

382
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,760
at to make her super division on it HP
141 tea which is a really old spectrum

383
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,010
analyzer

384
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:59,240
and distributing a bit for me did
together this particular picture but

385
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,400
what kinda blew my mind as I may not
have been operating exactly correctly

386
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,960
but

387
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,210
this is a two to 11 G and that center
211 be

388
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,260
and if you look at the two you really
can't tell who are different

389
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,310
so but again that's just looking at the
spectral plot

390
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,120
and here's a another image which is just
on

391
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,600
slightly less 3802 11g at five nigger to
Division

392
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,880
so you see in the same picture just
slightly compressed

393
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,680
alright so you're for Nelson's is is the
way you you express

394
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,570
out where your signals at when you're
you're putting up a link between two

395
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:37,399
places

396
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,770
%uh you know the signals got a fit
somewhere in it it turns out that that

397
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,450
his lips becomes easier

398
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,390
so you have a dish one in addition the
other end and you know you've got all

399
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,250
the space in between

400
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,750
and typically most links are calculated
to the first for nails on which is

401
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:55,400
he called dot 6 and that's where about
60 percent of the

402
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,300
signal is and and again like it says no
churches can be tolerated

403
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,200
com when you're working with WiFi the
power levels are so low

404
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,220
and and you gain is a is typically
fairly high value

405
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,660
you wind up with the you know something
with you know trees or anything like

406
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,820
that

407
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,419
you can throw power at the problem but
the next thing you know it's raining now

408
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,150
the trees are

409
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,740
or where and your your signal will go
through its microwave it's pretty much

410
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:26,500
one site stuff

411
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,630
and out so ideally the second her for
Nelson should be should be clear

412
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,720
that time don't remember

413
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,230
I think the you can catch a leaders out
I think it's like a either

414
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,380
on it's either to 43 it's either one or
something else but

415
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,870
it's it's typically you know expressed
as is where all the where that signal

416
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,560
actually resides in the here between
those two points

417
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,370
marymount high five courses is is
important because you don't want to

418
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:58,140
you don't mind it with multi-path
interference which is where the single

419
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:00,080
bounces off the ground and

420
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,330
incomes up in a casa some sort your
friends at the same time

421
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,120
you've got to clear the ground so you
you've got to make sure that you don't

422
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,660
want it with the for Nelson actually
coming in contact with the ground

423
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,790
and of course you're down to on the
economic see you generally don't know

424
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:19,590
26 for additional 350 feet and miss you
can actually afford to do so

425
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,669
ominous extradition fifty feet isn't
nearly as expensive

426
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:30,080
and also a horizontal polarization tends
to help out with some multi-path

427
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,300
are what you wind up with this is that
when the signal bounces off the ground

428
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:40,830
when it comes back up it he kinda for
knowles out

429
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:45,010
and and obviously also have to deal with
the the curvature the earth because

430
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:48,250
you know the earth is round in the wind
up with

431
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,390
trying to communicate between two points
you've got to deal with this balls in

432
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,660
the middle

433
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:58,770
and here's a a formula for calculating
that

434
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,460
which you you work out with the you know
this isn't

435
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,990
this isn'ta too bad here you've got 61
see where the first Bolch

436
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,600
not been in a 20 mile path which

437
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,290
signals I am it's that exercise infidels
on on my stick

438
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:22,500
okay now we've actually got the the
earth culture see you can you can tell

439
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,530
that if you were dealing with the past
that you just had

440
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,879
you know two towers in the local Homer
something you know her feet tall

441
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,380
are you know you could still wind up
with the dealing with a an obscure a she

442
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,110
here

443
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,780
because see if you're 100 feet up and
the earth balls is 112 feet obviously

444
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,200
your during have a an obscure for Nelson

445
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,850
any and all this fun stuff up together
anyone that with the actual minimum

446
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:51,950
on mounting height which is necessary
from on the internet which in this case

447
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,930
if you're over flat ground

448
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:57,820
you should probably put it up around
about 190 feet but that's a

449
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,710
that's getting close to the point we
have to start lighting towers

450
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:06,450
200 feet not if you're wrecking a tower
if it's if it's a two hundred feet not

451
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,740
be have to register with the SEC and the
FAA

452
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,140
Tom the altar to light the tower because
it now becomes an aviation hazard

453
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,380
depending on where you're at if you're
close to an airport you at the light it

454
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,820
anyway

455
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,379
out but again this is somebody trivia
here is that if using strobe switch EE

456
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,740
you know few you drive by you see some
TV tower there

457
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,160
if you see the resistor up sometimes the
end the the tower itself will just be

458
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:35,580
you know painted either neutral cow the
colorful world issue nobody Raider metal

459
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,199
color

460
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,950
and the reason why this is because you
have to pay me because a stretcher on 24

461
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,500
hours a day

462
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,920
on the counter that is that if you
decide to like the tower it has to be

463
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:45,790
painted

464
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:51,270
the alternating origin in red so that
you know pilots actually notice it

465
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,330
and it's expensive to keep up the tower
to because those

466
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,260
those lights pretty well have to run
24/7 and if their offer any reason you

467
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,000
have to

468
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,430
call the FAA and the issue a notice to
airmen to say hey you're tower lights

469
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,420
are out

470
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,760
and defines on the stuff for free
expensive to I

471
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,710
growing at nearly as bad as causing
interference but when you start messing

472
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,910
with I'm

473
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:15,250
you know airlines in here traffic no
arrests that stuff they

474
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,080
it really kinda bothered about that

475
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,790
when I got into this stuff we were
advised that the the gold standard was a

476
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,010
half one amplifier in ADB I only

477
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:30,320
the res minus was it because when you
deal with a a 50 TV I'll army

478
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,450
you want with your signal on typically
shooting over the customer's data

479
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,010
services to customers

480
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:39,610
and if you put a half one amplifier
under that if you exceed the ERP

481
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,770
are limited for what's so we're always
advise you know have fun amplifier

482
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,870
and now in this a DVI harmony with the
assumption there be about a DB worth

483
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,670
over

484
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,290
loss in the connectors Niko axe and in
this is pushing it really close

485
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,170
but the you know it works

486
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,230
and then again down here at the bottom
is is a kind of an explanation apart 15

487
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,730
as far as

488
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,120
are what did the rule there is if you
try and re decided the verbiage

489
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:14,960
its its kinda difficult just because its
children and in just about

490
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,970
legally is so

491
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:23,280
and and won the reasons why it's so
complicated is because they wanted to be

492
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,980
able to use the spectrum its part 15 its
kinda given to the people

493
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,550
but the limitation is that date
typically don't want anybody monopolize

494
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,500
it even though it's

495
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,770
its non-licensed service and there are
there are

496
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,320
actually satellites and other users that
that have access to some of the spectrum

497
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,120
particularly

498
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,080
there's a couple ham radio satellites
out there which operate on two before

499
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,179
getting hurts but they're

500
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,400
there toward the low into the band so
they're largely not a concern for

501
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,360
anybody who's working in a part 15
implementation

502
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,050
no fun

503
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,460
somewhere along the way I ran across
this in 10 felt a honeydew included but

504
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,530
this is basically

505
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,670
how much can you get on a given day
wishing everyone a brother is seen

506
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:05,750
somebody has got somewhere

507
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,050
this ole seve and satellite dish and he
is a very low gave you say the nice if

508
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,560
you could use that again

509
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,740
and it turns out that you can it work on
244 gigahertz

510
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,950
I'll definitely give you one more game
than you know that Dunlop barbecue grill

511
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,220
dish

512
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,540
but you can actually figure this stuff
up pretty easily just based on

513
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,690
on how big that dishes and and obviously
here is a formula we calculate up

514
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:34,820
a4 a four foot dish and and here comes
at 2:27 de Leon

515
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,510
but to you know you just plug in
whatever the size is the you want you

516
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,129
know they're 26 for additional you know
5-foot-2 she dresses that and

517
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,760
you can come with an accurate gain
figure here the other point to note is

518
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,920
sears is specifically the frequency that
involved %ah

519
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,290
if you working with something like an
the

520
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,059
DirecTV or Dish you need those services
which operate and KU

521
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:01,300
are you wind up with a lot more games
and a given dish

522
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,680
then you would and don't see van doren
to

523
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,510
a 2.4 gigahertz

524
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:12,550
and again the the antenna beam with this
is typically defined designer

525
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:17,409
is degrees between on -3 DB points which
is basically half your power so if you

526
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,080
change many have one out

527
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,909
then it will be apparent that at the
edges the beam that you've got you know

528
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:30,910
was a quarter what left or you know 3d
be down

529
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,430
and and he regatta a formula for
calculating antenna beam with which is

530
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,540
really useful

531
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,809
because we're dealing with just some
random dish you want to know whether or

532
00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:41,330
not

533
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:45,010
you know how how just how precise do you
have to have that in 10 appointed and

534
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,930
whether or not

535
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:49,470
hi you're actually be able to
communicate you know outside that range

536
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,990
by any stretch

537
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,280
and in this particular example for food
dish is going to be six degrees wide

538
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,340
which you works out okay on

539
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,580
but if you're trying to communicate
outside at six degree window

540
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,790
need you're gonna have a lot of
difficulty doing so typically

541
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,530
the wifi she at record which insure
everybody was where I was was a 120

542
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:13,899
120 4.9 miles and 12-foot issued one and

543
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:19,680
a 10-foot dishes the other hand to six
thousand foot peaks

544
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,870
apart a problem with this is a you start
putting all the stuff together

545
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,170
and he won it with the 37 TV I'd issued
one and

546
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,840
and 35 tv dish at the other end which

547
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,090
thats fair sized ish are but

548
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,770
the path loss per cent 246 TV which you
know doesn't seem like it's too terribly

549
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,809
much but

550
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:42,280
you can one-up can fix some things close
here fortunately they had taken of

551
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,100
antennas enough power than it really was
an issue for them

552
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,400
because it turns out that if you work
this back you wanna with the negative

553
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,870
4942

554
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,200
on BB margin here well then that would
be the

555
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,710
the received signal strength now when I
left out some stuff obviously any

556
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,510
any sort relax loss and the actual
mother measured strength that the guys

557
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,280
picked up out there was named a 50 TV
MCV

558
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,430
you can see this pretty well correlates

559
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:16,080
oh yeah and and down in nashville around
the third week of October

560
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,380
I they had this wonderful convention
called Freaknik

561
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,750
thereby should check it out

562
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,840
ira it but the other the other point
here is is that it I didn't wanna

563
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,010
NY just make a specific to that the
actual formula presented here is is you

564
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,220
know for path loss it really doesn't
matter exactly

565
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,270
what frequency do it at you can still

566
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,760
plug values in and come up with path
loss for other frequencies

567
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,140
particularly if you wanted to do like
low-power FM or something here

568
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,590
you just plug in your values for you
know he megahertz in a wide

569
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,970
and you know you can work this out the
you you wind up with the

570
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,110
58 DB worth the signal here in and then
you just have to figure out exactly what

571
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,570
sensitive your car stereo has

572
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,389
I actually tried to research this and
and maybe I just haven't mastered Google

573
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,440
but I couldn't find anybody who actually
published how sensitive

574
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,210
their car stereo receiver was so I just
plugged in something here which is your

575
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,050
your typical ham radio HD

576
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:17,270
would do that you know 100 DBM 120 DBM

577
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,770
but you tend to run the issues with the
noise floor which maybe 834

578
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,290
im actually higher depending on what
site here at

579
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,340
I also wanted to to run a practical
example here that

580
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,679
I guess it would be a lot easier to
visualize are

581
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:35,889
so I i grab some convenient informati
and

582
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,950
been through together would be a path
between a TV tower

583
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,418
radio station tower because you know the
FCC's media website can actually

584
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,618
type in somebody's call letters and get
all the antenna hide information you

585
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,230
need

586
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,710
and you can plug it into you know your
examples and everything for NYE samples

587
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,990
with the formulas

588
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:57,670
and and determine what your which are
trying to get here

589
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,119
so this is a path between a six
hundred-foot tower in one thousand foot

590
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,650
tower

591
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,850
approximately over 70 miles I believe

592
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,380
and and which one up with here is is
that the state of Alabama fortunately is

593
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,590
fairly flat

594
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,030
but there still is a rich there in the
middle and

595
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,880
pussy at 2.4 gigahertz this isn't a bad
path

596
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,330
you can see the for Nelson comes pretty
close their abandon 900 megahertz that

597
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,869
actually comes in ops curation

598
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:30,410
UK I also wanted to see

599
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:37,410
figures

600
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:44,030
yeah okay so how to decide to throw
together some extreme examples just for

601
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:47,290
the hell of it because I didn't figure
anybody would actually crazy enough to

602
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:48,849
use a 24-foot dish but

603
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:52,000
I just wanted to find it with the
numbers would be like

604
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,890
you work this back to be fine after that
24 dish ones are being 43 DVI internet

605
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,970
which is fairly high for an antenna

606
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,099
by the condo this is that now you wind
up with being with

607
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,310
only one degree and it's very difficult
to keep an antenna like this

608
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,290
point when you're dealing with the with
satellite you know the teleports in

609
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:15,420
and satellite earth stations actually
you know the people who uploader

610
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,630
uploaded to who actually push HBO to the
to the satellite

611
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,280
they typically have very large antennas
their your quick to tracking systems

612
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,410
to automatically keep that the point
exactly where it is

613
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,629
and it's also difficult to keep some
mountainous removing on their own

614
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,180
particular if they happen to be in the

615
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:39,828
anywhere in the the Pacific Rim and and
again the higher the frequency the more

616
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:41,569
game you're gonna wanna without the dish

617
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:45,109
the end the old ATT microwave dishes

618
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:48,960
I exhibit quite a bit in game 2 and of
course they had huge towers that they're

619
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,700
mounted on

620
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,700
the part about those is that they were
designed to be generic enough that they

621
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,480
were able to

622
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,300
to use them over three different bands
on including on

623
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,319
a very was assessed ATM

624
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,060
less than a degree are worth the beam
with here so if

625
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,430
if editors pointed you know directly
ahead

626
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,609
you wind up with you know losing that
signal if you're

627
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:16,700
you know of by a degree which you know
obviously meant its gonna be pointed

628
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,619
their kept their

629
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,520
say hi I just I just picked this up I
don't know you know

630
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,660
maybe somebody here might have an
interest in telephony I know I do

631
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,118
but I found out that somebody's in
tennis of

632
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,599
there's a lot of talk because these the
tower sites have 82 no neurons that for

633
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:34,250
the most part

634
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,040
and other companies if have bought them
up and sold them Brenneman so much there

635
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,970
was remove these

636
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:42,010
these antennas because they're huge and
their heavy too

637
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,990
and it turns out that that antenna you
look at it you say was not that big

638
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,270
bullets you know 100 feet away from me
vertically

639
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:51,700
are some other way about a hundred pound
some other way but twenty-five hundred

640
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,329
pounds

641
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:58,369
so there's there's fiscal mass here to
keep them from moving another good part

642
00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:02,280
about to AT&T was as they pretty well
figured out that to early on

643
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,339
says he only had so much back to work
with the Reeses me channels as possible

644
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:09,410
it's also a very good lesson learned
anytime you're doing

645
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:14,399
on Wireless point to point wink because
you don't wanna have something operating

646
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,040
on channel one and wind up you know

647
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,130
not being able to use that two towers
down are

648
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:23,180
or worse finding out the your
interference you're getting on one link

649
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,480
is because another link that you
establish

650
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,619
sixty miles away so

651
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:32,250
obviously 18 2013 live here to make sure
that

652
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:36,670
they had more money than God did to
implement this but you make sure you for

653
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,680
Nelson's clear

654
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,000
and they have highly directional antenna
so that they pre-war know that signals

655
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,780
not going where they don't want it to be

656
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:47,130
and relatively low power radiance here
but they had the mother of all combining

657
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,790
systems

658
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:52,660
and here here's a good example that just
pulled into some mom

659
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,348
some old AT&T literature you can
actually see there will be more let's

660
00:38:56,349 --> 00:38:57,740
make sure that the path is

661
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:02,380
is always remaining you know it's offset
so that you don't wanna with one station

662
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,319
shooting into another

663
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:07,829
and and again you want with a realistic
gonna

664
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:11,960
limits here distance is the largest
governing factor but it's mostly due to

665
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,730
the timing algorithms that are you new
to live in BNG

666
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,140
I you know even even it to even 55 miles

667
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,480
they were only able to to maintain than
150 kilobits

668
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,380
but that's because they were trying to
communicate 1 megabit when you

669
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:31,040
the earlier cars when you lowered the
speed day actually got more sensitive

670
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,050
on so you were able to make a marginal
path work further

671
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,069
on but it the

672
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:40,470
at the the wifi shoot at I believe they
were trying to run full rein I don't

673
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:44,180
remember exactly what their numbers were
as far as has what they were able to get

674
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,049
out of them I'm

675
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,880
I'm really interested to know and of
course the other issue dealing with here

676
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,970
is is that radio

677
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:54,540
at least as far as most wifi is
implemented is pretty much have to

678
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,099
blacks

679
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:59,280
to transmit now you waiting you know you
receive and in turn around do the same

680
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,700
thing

681
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:04,550
because %uh this you know 11 magnets
doesn't really work at 11 megabits the

682
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:07,869
your actual throughput in a typically
around 4.5

683
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:11,940
5 megabits maybe about the best to get
in and a point to point link with no

684
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,680
interference

685
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,680
and anytime that you're you're
implementing it went like this: euros

686
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,290
why do a site survey

687
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:22,920
on just it to come to get a feel for the
site figure out whether or not you're

688
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,930
going to be election make this work

689
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,089
obviously some towers are not as good as
other towers because you can tell that

690
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:33,779
this was probably fairly well use to

691
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:36,930
because somebody's got a bunch going to
stick it in every which direction it

692
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,270
looks like on the same day and at the
same polarization

693
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:44,930
on you know if I was setting up a point
to point link for a wireless ISP

694
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,299
War II something that I want to be
reliable I'd be really concerned about

695
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,490
using this site until I found out more
details about you know

696
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,609
what was going on at this particular
site

697
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,630
and and again you went out with they're
not all wireless is compatible

698
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,580
he you also have this this wonderful fun
not be at were you have

699
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,270
a direct sequence versus I spread
specter she may direct sequence spread

700
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,730
spectrum for strippers hopping spread
spectrum

701
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,170
well from party hopping pretty much
always wins but it's it's a

702
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,330
it's it's not a very good victory
because there only able to communicate

703
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:18,869
because they're slightly more air france
resistant

704
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:23,210
Durex Inc once you know you you can to
keep it until it falls off

705
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,930
and frequency hopping he just kind of
wind up in this is triangular path where

706
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:33,500
are a you're still able to communicate
with more noise but

707
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,210
its is just not very effective
directions which is kinda drops of all

708
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:38,060
the other

709
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,349
and and there's there's kids out there
and I said avail what your favorite

710
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:43,080
retail outlet but to

711
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,580
II I found these once in a friend a ride
on the website that I I found it happen

712
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,490
you can get a sitter typically there
there are some are

713
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:55,040
there some spectrum analyzer cars out
there you can actually use actually five

714
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,619
I think from enrich your for some the
other ones

715
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:06,369
okay the at three thousand dollars from
cokie are you getting this is a spectrum

716
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:07,530
analyzer card

717
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,830
there are some wifi cards out there that
have the ability to try to do the same

718
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:12,109
thing

719
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:15,609
but its it's not very not very good but
will work in a pinch

720
00:42:15,609 --> 00:42:22,609
not for a lot cheaper but really
spectrum analyzers the best way to go

721
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,420
well even probably canyon is a spectrum
analyzer

722
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,849
for two before he returned Redbox he is
remembered that you know the people at

723
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,180
home unfortunately can always hear the
back

724
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,779
are by it may weigh about seventy pounds
do you really want to be like in

725
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,569
something that will

726
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:44,650
call ought to see that arm

727
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:47,500
but you know typically when I like a
spectrum analyzer I'm looking at some

728
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,849
peace if you know HP gear did

729
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:53,630
you know is in typically not very
portable will get the job done we'll

730
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,299
show you everything you need to know

731
00:42:55,299 --> 00:42:59,599
I but on the flip side it's it's
typically not reportable that something

732
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,380
like that you're going to give you know
shopping at Dayton for in those early I

733
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,599
think about 600 bucks last time I looked

734
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,569
but certainly spectrum analyzer cards
here you could you take a look at and

735
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:07,930
what

736
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:11,299
what the channel utilization is here and
obviously you can see

737
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:14,599
than this particular example that looks
like channel one spree will clear there

738
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:15,109
some

739
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:18,299
something on time you know between
channel 29

740
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:24,839
and obviously something something else
altogether that the high in there

741
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,078
and here's another site were you can see
the obviously looks like there's

742
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,549
somebody probably on

743
00:43:30,549 --> 00:43:33,890
I think about channel to worse I'll yeah
the channel to

744
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:38,890
because I the wonderful fun part about
wifi gs3 non-overlapping channels which

745
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:39,910
is typically

746
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,890
16 in 11 and if you offset that just
slightly the

747
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:47,430
it always starts at the the bottom into
the bay and

748
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:50,790
so that when your own on channel one
you're working with like 24

749
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:54,060
are 2.400 gigahertz

750
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:57,569
%ah plus 22 megahertz is is the total

751
00:43:57,569 --> 00:44:01,040
utilization there she want up the
channel one signal actually goes across

752
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,250
you channels 135

753
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,270
in this particular case you can see that
you implementing

754
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,680
channel and a hater up would probably be
a much better idea than trying to

755
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,549
influence on the channel water channel
two

756
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:15,450
because you're gonna run interference

757
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:18,990
and here you just gonna a really crappy
site here wheres apparently somebody

758
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,520
who's all over the place

759
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,170
as you can see even two channels a
really bad and arrested channels are

760
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:24,890
okay

761
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:28,970
if you want to deal with the some other
the other two people forget her to quit

762
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,650
my Western multiplex which is purely
pushy

763
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,859
data you know t1 data I they don't
really care quite so much because

764
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:36,830
modulation

765
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:40,859
format is recognized so to to wifi it
looks like pure no one's

766
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:44,380
and to them for the most part we look
the same way to them we just look as

767
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,119
another noise source

768
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,619
and then here's a really crummy site
which is you can see most advanced

769
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:52,530
pretty well shot here

770
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:59,250
that's definitely not summer you want to
try to employ many swirl am awake

771
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,690
so when you're doing site surveys you
can also use a free software to put some

772
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:06,020
other stuff together this program out
there called Radio Mobile

773
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:09,910
which is put together idly by Canadian
gentleman and in a fun part about this

774
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:11,250
is when you're

775
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,780
he just wanna roughly Cana look at
something

776
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,099
you can always use Google Earth to home
which in my case I was able

777
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:23,109
I was able to run path analysis and then
find a sub secure a she

778
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:26,589
but I couldn't actually determine where
the hell plus

779
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:33,589
I looked on the map and I couldn't see
anything that that stuck out at me

780
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:43,810
okay

781
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,450
say average with Radio Mobile you can
you download it for free of the Internet

782
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,140
I haven't really succeeded in getting it
worked too well but the nice part about

783
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,259
this is that sometimes if you go

784
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,470
on I think it's a of

785
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,650
wanna the the the one wonderful federal
agencies out there that came up with all

786
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,090
this data decided that they needed to
charge to distribute it or something

787
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:08,160
and it turns out that Radio Mobile works
perfectly well with the shuttle

788
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,310
are greater topography Mission SRTM
which is available for free from nasa

789
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:16,779
see you can download all the stuff feed
into it or just tell it to get it over

790
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,030
the Internet and you can you can t

791
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:22,710
do path loss analysis with it you can
also throw in an army

792
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:26,380
and say you know I'd like to know
exactly what's our coverage I should

793
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:26,830
have

794
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:29,569
assuming you don't really have much
interference suitable for getting her

795
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:30,560
she prolly enough

796
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,420
wind up dealing with the you know
somebody's wireless access point in the

797
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:35,790
countryside somewhere

798
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:42,040
that one's a causing an issue for your
network any Google Earth Google Earth is

799
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,850
is really fun to play with you know it's
pretty on

800
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,440
but it's also it's also very simple you
just use the measuring tool put in your

801
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,250
two points

802
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,130
and this also helps if you have to climb
a tower because you can

803
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:58,450
trying to get a look as to exactly what
sorta features a trainee really looking

804
00:46:58,450 --> 00:46:58,770
at

805
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:05,770
although it may not help you so much for
buildings her

806
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:30,169
that is a really bad picture a telephone
tower used to live near

807
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:34,419
on but this happens beyond the same out
that I tried to plot some other stuff at

808
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:37,549
so if you give me a second here I'm
gonna try and see what I do make a sweet

809
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:38,969
roll back so I can actually

810
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:45,969
on show this really well

811
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:04,190
for

812
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,250
in my so basically you just one abusing
your %ah

813
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,340
using the measuring tool you put in your
two points you draw a line between them

814
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,130
and then you can if can grab the mapping
given a push

815
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,580
and and Google earth will just kinda
start you know following along

816
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,660
and what you do is is %eh you you keep a
watch in the lower right hand corner in

817
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,470
it'll indicate the altitude of the point
that the cursor is over

818
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,540
and where this is really useful is is
that when you're you're doing something

819
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,580
like I was doing rush trying to find out
where that stupid Ridge was

820
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,620
you can kinda watcher elevation as you
follow that path and you

821
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,620
you have to to to grab the image removal
little too

822
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,049
to keep following that path but you just
keep a watch in and you'll typically

823
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:47,840
find it you know if you if you doing
with the path for you've got

824
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,490
thousand-foot mountain one and two
thousand-foot mountain on the other

825
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,330
and everything in between is you know
500 600 700 feet

826
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,009
you pretty will notice when you hit a
one thousand-foot peak in the middle

827
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:58,410
that

828
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,950
even though it may only be you know just
a a few miles wide

829
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:05,440
but you'll be able to see the obvious
jump in altitude there

830
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,520
which really helps you trying to locate
something you know that for whatever

831
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:16,520
reason to shop for your total maps
otherwise

832
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:25,360
are and I had to throw some stuff in
here because

833
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,810
will everybody just loves you know for

834
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,390
interception all arrested in it after
reason why we're here because it's

835
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,190
really neat fun to play with WiFi

836
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:37,510
armed but somewhere along the way I
picked up a little factory which isn't

837
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,540
the typical passive interception

838
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:44,110
distance is about three times at need to
pass information directionally so

839
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,200
provide direction rather so if you have
the link that

840
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,790
runs you know one-mile it may be
possible actually taken the day doubt of

841
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:51,190
that

842
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:55,640
you know for three miles in and in this
bitch really fun interesting to restart

843
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,650
deal with the termite dishes you know
the old

844
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:01,110
satellite dishes stuff like that you
cannot

845
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:05,060
if you look at the and a DSS dish

846
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:10,060
it looks really weird but it turns out
that then dishes actually just

847
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,340
1/2 love that big satellite dishes at
work

848
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:16,340
if you cut the thing down the middle
you've got your focus point and then

849
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,390
you've got the reflector

850
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,069
but only looks like have fun the really
nice part about this is that you can

851
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:22,400
essentially put a link up

852
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,030
where you know the feed one point of One
Direction

853
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:29,500
but you're actually communicating in
another direction so it be possible to

854
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,850
sit down with the

855
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:34,670
an offset dish and actually pointed
across the road in your neighbors

856
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,030
live-fire wherever

857
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:39,670
and they may actually think you're
trying to pick up you know satellite

858
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:44,020
and course you can also do wonderful fun
stuff you start throwing not

859
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:47,530
disassociation frames in the next to you
know you can deal with a man in the

860
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:47,920
middle

861
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,000
and not grab somebody's working RSS fun
stuff

862
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,990
so

863
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:59,330
I'm this is done kinda the individ- to

864
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,330
I'm appreciate everybody coming to talk
im

865
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:05,690
really honored that they even gave me a
speaker slot here on apologize for being

866
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,410
such an awful speaker but to

867
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,710
no ma'am a little bit better this
particular the biggest crowd ever in

868
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,610
front so

869
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:18,610
thanks for the opportunity

870
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,200
we have any questions

871
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:29,020
to thanks
