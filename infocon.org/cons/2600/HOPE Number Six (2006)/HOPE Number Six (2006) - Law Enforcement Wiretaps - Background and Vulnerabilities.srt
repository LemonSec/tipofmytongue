1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,949
but we had equipment to sort out this
next is %ah

2
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:07,690
law enforcement wiretaps background and
Boulder abilities

3
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,750
with numbers 9141 23 and ninety

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,880
I'm not a number in the freeman

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,009
the so

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,039
%uh talking about how law enforcement
wiretaps

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,410
actually work I'm at blaze

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,469
sandy Clark on my cashier

9
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,180
and Eric kronen are we're at the
University of Pennsylvania

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,829
I most to this work has been published
already but and it also available on the

11
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,329
web so

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,190
what we're on really looking at is the
question of not

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,879
how to arm how can you wire taps
somebody

14
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,419
but a slightly different question the 11
usually F

15
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,920
which is if law enforcement or somebody
who's

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,260
doing wiretaps to create a legal record
what's going on

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,658
are are trainee use technology to do
this

18
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,799
how might that technology fail that is

19
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,840
not how could you defeat a wiretap in
theory

20
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,170
but based on the actual technology that
law enforcement agencies are using to do

21
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,150
wiretapping

22
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,799
how on you how might that fail or their
vulnerabilities in the system's

23
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,259
no course all about says hackers know
that the you know without even looking

24
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,270
at the technology we know the answer is
yes

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,399
because all complicated systems have
bugs in them

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,960
but these systems that haven't really
been scrutinized very much

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,930
and we think we may be the first people
in least in the open community

28
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,770
to have gotten ahold love law
enforcement wiretap systems

29
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:45,960
and really scrutinize them ought to find
out whether the records there

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,369
collecting are in fact accurate so

31
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm just a quick primer on wiretap law
in the US

32
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,729
basically law enforcement agencies do
two kinds of wiretaps

33
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,259
under the law the law says they're
really these two broad categories a

34
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,130
wiretap few

35
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,179
you can do went for the pen register and
that's a

36
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,020
kinda wiretap that's intended to be the
least intrusive con

37
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,390
where they can just find out what
numbers you're calling

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,800
there's an analogous people to trap and
trace where they find out what numbers

39
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,599
called you

40
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,700
on it's a relatively low legal barrier
to get one of these things basically all

41
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,370
they have to do is gonna fees in the
making a wiretap order

42
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:29,810
a pen register kind against if they
actually a probable cause

43
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,069
that you might be committing a a

44
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,190
a crime they can get what's called a
title 3

45
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,920
wiretap 40 full content wiretap where
they don't just find out what digits

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,580
you're dialing

47
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,040
but they also get to listen to your
phone calls and

48
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,190
thats not just a higher legal standard
but it also means

49
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,359
somebody else to sit there and listen to
the calls so according to the published

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
statistics on wiretaps most wiretaps

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,989
are the pen register kind not the full
content

52
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:04,450
now interestingly from a technological
point de vue

53
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,120
this distinction is meaningless because
they use the same technology to

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,080
implement both

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,830
they just run off the record audio
feature when they have

56
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,970
just a pen register water so these the
same basic equipment to do both times

57
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,349
I've

58
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:20,730
caps now am

59
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,040
they're going to different ways they can
do this one is passed the telephone

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,970
company for the records of who you call

61
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,040
that only helps them with your past
traffic it doesn't give them real time

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,730
access

63
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,709
another way they can do this is with a
technology called a loop extender

64
00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:39,299
in which they basically physically hook
up something to your phone line

65
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:42,860
and it basically makes a copy of
everything on your phone line and sends

66
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,430
it back to headquarters

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,989
arm on on on what they call him

68
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,349
law enforcement terminology a second
friendly line

69
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,400
are that goes from your phone line back
to the 14 smidgen see

70
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,900
on that technology is about fifty years
old it's still in use

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,360
but from it's been largely supplanted

72
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,080
UF by standard interface that in the
1990s phone companies were required

73
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,750
have called Coolio worthy jst

74
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,780
25-day basically is a standard
wiretapping spying interface that has to

75
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,410
be built into every phone switch

76
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,829
on and its also can use for both full

77
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,300
audio taps and for arm just the pen
register

78
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,740
now interestingly um the because

79
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,440
law enforcement agencies have all this
tape recording equipment

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,610
want to the pressures on them was to
keep kaliya

81
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,500
systems compatible with the older
systems now we all know that

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,830
compatibility means compatibility with
all the old books

83
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,639
so it turns out that a lot of what we're
going to talk about about Luke expanders

84
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,669
will apply

85
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:50,830
to kaliya systems because they have both
compatibility

86
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:54,530
built into it so just a quick review for
those of you who

87
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,970
on aren't telephone enthusiasts this
will be new for those who are telephone

88
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,100
enthusiast

89
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,419
you know basically are pops telephone
system aims to provide a kind

90
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:08,419
I this ideally high-t_ between

91
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:11,490
to telephones and we crypto people call
them

92
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,199
Alice and Bob you can use any names you
want for the two phones

93
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,669
palace once called bob she basically
signals over

94
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,580
over a dedicated circuit to her central
office

95
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,750
the central office to code speed dialing
signals

96
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,150
outcalls bob's central office bob
central office

97
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,419
rings Bob's phone and they get and it is
a virtual circuit what's going on

98
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,789
will talk about how that's implemented
are a little more but

99
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:41,419
just very briefly the interface between

100
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,620
you and your from and the telephone
companies

101
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,160
thing that's about a hundred years old
basic standards

102
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,979
take back way way back their two wires
that are

103
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:56,508
private between your phone and the
central office

104
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,030
on it's this ingenious interface with
two wires

105
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,039
have lots of different kinds of signals
on them

106
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,120
it supplies power back to your telephone
48 volt DC

107
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,370
there's a current loop on that
forty-eight full PC when there's a load

108
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,690
on at the central office to text that
you've picked up the phone

109
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,160
because the circuit closes when you pick
up your your telephone

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,160
during the call or while your phone is
off the hook

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,630
audio AC signals are superimposed on
papa that

112
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,110
while a call is going on those audio
signals or content

113
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,830
but before the call is taking place
while you've gotten a dial tone

114
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:34,729
those audio signals are signaling to
tell the phone company what numbers your

115
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:35,270
call

116
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,508
using touchstone dialing on so

117
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:43,009
its it's this ingenious multiplex
interface that tries to squeeze as many

118
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,270
functions

119
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,460
out at least two wires as possible arm

120
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,630
so if you want to tap someone's phone
you have

121
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,270
many many different options the wire
tapper has

122
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,889
a huge range of possibilities so one
possibility

123
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,470
is to arm go to the local loop those two
wires get access to someone Klein their

124
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,560
phone poll go down the manhole

125
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,759
going to their phone closet if they're
up their place

126
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,780
or go to the somewhere near the central
office get access to those two wires

127
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,949
and you know hook up a tape recorder or
a radio transmitter or something like

128
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:19,150
that to it

129
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,440
arm if the target is using a cordless
phone you might intercept the RF coming

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,979
out a cordless phone

131
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:29,659
arm or if they're using cellphone you
might enter you make

132
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,020
intercept the radio signals there you
might go to the central office and

133
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,340
tapped the phone their

134
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,479
if they're making only calls between
central offices are long distance calls

135
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,219
you might tap

136
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,509
the interoffice trumps and tap their
phone there

137
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:48,560
you know they're they're practically
infinite range of possible ways

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,319
someone wants to wiretap might do it
we're interested

139
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,800
not in all of the possible ways you
could wiretap but very specifically

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,949
what law enforcement agencies actually

141
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,330
shoes to do and what are the possible
implications some

142
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,560
those design choices so on to be that we
wanted to get some

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,949
wiretap equipment so it turns out that
arm

144
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,090
in the United States position of
equipment that is primarily useful for

145
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:17,310
the 35th

146
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,440
interception love wire communications

147
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,780
is um illegal and it's one of those
really bad

148
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,919
felonies to be convicted is a a local
eighteen US Code 25-12

149
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,449
don't ever get convicted on you go to
jail for a long time it's really really

150
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,070
bad

151
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,580
have wiretapping equipment on if you're
not supposed to have it

152
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,500
on and you know worse because at this
crime you can't just called the

153
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,970
companies that sell the equipment to law
enforcement agencies and by them

154
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,010
first people they're very expensive and
technical its supposedly illegal

155
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,230
so we had to go to e-bay on

156
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,690
on

157
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:59,950
arm so

158
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,870
oMG it turns out that law enforcement
agencies when they

159
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:08,120
have extra wiretap equipment they do the
same thing you do when you have an extra

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,080
stereo

161
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,610
on they am I they sell it on ebay

162
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,480
and I spent about a month I found out
the it turns out that the secret to

163
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,740
getting the stuff on eBay is to just
find out what the manufacturers avitar

164
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:24,420
look for for for them /url evil
companies in all the fellas wiretap

165
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,189
so you note the Ocala Florida police
department remember that we've got a lot

166
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,060
of their stuff

167
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,300
the Chicago Police Department sold %uh
some digital recorders that still had

168
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,910
wiretap recordings on them

169
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,399
I'm you with a on who is this %uh

170
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:41,260
your if you look what my whole apt I'll
follow the stuff for a couple thousand

171
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,149
dollars worth

172
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,500
from expensive wiretapping now I suggest

173
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,890
very strongly you don't try this at home
because

174
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,370
up we it turns out have I got this in SF

175
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,690
a grant from government to study
wiretapping which

176
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,930
turns out to under 18 USC 25-12

177
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:03,920
exempt us from the you know bad felony
aspects of this

178
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,170
so I I suggest you don't do this from

179
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,339
on life you know you've also got an
excuse enumerated in

180
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,920
legal section so we got a bunch of the
surplus wiretap equipment

181
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,439
and we played with it and interestingly
when I'm about to describe

182
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,050
on most ok what we're the
vulnerabilities that we're gonna

183
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,940
described in the talk tonight

184
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,880
were discovered in the first hour and a
half after opening the first

185
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,329
packager equipment that we got pretty
much all of the first things we thought

186
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:33,779
I love

187
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:37,480
turned out to work we never had to get
to testing the second things we thought

188
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,290
of

189
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,319
so I'm gonna turn this over to Micah
whose

190
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,230
going to talk about some with her from
%uh this equipment on the

191
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:51,230
vulnerabilities we found

192
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,510
so

193
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,069
the wiretap that we're that we must do
our work with

194
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,560
is the order type the extender wiretaps
in this is really kind of the

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,310
what you think when you think a
conventional wiretap it's really just

196
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,990
putting

197
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,810
a pair of wires and actually having a
telephone line clinger mind sending that

198
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,290
to a law enforcement agency

199
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,500
so there are two parts to it the first
the extender

200
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,550
states that which the phone

201
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,750
om is a one-way relay

202
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,380
from the subject line the line it's
being targeted

203
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,480
to the law enforcement agency

204
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,910
and at law enforcement agency there's a
separate box again over there were

205
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,689
pictures in this

206
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,910
which is a cardiac flexion ur DNR total
number recorder

207
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,490
which decodes the signals conversion
from analog to digital top what we have

208
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,900
here

209
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,380
and we call the line between the
extender

210
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,700
in the DNR the from the line because
it's on by law enforcement Monforton is

211
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,260
always from

212
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,860
mom so looking to wiretap sees both for
pen register

213
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,410
on systems which are just kind of
capturing matter information

214
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,079
who was telephone number being called
how long it lasted or

215
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,810
and also for full audio intercepts I'm
for can register systems

216
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,970
the audio is Justin so was this looks
like

217
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,080
looks like this is the

218
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,480
extender look like something you don't
want to bring in an airplane it as

219
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,270
I four cables coming out to for

220
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,780
tip and ring ones have to bring them
into the

221
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,480
the subject line and the other going to
the from this

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,280
is the I dialed number recorder which
sits at the law enforcement agency

223
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,500
and receipt is the endpoint if the funny
line

224
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,620
I'm one thing worth morning out here is
that on this

225
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,650
minimize button is used for full audio
intercepts

226
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,819
I this is against Matt mention the forty
under such a bit more expensive in the

227
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,010
reason they're more expensive

228
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,920
is because typically wiretap sir only
given to one

229
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,450
term only set for one person so when the
subject spouse for example those

230
00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:00,160
speaking on the line and you don't have
to hit them minimize button so that

231
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,569
dismisses conversation is recorded from

232
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,070
ins on this is example on in our lab

233
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:11,550
what I law enforcement wiretap post
looks like

234
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,690
when you have a a computer doing the
just

235
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,580
and it was a simple database record in
the stuff the DNR

236
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,760
and also a digital tape recorder for the
forty intercepts

237
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,650
so what we came up with their three
novel countermeasures against these

238
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,010
extender systems no talk a little bit
about clear systems later but for that

239
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,390
most are going to talk about the
extender systems today

240
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,020
the first manipulating capture digits in
here were causing the law enforcement

241
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,100
agency to record

242
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,390
completely false telephone numbers that
were never really dial in fact is

243
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,050
talking numbers

244
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,910
I may not exist the second is interning
false call records

245
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,410
here we can on treatment records because
that didn't really

246
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,810
ever take place on in reduced to some
company techniques

247
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,790
and perhaps the most damning is the
recording suppression

248
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,990
where either the subject the wiretap or
the person

249
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,760
you here she is talking to can at will
to suppress also liked

250
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,240
so in the first kinda measure

251
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,110
the goal here is to manipulate the
captor digits so that law enforcement

252
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,190
agency records

253
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,210
contract of numbers so a typical
telephone

254
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:20,570
has on set 12 DTMF signals

255
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,450
039 houdini Master s in the signals a
really just audio signals that are

256
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,070
composed

257
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,630
from two tones on this atone for each
common for

258
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:33,010
in for each round when the dow something
those two

259
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,050
corresponding to answer Armada checks
online

260
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:40,200
into the telephone company you decode
the teaching of signals to convert it to

261
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,910
its digital

262
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,069
mini-station so the problem here is that

263
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:47,610
the propped open companies switched does

264
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:51,930
the mom teaching of decoding but on that
same hand because

265
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:56,320
on this tough on line is essentially
cloned the DNR's also have to do their

266
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,600
own beauty mask decoding

267
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,710
getting those sounds that you hear when
done number and decoding them

268
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,930
into their into the ditch your
counterparts

269
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,890
so the goal for the law enforcement is
for the DNR box to mimic exactly the

270
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,439
action to the telephones which

271
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,770
as it turns out number which may be
obvious

272
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,850
new to Android devices are exactly the
same so

273
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,070
although they were on exact
specifications that exist in tolerances

274
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:22,450
for

275
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:26,010
how close the frequencies have to be in
the amplitude a twist and so on and so

276
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:26,550
forth

277
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,140
on you can always get because it's in
one device and it's not perfect

278
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,330
you can always get is close to the line
between acceptable not acceptable you

279
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,530
can get our maternity clothes

280
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,890
so supplicant I what we call confusion
digit

281
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,040
by dialing with certain parameters and
by parameters and frequency amplitude

282
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,790
twist

283
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,250
so forth that's just outside the
switches range

284
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,310
so what this means is yes you hear a
tone but it'll be slightly skewed so

285
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,000
that

286
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,230
on the telephone companies which were
completely ignore don't think it's valid

287
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,230
but on the other hand the law
enforcement work for accepted as being

288
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,000
perfectly fine

289
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,110
they can do the exact opposite we call
this invasion did its

290
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,840
where you dialed digits that are just
within the switches range

291
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,230
so the switch will uydess legitimate but

292
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,610
with pretty hi probability

293
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,430
the tap won't hear it at all so if you
can do this than the tapas missus

294
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,460
Tottenham entirely

295
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,840
so how do you do this but you know these
ranges are what turned to call you

296
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,660
really need to get

297
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,780
do is know what the Rangers for the

298
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,920
for the law enforcement wiretap are to
be for the switch

299
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,350
and you need to actually prove the law
enforcement wiretap she can use a laptop

300
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,020
computer

301
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,660
by just on the telephone number and
doing a binary search by just adjusting

302
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,969
these parameters in things like all goes
through

303
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,320
and to test all parameters no numbers
takes about 120 minutes or so

304
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,230
but keep in mind you don't have to do
this every time you want to do confusion

305
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,380
and division digits

306
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,900
this is something you can do one today
before you make your pitches calls

307
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,150
so wiring be computing invasion possible
well

308
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,370
on this is going to graphic presentation
on so you have to

309
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,910
the gray bars indicating was acceptable
wanna talk to the

310
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,240
CEO the centre office into the bottom to
the on

311
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,990
d team of decoder that's running at the
law enforcement agency

312
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,220
meet you can see on because the analog
devices are not perfect image from

313
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,640
community parks

314
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,810
on they don't wanna bug zapper exactly
so there's some area where you can dial

315
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,710
to the right for example which is no
confusion because it's not accepted by

316
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,070
the center of it and it is accepted by
the

317
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,530
I DTMF decoder and likewise for

318
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,420
ovation on the left and again you know
exactly how these things line up they

319
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:41,360
have to try and both ends of the
spectrum

320
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,690
so in our second kinda measure we insert
falls car records that never actually

321
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,280
and I'm have taken place so keep in mind
that

322
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,420
extenders recall audio exactly is how
was inter

323
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,730
exactly as how is and then descended
from the target line to the front nine

324
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,180
completely unchanged

325
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,690
not the front nine between the leave
extender

326
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,820
in the DNR that law enforcement agency
is a standard telephone line is nothing

327
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
really special about it

328
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,680
so you can't relate this DC line status

329
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,700
through the front nine you gonna
disconnect the front line

330
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,720
so on the weather gone for some agents

331
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,420
agencies do this are the manufacturers
have this device do this is day use and

332
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,150
then second

333
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,610
which is always a good idea I'm and on

334
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:27,730
with you convincing thing is they have a
look extender generate

335
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,540
I don't tune I which corresponds to the
team FC tone

336
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,810
no standard telephone has some 12 DTMF
tones but they're actually 16 Skype in

337
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,710
the spec

338
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,550
and these aren't anything special the
mathematical they're just different

339
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,399
tones

340
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,130
on so the seat on his plate whenever on
the subject was

341
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,330
of luck so on

342
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,929
sorry is is on her think on and when you

343
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,090
pick up the phone the seat on terms of
so the

344
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,629
by having this eve the seat own the

345
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:04,630
94 Santino's 12 recording when the phone
is being used

346
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,450
well the seat on is nothing magical is
just a

347
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:12,490
standard telephone town and as an if you
know when you're talking on the phone

348
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,440
and some pics up

349
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,250
another phone housing starts dialing
distance even if it wasn't my first

350
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,630
which is very annoying I'm even you can
hear the sponsors nothing

351
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,610
them did nothing special i dont eat
enough

352
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,850
monotones after the cause been
established so the problem

353
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,110
from law enforcement perspective is that
in our can distinguish the

354
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,310
authentic see tones that are generated
by the extender

355
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,100
from a fixie tune sup my sent by the
subject of the actual I'm

356
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,320
so as long as you're capable of
generating see tone you can screw with

357
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,860
the DNR

358
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,000
so in both cases the dinner to tax out
that the target line has been

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,020
has been not I regardless of whether the
target line hasn't even

360
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,870
so by pressing a few town in again this
can be done either by the

361
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,330
subject to the wire tap where the person
she is talking to other recruiting firm

362
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,629
in just shuts off says okay thank you
very much for your call

363
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,080
marks the end of a next call and when
that happens on

364
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,720
then we stop pressing the seat own it
the recordings

365
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,990
so all you need to do is basically to

366
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,000
in stark enough a call records is 2.0
number

367
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,340
I generous talk on the phone dinner to
seat on for a few seconds

368
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,260
back of the seat on the dial another
number and law enforcement agency will

369
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,150
our record that second number as as the
one with the audio

370
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:37,210
on the third countermeasure is to
disable audio recording entirely

371
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,400
and as I mentioned before nothing gets
recorded wanna see tony is being pressed

372
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,540
because law enforcement agency thinks
the phone isn't being used

373
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,879
so if you just hold down a seat on you
get a law enforcement agency to stop

374
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,490
recording

375
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,910
entirely but the problem with this is
that the seat owners is too loud to talk

376
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:54,890
over

377
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,780
but as it turns out you know read it
need to play the c2 at full volume

378
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,540
all you need to do is played at 1:1000
so there's no volume and the

379
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,860
I launder law enforcement women just
kind of stopped

380
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,500
so this sounds like a mmm rid that
before

381
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,030
here below the speaker system now but
I'm

382
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,330
its yeah

383
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,110
on its despite talking over this I do it
all the time now with all my friends

384
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,720
and it's fine and haven't been arrested
yet

385
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,160
so in again this can be done either by
the subjects other wiretap or the other

386
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,510
party doesn't matter who's generating
the tone because

387
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,520
as long as the tone is generated over
the line

388
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,389
so on there might be some similarities
here after there are some similarities

389
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,640
in the nineteen sixties this was
demonstrated

390
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,440
talked about last session here on there
was this

391
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,990
more ability with the long distance
carriers that occurred when he

392
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,020
you get dial a 2600 for stone and

393
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,720
you could use the exporter race
condition and make

394
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,010
I free long distance telephone calls
well Inc

395
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,560
thirty years later in the nineteen
nineties technology has become much more

396
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,409
complex

397
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,750
and I we have to you tone so we have to
deal with

398
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,120
so if you are capable of producing two
tones

399
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,410
then you can stop or audio recording
insert a call records and a bunch of

400
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,780
other mischievous things

401
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:20,668
and either with 20 hours with a reduced
stock parts

402
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:26,380
were with the slide was always a laptop
computer on this is pretty easy to do

403
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,380
so a.m. previously have been talking

404
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:40,570
what try

405
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:47,570
close

406
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,570
so

407
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,620
previously as this guy before abilities
with

408
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,440
from you'll do extender systems was not
mention the ninety-four

409
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,539
consigned the communications assistance
for Law Enforcement

410
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,999
clear which made it to the standard
between the law

411
00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:13,259
law enforcement agencies in telephone
companies and why this was needed was

412
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:13,809
because

413
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,908
traditional landlines weren't
necessarily always the case

414
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:21,220
we have cell phones and voice over IP
and on there was really need from law

415
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,950
enforcement

416
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,490
deferment justice perspective of getting
a way to standardize

417
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,100
how wiretaps were doing so that law
enforcement agency don't have to have

418
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
twenty different systems

419
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,350
on so with pulley system there is no
conflict under System

420
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,840
written difference there is really just
the dentist the other

421
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,769
gathered directly from the telephone
switching relay to the law enforcement

422
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:43,330
agency

423
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,850
and no didn't use in convincing any
longer because

424
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,320
they separated into two separate
channels the call data channel would

425
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,740
carry the Med information such as
signaling data call times numbers

426
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,019
dialed cetera and also a separate car
content channel

427
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,139
I was just carried live audio and you
can go to the

428
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:04,309
J standard in CJ stander lookup what the
packet formats are

429
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:09,029
the ac/dc looks very much like an RFC so

430
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:12,340
one question is as well are clear
systems trustworthy them because they

431
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,759
don't have the sin-bin signaling

432
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,899
and on first approximation answer may be
yes they are

433
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:20,590
but as it turns out the Department of
Justice specifically requested that they

434
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,389
have C tones unclear

435
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:25,929
call content channels so mom

436
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:29,399
again you know these what the firm's

437
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:32,559
asked for was a way that if there was a
seat on the

438
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,080
recording would just stop just as it was
with

439
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,820
extenders and the FCC said no

440
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:43,820
on you know you can't have that is a
requirement but the vendors who were

441
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,990
the one song equipment I wanted to make
a department just as happy

442
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:50,950
so in many cases and the seat on
functionality does exist

443
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,200
so what are the implications here

444
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,830
well in some systems you can disrupt

445
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,269
interception and here in its cause the
interception to fail

446
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:05,090
in on this is with the seat on recording
suppression but perhaps even worse

447
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:08,509
critically from legal standpoint you can
mislead interceptors

448
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:13,750
you can so concert you can speak because
I can frame someone I can

449
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:17,679
due to mass confusion innovation to
obscure mask my telephone numbers

450
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,500
and also something we can talk about
today but if you look at I double double

451
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,730
double crypto dot com a look at our
paper

452
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,919
we also are able to school incoming
caller ID

453
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:30,639
using the same inventing from abilities
so

454
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:33,639
at this point I'm going to hit it off

455
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:40,639
to hurricane sandy who are going to run
through a demo for system

456
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,360
the first thing we'd like to show you is
with the law enforcement seize

457
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,500
when someone to have a wiretap one is
making a normal call

458
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,539
missus the display

459
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,169
%uh at police had so we've hooked it up
to our

460
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,399
law enforcement here so this is what the

461
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:24,440
guy with the worst job enforcement
sitting there

462
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,649
listening to the reporters sees on

463
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:34,649
just clarify a little

464
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,519
the %uh people here's just a prop as
always you're talking to some

465
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,600
shady person on the street corner up

466
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,639
it has nothing at all to do with the
actual technical aspect

467
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:49,259
so could be any yeah minute of we like

468
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,490
I'll show you with this phone because I
this has the

469
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,710
magical work Witcher standard

470
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:58,830
just explain this play

471
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,990
on the bottom of the log of all of the
past fall while we were setting it up

472
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,889
its Scott in the upper left corner there
you'll see this little

473
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:11,610
greyed out display showing the line that
this is currently looking at

474
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:16,059
sipping that's a notation phone number
are you getting this case 555

475
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,158
by 55 10 free it's currently

476
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:22,549
hope and its own bicep

477
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:27,639
Tony Soprano this is by the way this is
not real data

478
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:31,100
we made up the

479
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,710
and will see that if Tony over here

480
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:38,080
or Alice picks up the phone

481
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,658
feel like if you look in the upper left
corner line status will change

482
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,529
of book and its indicates that it's
recording now they know I'm called my

483
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:48,200
friend bob

484
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,639
we should be getting audio out for the
laptop

485
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:59,889
as well I

486
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:04,889
Alice I'd like to discuss crime

487
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:08,470
but listening one thing about this is
that

488
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,570
if they don't if they do have a a title
three wiretap

489
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:15,610
court they're allowed to listen to the
content can't listen to the content

490
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,779
legal if sorry

491
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,809
that with the campus and the content
legally if

492
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,690
if somebody was not mentioned in the
warrant

493
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:31,009
get on the phone so fun hand the phone
to you you so I

494
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,450
with this law enforcement I have to push
the little red

495
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:38,549
minimize and you'll see if you look in
that offer

496
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,720
upper left corner now it says mean and
that means I

497
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,830
a little minimize button is turned off
the record

498
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,360
no longer recording but still solicitude

499
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:56,360
dust mites

500
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:28,690
a quick lol right now you okay

501
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:47,730
up

502
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:45,710
up

503
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:52,710
recording

504
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,049
yeah

505
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:14,779
basically as far as the law enforcement
agency is concerned because the sea tone

506
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:15,620
is playing at

507
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,049
hung up telephone but they're still

508
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:26,049
talking to each other on a

509
00:31:48,679 --> 00:31:49,280
this red light

510
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:56,280
the tiny red light yeah up

511
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,770
the the red light here is an indicator

512
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:07,360
that the tape recorder back here is
actually recording

513
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,990
so for example if sandy picks up the
phone again are

514
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,700
you see that well it's not gone off now
ton of books the red light should be on

515
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,700
and if I press the minimize button it
goes off

516
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,020
are it blinks if I cross it again its

517
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,190
its listing again and if I good

518
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,700
like briefly before feedback X and you
can hear that the tape recorders

519
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,049
actually recording and playing at

520
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,760
are so now just take our word that when
the red light

521
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,490
is on this the police are recording and
when the red lights off

522
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:42,710
they aren't well demos at this was set
up downstairs later in

523
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,860
demo so this up when we go show the

524
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:52,860
yeah

525
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,080
okay so the next thing would like to
show you

526
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,080
is how you can make a law enforcement
agency think you're dialing any number

527
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,470
so we want to do

528
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:22,720
is confuse the hell so we're not gonna
send

529
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,420
just the standard ten digits we're gonna
send forty some of them are going to be

530
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:28,840
right

531
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,000
and some of them are going to be wrong
using week pro

532
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,380
the central office earlier looking
looking

533
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,800
and found out the parameters central
office

534
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,440
to find parameters for this particular

535
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,440
if you look in the upper right corner

536
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,319
first

537
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:25,869
as you can tell you it is

538
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,590
confuse

539
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,639
gtech

540
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:38,639
me know

541
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,889
so the number where actually dialing is
nine eight seven six five four three two

542
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,330
one

543
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:53,270
know it

544
00:34:53,270 --> 00:35:00,270
your

545
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,520
here places

546
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:15,590
okay

547
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:27,750
the the

548
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,770
so basically pouts what you've seen is
fast

549
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,870
what you've seen is that we have
successfully gone

550
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:53,839
to make a phone call to a number that we
chose

551
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,820
by probing only the central office and
he thinks we called 37

552
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:01,290
373 5011 220

553
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,870
when in fact we called one nine eight
seven six five four three two one out

554
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,560
on earlier what you saw was we were
managing to remotely turn off a law

555
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,180
enforcement

556
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,180
reporter despite playing low-level seato
forty

557
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,370
below its normal level thanks to the
magic automatic gain control

558
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,790
went through just fine and

559
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,830
we can also insert fake records in here
place

560
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,890
a lot of both carried over into the
clear systems because they're

561
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:34,109
backward compatible and spoke compatible
any questions

562
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:41,109
please use the microphones state your
name and Social Security number

563
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:47,000
okay

564
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,670
unused the see time to stop the
recording

565
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,140
and stop playing the sea tana why did
the recording

566
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,450
resume well it because it now thinks its

567
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,700
we didn't stop playing the seato you
stopped hearing besito because

568
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,420
causes the tape recorder I was playing
through the tape recorder

569
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,860
face okay the question is was 30 P or
forty

570
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,120
his first visa 10,000 not a one thousand
reso forty its -40

571
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,680
p.m. and normal levels -10 check the

572
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,859
limits lower sorry have you checked the

573
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,110
tolerance so what we do is to pro you
ask the central office

574
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,530
the central office will happily tell you
whether you're did it is compatible

575
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,550
with its DTMF decoder by either placing
were not placed call dial

576
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,080
with it so we basically binary search
all of the parameters

577
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:42,350
editors fine for amplitude the
frequencies on the upper

578
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:49,350
takes about an hour or so we don't have
a friends house a lot

579
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:54,590
triggering

580
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,950
so we don't we're that's why we're down

581
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,290
40 these digits probabilistically we
know it's going to not accept some

582
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,090
the real ones and except some extraneous
so we're just relying on the fact that

583
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,380
we don't know how it's different

584
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,570
we know that it is unless the tap
peacefully

585
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,640
paranoid how do you know if you're being
tapped well

586
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,100
the nice thing about this isn't you can
still make and receive calls away

587
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:25,480
after no you consider normal I

588
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,480
more seriously how do you how capitals
right us

589
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,000
welcoming this is a totally different
your voice over IP

590
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,110
tap number of different ways this is a
newer technology the

591
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:43,850
you know tapping technology for doing it

592
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:47,509
is just being developed now so in some
sense it's probably less

593
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,280
compatible with the bucks but of course
it's more complicated

594
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,280
their new books so whether or not

595
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,740
analogous on her abilities like this
exist almost certainly

596
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,790
whether or not these particular
vulnerability excess

597
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,480
knows it since you don't know what since
presumably law enforcement doesn't know

598
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,710
where the callers using

599
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,070
was a ride box it would seem tough to do

600
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:13,510
you have any real knowledge well thanks
to get find out

601
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,040
unobserved they they tend to find out
something about their their

602
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,060
targets first they have to know what
phone whose their phone provider

603
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,750
find out so is urs CEO kind of concept
was

604
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,930
there there are service providers and
they can be served with

605
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:33,149
water cities all the traffic said we
presume all the traffic

606
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:37,280
Voice over IP there this depends on sum
up the

607
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,000
some we systems do third here there's
still some

608
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,070
some records office

609
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,820
thanks matter how many

610
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,290
seconds we have left alright

611
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,350
I'm clarification

612
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,740
regarding the evasion science and fusion

613
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:03,200
digits um said you can't know now

614
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,830
is like you no spectrum for the DTM ass

615
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:10,790
you don't know if DNR so

616
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:14,350
how do you know whether you're the
fading digits or

617
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,700
putting extra digits to do not know we
don't

618
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,090
we don't know we just

619
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:24,940
we just send enough its enough

620
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:28,340
its that probabilistically know that
what the

621
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,450
law enforcement agency gets is
completely different picture

622
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,400
said weekend control precisely what
picture

623
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,250
law enforcement agencies getting you can
just be probabilistically

624
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,670
confident that they're getting something

625
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:49,670
that's not at all close to reality if I
could just have to a little bit

626
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,200
on with computing innovation you always
know what you're trying to confusion

627
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,410
or vision because use you've approached
the look the

628
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,440
local switch what you don't really know
is when you do confusion whether or not

629
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,450
it we accept

630
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:04,570
acceptable or not I'm claim same with a
vision

631
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,730
so you by Don forty digits

632
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,150
the the probabilities are in your favor

633
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,380
screwing up the law enforcement agency
machine and you're looking for

634
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:19,540
is just enough that them trying an
exhaustive search all the numbers that

635
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,160
they got

636
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,390
would not give a number because they're
gonna miss some other numbers

637
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,029
so so even if the the found

638
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,440
most of them still missing a few or

639
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,100
my righteousness all up but but for them
have to go through

640
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,300
numbers and punch I love those those
phone numbers

641
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:44,300
trying recreate the call next impossible

642
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,179
a to actually know whether or not you're
confusing with you not also

643
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:53,049
after pro the DNR equipment no we we
don't get to probe the DNR

644
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:57,559
right we only get over central office
right but what happens if the tolerance

645
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,989
is a slight lead to the other side

646
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:02,549
so you know if you you know exactly what

647
00:42:02,549 --> 00:42:06,569
your %ah local central office looks at
right how do you know which

648
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:10,179
how do you know to which side the DNR
taller so if you if you make something

649
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:11,109
slightly

650
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:15,009
more towards the back right and that is
possibly

651
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:19,709
are Asian because you know that your
central offices at this point

652
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:22,919
and are its gonna see that number

653
00:42:22,919 --> 00:42:26,339
but the DNR maybe

654
00:42:26,339 --> 00:42:29,709
closer to the spec sunflower same way

655
00:42:29,709 --> 00:42:33,209
with evasion or without confusion you
are

656
00:42:33,209 --> 00:42:36,459
are but you make it slightly

657
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:39,928
more than what your central office will
accept bomb

658
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:43,819
so basically for any if when you're
trying to evade

659
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:47,939
and I'll with hi but not a hundred
percent probability

660
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:51,749
the central office will accept it but
the law enforcement agency

661
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:55,969
you don't know but it may or may not
with confusion dialing with

662
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:59,419
high but not 100 percent probability

663
00:42:59,419 --> 00:43:02,699
law enforcement agency will accept it
but you know because you broke the

664
00:43:02,699 --> 00:43:03,389
central office

665
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:07,399
so just by mixing the real dialing the
real dick tits

666
00:43:07,399 --> 00:43:11,618
using the confusion technique and
throwing in a bunch of fake

667
00:43:11,619 --> 00:43:14,909
its between what the law enforcement
agency goetz's

668
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:19,019
this totally random picture in the
aggregate jacket for any given day

669
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:21,999
you don't know what's gonna happen with
%uh the confusion digits though should

670
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:23,489
show up on the DNR but not

671
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:27,409
at the telco right so should be possible
to actually send an innocuous number

672
00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:28,269
that looks real

673
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:32,589
that's right I'll def yes um

674
00:43:32,589 --> 00:43:35,769
is the process for tapping cell phones
all summer solar

675
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:40,889
that basically interfaces the cell
towers security you could still papacito

676
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:45,099
over cell phone call and do the exact
same thing when if difficulty equipment

677
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:45,549
is that

678
00:43:45,549 --> 00:43:52,549
backwards compatible stuff with all the
old also

679
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:58,470
I'm

680
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,470
size like a curse I jacket your exercise
just does it

681
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:05,980
end up being an academic exercise is hey
at the exercise is good

682
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:10,120
on women academically gonna have been
caught yet

683
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,200
causation is not grow

684
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,540
for a right arm but is it true that the
law enforcement is gonna obviously see

685
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,810
the signs wonky here

686
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:22,040
and they're going to reconcile via the
timestamps with

687
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,820
the call records the co-host funny you
should ask

688
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,920
on funny you should ask so one of the
things we did

689
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,020
was looked at want it so happens that a
trial

690
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,200
when they introduce law enforcement 147
introduces wiretap evidence

691
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,630
is they bring in an expert because
they're all these funny sounds on it and

692
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:42,120
they're these

693
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,270
confusing looking records they bring in
an expert

694
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:49,850
on from wired explain what's going on
work a

695
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,170
so we spent some time looking trial
transcripts

696
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,760
where wiretap evidence has been
introduce side

697
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,880
the cases paper on it apparently

698
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,620
up fair fairly routinely the wiretap
expert

699
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:07,339
gives testimony long lines yet that
sissy toons

700
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,130
that noise is a seat on just ignored
they pop up every now and then

701
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,270
we don't quite know why it happens on

702
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:18,450
fight it's just seems to be how the
equipment golden flake

703
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,200
so the we go actually no

704
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,690
for school week we do know how law
enforcement

705
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,220
agencies react when confusing things
happen which is just it review them

706
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:36,370
to the phase on the what we don't know
is whether or not we were the first to

707
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,350
discover this

708
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,660
because the when wiretaps

709
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,170
are incomplete or weird they don't seem
to be getting investigate

710
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:48,210
now I came across the paper on Dan
Kaminsky blog it's an excellent paper at

711
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:50,660
the store URL up there think that would
benefit

712
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,420
from check it out thank you a Google
knows

713
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,460
so Google wiretaps on

714
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,220
couple my questions were already
answered by the

715
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,710
call minimize button just seems so

716
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,140
incredibly quaint I mean everybody has
to be

717
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,190
thinking about like casino where

718
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:17,590
you know the the two wives get on the
phone and then after a certain period of

719
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:18,180
time

720
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,589
you know gangsters unique the phone
other hand they start talking i mean

721
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:25,720
are you really saying that still to this
day even

722
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,990
have to take they don't bother to cut
back into the phone call

723
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,310
any point with a two-mile facts and
monitor

724
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:37,490
the thing is that what the what see tone
does

725
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:43,270
effectively is pushes the minimize
button for them yet but I'm just saying

726
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,750
in general you worse

727
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,510
saying like for instance if you know the
two luv you

728
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:51,590
lived in the same house and they wanted
to listen to you but they didn't wanna

729
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,520
listen to her

730
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,780
and so they answered she made a phone
call

731
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,330
when they heard it was her voice and so
they just decide to turn that off

732
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,819
and then after many you took the phone
out of her hands start talking they

733
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,750
would ever there's some

734
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,710
managers they're not sure how often they
bates et in again but it's every minute

735
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,370
and do you have any idea according to
like the

736
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:16,259
stipulation law like how long they can
listen they have that

737
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:19,560
soon as they figure out that it's not
the target parking

738
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:26,560
required stop listening after some
interval there's a doke manual Justice

739
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,200
website

740
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,210
tells the exact avoid numbers

741
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:34,050
I C and justice or to follow up on his
question about cell phone

742
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:38,010
tapping they windup regardless of the

743
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,500
technology employed whether its GSM ur
the

744
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,860
you know CDMA its the same sort of the

745
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:48,450
interference interfaces cell phones one
of the reasons they put the cally

746
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,440
interfaces in

747
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,060
they didn't want to have to do over the
air traffic wanted to be able to go to

748
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,230
phone company just get a standard okay

749
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,780
thanks we have time for like one were I

750
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,070
0 one if I'm after work and I'm

751
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:08,600
PBX you office as one drink

752
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:12,620
my manager eavesdrop my phone call TPD
axes

753
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,779
from seven years ago do they have a
mechanism to allow

754
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,430
her little people to listen in on a PBS
Co

755
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,440
so I know that you know often call
centers of

756
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,570
the site businesses that makers

757
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:32,020
the law enforcement wiretap as is often
the

758
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,460
for that of monitoring normal
run-of-the-mill office PBX is under

759
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:40,740
thanks
