1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,520
yes for a five

2
00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:16,860
okay

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,580
good

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,580
life

5
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:34,619
you're seeing all my secrets here

6
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,030
anyway enough the the sunglasses well so
it strobe lights and

7
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,280
jello by Aphra left a lesser known actor
at the time

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
was the voiceover for what has turned
out to be

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,030
the press %um look at Big Brother today
I'll

10
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,040
and I've always been very surprised to
find myself invited back every year

11
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,300
and on

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,009
Saturday I'll do spying improv and

13
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:10,840
since a lot of your new hopefully
that'll be fun so what I'm gonna do now

14
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,560
is give you a professional briefing and
then I'll answer any questions you have

15
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,020
I apologize for being late

16
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,140
I was in the room and suddenly real
estate and have cufflinks

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,149
but I had a plastic bag

18
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:28,180
cell several efforts later have

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,270
cufflinks anyway

20
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:38,270
its absolutely nuts this briefing is
online actually whack is

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,670
is um is the older version of the
briefing I've change this and I've

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,799
posted to the web

23
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,500
and there's a if you go in press
releases you'll see the the direct link

24
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,560
have updated it and i cant do it with
this lousy Verizon broadband

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,380
so I will do it when I get back on but
this will be posted with the new slights

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,520
arm shortly

27
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,009
these are other references that are
important there are 50 points that

28
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,009
matter to us

29
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:09,549
free open source software hi everyone

30
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:13,269
fine and I i read stahlman spoke I
really respect him as one of the

31
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:14,290
original hackers

32
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,679
surely purple did a great book on on
computers says my second self

33
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,280
astronauts to the edge of the envelope
and I think one of the reasons

34
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,600
in 10 let's we come back is because my
first in

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,579
instinctive sound-bite was hackers or
national resource they're not a threat

36
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,950
like astronauts pushing the edge of the
envelope this society is clueless

37
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,200
and by the way my son is in the audience
and if anyone can identify him by

38
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,860
Saturday I'll give you a price

39
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:44,950
arm I promise you he doesn't look like
this

40
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,540
but open source software open source
intelligence or collective intelligence

41
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,948
open spectrum it's not stupid on
frequency allocation these days

42
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,340
it's not stupid charging politicians for
airtime

43
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,280
on Airways owned by the people so we
gotta move forward there and then

44
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,919
finally open access copyright an open
societies

45
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,310
so these last things here particularly
basic

46
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,680
by things that will help you we are in a
six from

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,139
war of our own making and

48
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:20,669
I'm not going to go into all the details
we don't have a lot of time I am the

49
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:22,209
number one Amazon reviewer

50
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,810
for nonfiction there are plenty of books
documenting

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:30,109
what is either the idiocy love the Bush
administration

52
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,380
or its brilliance and doing everything
in its own interest in against the

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,269
people's interest

54
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:40,040
either way we lose we have lost the
moral high ground

55
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,090
and will and Ariel Durant said in the
lessons of history that morality is a

56
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,359
strategic factor of incalculable

57
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,930
proportions now

58
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:53,510
there are a number of books that are

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,530
vastly sufficient to indict if not
convict but certainly to indict

60
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,180
dick cheney for high crimes and
misdemeanors

61
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,180
he was given the mandate for terrorism
and intelligence on day one of the first

62
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,880
bush term and he blew them off the same
month

63
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,479
the wired magazine had a cover story an
alternative to weigh energy grid

64
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,770
Dick Cheney was meeting secretly with n
Ronan exxon

65
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,448
to discuss what turned out to be false

66
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,750
expectations love the Caspian area
reserves

67
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,889
and false expectations

68
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:42,889
love iraqis opportunities we spent a
half trillion dollars on this war

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:47,220
for a half trillion dollars I could have
given every one of the poor people on

70
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,770
the planet the five billion poor people

71
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,889
a fifty dollar cell phone and change the
planet for ever

72
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,810
so what are the things I do with the
slide in these threats by the way on the

73
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,700
side are threats that have been
identified by the high-level threat

74
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,560
panel at the United Nations

75
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,600
which had lieutenant general doctor
brent scowcroft as the American member

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,120
these are the threats impact on us today
and in the future

77
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,550
and your administration is spending all
of its time and money on threats number

78
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,600
8 and nine and it's not serious about
threats

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,790
8 and nine it simply wants them

80
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,860
as excuses as pretext for war

81
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,510
as Jim Bamford put it in his book and as
pretext for unlimited authority to make

82
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,530
the law and interpret the law

83
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,900
which is not part of the constitutional
private is so the executive

84
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,550
K I'm not sure bush is as much a pop
into some people think

85
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:47,570
but I will absolutely tell you hands
down dick cheney's the guy that needs to

86
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,430
be tarred and feathered

87
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,100
run outta town of

88
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,660
so this puts it in perspective

89
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,410
in grand strategy terms Arcadia

90
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,750
is zip we have lost it

91
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,690
on debt on water

92
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,330
on security on energy on education

93
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:15,630
we are not taking care with all these
other threats

94
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,570
unfortunately in this is a direct quote
you can't fix stupid

95
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,620
but I caution you dick cheney is not
stupid

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,570
dick cheney is an incredibly intelligent
war criminal

97
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,810
he is as good as it gets at pick in the
pocket to the public

98
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,720
and having you sleep through it not you
guys but all the pinheads the don't know

99
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,680
enough to elect benefits

100
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,970
okay which is how America's boating
these days I'm a little upset about that

101
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,120
so this is a brief in a nutshell

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,300
will focus on the sixty billion a year
and I just started picking a fight with

103
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,380
to press releases yesterday

104
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,620
after eighteen years I am this far from
getting a national open source

105
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,050
agency funded at three billion a year

106
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,000
always a tough for her it's a dogfight

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,400
between the CIA which wants the open
source center

108
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,780
have menopausal grandmothers and young
kids and button-down shirts

109
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,600
from fitness to become the open-source
agency

110
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,320
or me I wanted to be a sister agency the
Broadcasting Board of Governors

111
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,820
which manages the voice of american
other public diplomacy that is largely

112
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,420
uninformed by any grasp of reality

113
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,720
which is what the open-source agency
supposed to do so

114
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,950
there will be a bill coming up through
the house that puts the open-source

115
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,469
agency under the Director of National
Intelligence

116
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,600
and there will be a bill coming up from
the senate that says no way Jose

117
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,030
and I don't know if I will win if I win
it's good if I

118
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,460
lose I have to start making money
instead of campaigning for this

119
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,620
we're spending $600 billion a year for
heavy metal military this completely

120
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,139
unsuited to reality

121
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,400
Condi Rice is I am sorry

122
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,669
a blonde bimbo in the skies

123
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,750
okay

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,570
I just keep leave she's a placeholder
for nothing

125
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:15,810
okay the department to stay is building
fortresses that shocked the rest of the

126
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,510
world out

127
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,909
people no longer go to US information
centers because the draconian measures

128
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,440
have security

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,710
make them feel like the criminals they
obviously must be

130
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,780
I have good friends in Scotland Yard
elsewhere and the bottom line is when

131
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,990
you're doing this kinda stuff you don't
wear sunglasses you don't wear armor you

132
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,479
don't run around in massive convoys

133
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,979
you get out there with candy and water
and food and medicine and you become

134
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,289
part of the community

135
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,529
not for rumsfeld what

136
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:50,320
well hearts and minds but but with a
little bit brainpower I will tell you

137
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,019
why I don't have any comment on Donald
Rumsfeld

138
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,139
but I urge you to read my review of one
percent doctrine

139
00:08:56,139 --> 00:09:00,589
in which rom spelled is quoted as saying
any when by CIA as a loss for DOD

140
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:04,620
and former vice president Nelson
Rockefeller is quoted as saying Rumsfeld

141
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,589
was beneath contempt

142
00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,639
now the same book tells you that Dick
Cheney has experimented

143
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,130
ever since president ford with not
informing the president United States

144
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,320
when ordering an action in his name

145
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,410
there is a clear and documented record

146
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,209
of Dick Cheney are surfing the power of
the presidency across multiple

147
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,740
presidencies

148
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,260
now we're not getting him impeached
right now because we got a buncha but

149
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,060
kissing republicans and I'm a moderate
Republican

150
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,540
but these republicans are all trapped in
what's called the party line

151
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,689
read a book by congressman tom coburn
call breach of trust how Washington

152
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,339
turns inside outsiders and insiders
their two kinds a corruption in

153
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:45,970
Washington

154
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,890
one is money in the other is party-line
voting you wanna committee office you

155
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,760
want a nice office with the window you
vote the party line no matter what it

156
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,339
means to your constituents

157
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:59,250
okay then justice FBI is moronic and by
the way eighteen Steelers not me

158
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,170
that's the guy missing one leg that they
tried to arrest me for in Chicago

159
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,520
a while ago arm I was naked at the time
I just come in for must show they

160
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,010
quickly figured out I had both legs

161
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,520
smart guy sees young agents and a
cheerleader

162
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,540
arm national security writ large

163
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,140
this is about the nurture and use of all
sources of power

164
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,390
it's about educated and engaged
citizenry is about carpet intelligence

165
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:30,460
now see eyes done a couple things right
we actually had bin Laden

166
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,490
tracked for four dates rumsfeld

167
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,750
gave Pakistan air corder site first
reported this in the New York right

168
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,930
really likes I

169
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:43,440
on also gave them an airport or us
ostensibly to

170
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,830
remove a few other officers and they
flew up three thousand telephone

171
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:52,700
now if they ask me for someone I had
tell you what told The Wrap

172
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,860
white sheets around their heads will try
not to kill my way a

173
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,950
arm and that will bring back to you so
you have to ask yourself is Russell

174
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,230
still bitter was as part of the plan to
keep okay to live

175
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,470
as a threat that could be built on and
then bin Laden who is a man of enormous

176
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,970
character

177
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,980
chose not to fly out that way he chose
to walk out

178
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,680
and CIA tracked him for four days if you
reach our break on first and

179
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,160
these are books by credible officers I
believe them the pentagon refused to put

180
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,390
up a apatite arrangers

181
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,410
in his path again

182
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,959
are we still pick got lesser is this
part of the plan

183
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,490
morally sound diplomacy is not
ideological fantasyland

184
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,420
general Tony said he was called a
traitor by this white house

185
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,319
for bringing up all the things he has
learned had learned as

186
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,860
commander love Central Command moral
cell capitalism

187
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,529
as opposed to predatory capitalism
balanced offense go here

188
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:52,939
Homeland Security balance budget we are
importing poverty exporting jobs who

189
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,600
loses

190
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
us this is what we know about the world
I

191
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,260
if you don't believe me let me quote
george tenet in a meeting

192
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,610
with all the allied intelligence East
when he said we don't know shit

193
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,740
the law this is what we get

194
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,820
to gets better we don't put it all
together

195
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,350
anywhere there is no place in the US
government where everything we know

196
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,050
comes together

197
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,649
there's not even any place the US
government where we think that secret

198
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,070
comes together

199
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,580
now it's my judgment

200
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,790
as the open source intelligence pioneer
not free

201
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,620
you pay for but not nearly as much as
expensive secret satellites

202
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,370
it's my judgment that in the larger
scheme of things

203
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,029
global sustainable strategy prosperity

204
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,000
bringing up the five billion at the
bottom of the pyramid I absolutely agree

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,620
with CK Prahalad

206
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:55,570
if we only star entrepreneurial spirits
and give them comes devices

207
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,279
the world will never be the same
eighty-six percent

208
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,839
up what we need to know about the world
in order to be an effective nation

209
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,589
is not secret unfortunately a lot of it
is not an English not online and not own

210
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:13,020
any asshole Washington

211
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,520
so we have a disconnect here only they
don't think it's a disconnect because

212
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,189
the white house is fond of saying oh you
must be one of those reality-based

213
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,250
people

214
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,890
we make our own reality with ideological
fantasy is the foundation

215
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,390
okay and looting as the objective

216
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,330
this is my personal estimate where we
stand today

217
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,500
in relation to all of these threats

218
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,020
and policies and that's without
considering the negative implications

219
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,120
for america

220
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,310
of the big dogs on the other side

221
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:52,959
this is your politicians worst nightmare
yes

222
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,310
really really bad

223
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,459
will come back to it

224
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,600
now welcome back to that's what's called
an informed judgment

225
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,990
arm this is reality

226
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,430
your government is spending sixteen
billion dollars a year

227
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,610
ninety-five percent of the cost on what
is arguably at

228
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,980
best 20 percent the value

229
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:24,680
we are spending less than six hundred
million dollars Senate focused terms

230
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,029
with

231
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:28,330
with the for broadcast information
service the new $20 million

232
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,160
dollar-a-year this is Pissin stuff
twenty million dollars a year for the

233
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,350
large-scale internet

234
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,709
exploitation initiative we're talking
here $250 million of focus

235
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,490
open source intelligence dollars this
doesn't count research and all that

236
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:42,490
other generic stuff

237
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:46,980
what's wrong with this picture sixty
billion for the five percent we can

238
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,890
steal

239
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,580
less than $600 million for the
ninety-five percent we really need to

240
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,029
now

241
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:58,540
and changing the rules to the game but
it's hard going wearing your 18

242
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,540
over 25 your dog fight

243
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,750
have a small chance at winning

244
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,279
the intelligence community today to
monitor and predict the outcome of a

245
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,240
baseball game

246
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,149
will use clandestine human intelligence
to bribe one or two love the ball

247
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,420
players out of 22

248
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,740
to either dropped the ball a catch the
ball at any given moment

249
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,220
there agents of influence the signals
intelligence community will put a bug in

250
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,279
the dugout

251
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,550
in trying over here the coach giving
instructions

252
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,760
the imagery intelligence community will
take a picture the ball field every

253
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,140
three days

254
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,010
and try and call the game that way

255
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,680
the measurements and signatures
community will try and sniff the ball

256
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,080
and the direction it's going and when it
doesn't work we'll ask for

257
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,589
ten billion dollars more

258
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:53,839
the open source intelligence community
says go Deutz

259
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,529
catch the ball he's out we pay

260
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,970
it's about harnessing the distributed
intelligence the whole earth

261
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,089
I know you understand this people in
washington are very free to this idea

262
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,250
if they bother to think about it this by
the way is the assistant deputy director

263
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,779
of intelligence

264
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,950
for open source lipstick on the pic

265
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,000
k we have two different views 0 votes
send his view is he wants to be a good

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,700
boy and fit in with the bureaucracy and
has his office perks

267
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,740
unfortunately he has no program
authority

268
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,860
he has no money to spend other than $5
million per year

269
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,700
on miscellaneous and he is not permit
Steph

270
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,410
he's dogged me he is lip service

271
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,430
my view is that we need to create a
robust open source intelligence

272
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,829
community

273
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:46,560
outside the government my second book
the new crafted intelligence is

274
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,910
available at Amazon

275
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,569
and it basically focuses on the obvious

276
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,480
maybe it's obvious to you and me but
it's not obvious to the spice and I've

277
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,700
been a spy and I know all those problems

278
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,250
lessons of history Bush did not
understand

279
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,079
three months into the war in Iraq that
there were sudanese

280
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,019
Shiites and that the majority

281
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,169
like Deron

282
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,510
and in this book I just read the end the
Iraq

283
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,209
Ahmed Chalabi is role cannot be
understated

284
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,720
the man was a masterful manipulator I
believe he was an agent of influence for

285
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,789
Iran

286
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:29,840
I believe that Iran has run circles
around us and I believe actually that

287
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,970
Iran

288
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,669
should be much more respected by the
United States America

289
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:40,399
we tend to confuse nationalism and a
desire for alternative energy

290
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:44,999
with conspiracy theories and communism
and all this other stuff

291
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:48,450
I'm not at all convinced that Iran is a
major threat to the United States of

292
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,529
America but there are a number of
lunatics your new york city

293
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,639
who forget that the CIA

294
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:58,499
ran a cool in Iran against the will of
the people

295
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:01,809
and we're now paying for that as we're
paying for it many other places

296
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:05,730
global coverage there's no one agency no
one country that can see all information

297
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,350
in all languages all the time which is
my third book

298
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,418
and we have to do a burden-sharing think
there are 1400 Middle Eastern experts in

299
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:15,239
the United States America

300
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:18,899
washington talked about fourteen of them

301
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:22,049
1400 14 why

302
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:26,168
well these 14 yr white their in
washington

303
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:31,489
they have clearances they may be worked
in the intelligence community previously

304
00:18:31,489 --> 00:18:36,309
okay believe it or not when a CIA
analyst tries to call people in the

305
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:38,139
country they're responsible for

306
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:41,200
they are investigated by the CIA
security officers

307
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
with high school educations I got
promoted after twenty years a check in

308
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,090
safes at night

309
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:49,629
okay this is seriously poor stuff

310
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:53,119
and then we still need spice in secrecy
for things like transnational criminal

311
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:53,879
gangs

312
00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:57,190
and so forth you can actually eliminate
most fraud waste and abuse was

313
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,340
statistical analysis

314
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,879
okay we i've one fellow that they
discovered $74 million dollars in crop

315
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,179
fraud

316
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:08,669
for four million dollar package love
looking I have two other guys that not

317
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,649
but I don't know I just know them

318
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,509
to other guys found fifty billion
dollars a year in import-export

319
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,799
tax fraud avoidance tax avoidance fraud

320
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,309
this is like the twenty five dollar
rocket engines going to China

321
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:25,720
and three thousand dollar pencils coming
in from China

322
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,720
this is advance money laundering and oh
by the way upon the coffee from columbia

323
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,489
actually weighs between one and a
quarter in one and a half pounds

324
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:38,389
okay so we need to go toward a national

325
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:41,489
intelligence and ever

326
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:46,019
that has shared unclassified information
it has a help desk that shares best

327
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:48,039
practices best prices

328
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,830
it has primary research and experts
on-demand strategic forecasting

329
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,210
so this is it I'm gonna try put this on
my website as a model real soon

330
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,289
virtual library distance learning expert
form I had a bad experience with

331
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:02,019
Wikipedia the other day

332
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:05,749
it turns out that for every 10
intelligent people there are 100 morons

333
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:10,820
like to destroy shit a and so I've kinda
given up on them although I'm gonna go

334
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,168
to Boston and try and learn a little bit
more about it

335
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,779
it's my personal view the everybody
should be allowed to post

336
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:20,649
but only certified master should be
allowed to destroy on and I think that's

337
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:21,480
a good balance

338
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,289
everyone can be heard and then you clean
up the system and you don't have people

339
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,119
do on

340
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,129
collateral damage in there

341
00:20:28,129 --> 00:20:31,590
this is the real military budget large
one

342
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,850
versus the false military budget you're
being completely disease

343
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:41,359
deceived and diseased by your government

344
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,059
doesn't want you to know the saddest
thing in my life and all the airports I

345
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:46,549
go through a single the amputees

346
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:50,450
this government is concealing the tens
of thousands amputees are coming out

347
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,609
iraq

348
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:57,359
and I will tell you that after Gulf War
one we had over 260,000

349
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,899
disabled veterans from the combination
of uranium

350
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:06,669
and chemical brew and so forth the costs
of this war to america

351
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,389
over the long term are estimated at
between two and three

352
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:15,470
trillion dollars and oh by the way we
have 40 trillion dollars a unfunded

353
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,700
future obligations we already know about

354
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,460
my wife causes my gloom and doom speech
arm

355
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:28,330
this is nuts we are spending vastly more
than the next 20 people

356
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,539
next 20 nations on military spending
next to nothing on diplomacy was

357
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:34,869
spending next to nothing on offering ths

358
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:38,619
the Department of Homeland Security is a
massive humongous

359
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:45,619
fucked up failure okay aunque

360
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:52,309
these guys give the combination of poor
Canadia see new meaning

361
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:56,678
okay it is all believable we have a
military heavy metal and we don't have

362
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,059
as Ralph Peters says in his new book

363
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:02,549
never give up the fight we don't have
enough truck drivers

364
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:06,729
we have enough infantry guys and Peter
says we've outsource so much of our

365
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:09,909
military that we've outsourced our honor

366
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:13,639
and I believe that iraq has been a war
profiteering

367
00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:18,210
loot fest and paul Bremer cannot account
for eighteen of the twenty billion

368
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,889
dollars he was given to work with

369
00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:24,999
this is seriously the crap it corruption
on a daily basis that no one's being

370
00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:28,229
held accountable for

371
00:22:28,229 --> 00:22:32,119
we don't have enough humans we don't
have enough state local intelligence we

372
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,709
don't have enough public health and
water tuberculosis

373
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:38,220
is back with a vengeance in the United
States of America

374
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,559
okay this is serious stuff

375
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,940
this is reality these are the ethnic
faultlines

376
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,929
people weep and moan over duh for what
about the other 17 genocides going on

377
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,149
right now today

378
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:56,559
I had the director-general the Red Cross
speak for me back in 94 he says we can't

379
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:57,739
rely on the media

380
00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:02,679
they have the attention span of one
wartime unify see Christine up a poopoo

381
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,239
I'm gonna through my cookies again it
just to make this is

382
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:09,359
CNN is moronic

383
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,178
after 18 genocide campaigns going on
today including one in Russia to in

384
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:13,929
Russia

385
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:18,330
and one in China in russia it's the top
stars and check chance

386
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,529
the next wars gonna be over water this
was a stupid war

387
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:26,190
that should not have been flawed
ostensibly a war over energy it's

388
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,340
actually were overpowered wealth

389
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,070
it's a war between classes I recommend
to the book on the class war

390
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,408
it turns out the American elites have
bought all the elites in the countries

391
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:36,499
they care about

392
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,590
and the elites are essentially selling
out their publics

393
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,678
including the american public and
they're getting away with it because

394
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,799
outside a few

395
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,549
and a few others no one is paying
attention this still hasn't hit

396
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:51,820
Joan chain six pack in their beer budget

397
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,539
okay so we have a ways to go but this is
reality we're runnin outta water

398
00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,970
the mall have decir and India are
dropping a meter every year

399
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,669
two thousand farmers a year committing
suicide in India

400
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,249
overdraw debt in the in the inability I
think that's a pretty high number

401
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:13,909
2000 year K Las Vegas is gonna burp one
day and be outta water and it is going

402
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:16,679
to be a colossal real estate disaster

403
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,559
meanwhile los Angeles is trying to buy
them all have desert aquifer

404
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,259
and the people who live above it helps
figure this out there fighting it

405
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:27,109
but the reality is there are no adults
in this country willing to say hey

406
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:28,449
time-out

407
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,679
we need water desalination plants a
whole bunch of other things

408
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,690
these are the global threats for local
survival

409
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,649
refugees in 32 countries I mean and
complex emergencies that's failed states

410
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:43,970
refugees in the millions across 66
countries starvation

411
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,099
in the millions across 20 33 countries
modern plagues

412
00:24:48,099 --> 00:24:51,158
with india being a particularly passed a
law in place

413
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:54,509
modern plagues in 59 countries and
rising large carrot from the New York

414
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:56,320
Times wrote an excellent book call to

415
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,229
betrayal of trust the global collapse a
public health the soviets have been

416
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:01,960
doing level for antibiotics

417
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,859
throughout the Cold War that translates
in the hookers in eastern europe going

418
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:09,168
to East German businessman going to
Chicago going to american hookers coming

419
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:11,129
soon to a home near you

420
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,309
with penicillin resistant everything

421
00:25:14,309 --> 00:25:19,178
okay your three degrees of separation
from being totally fucked

422
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,910
on

423
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:27,440
and then water and stuff now if you
cross walk the US budget particular the

424
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,430
Pentagon budget

425
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,540
against

426
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,129
the real world threat you figure out
that the pentagon budget $600 billion

427
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,620
dollars is relevant to 10 percent other
threats

428
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,080
now a friend of mine chilmark which and
some other really smart people wrote a

429
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,740
defense Science Board study called

430
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,910
transitions to and from hostilities and
we've recently had a decision signed by

431
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:53,400
the secretary which is called defense
says directive

432
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,490
3,000 .cc and it places

433
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,980
operations other than war including
humanitarian assistance on

434
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,640
equal plane with war operations now this
is a culture shift because as recently

435
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,010
as four years ago the Joint Chiefs of
Staff said real men don't do operations

436
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:09,890
other than war

437
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,140
generals any was not one of those who
believe that

438
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,610
generals any is a pioneer and I hope
that one day he is secretary defence

439
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,580
secretary state

440
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,230
he is a really smart person and he
understands that security in peace or

441
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,150
about relationships at the individual
level

442
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,080
and we have so thoroughly screw that up
over the years it's it's

443
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,280
incomprehensible state versus nation
inter-ethnic tribal

444
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:37,040
gang wars genocide decolonization these
are the threats so what does a president

445
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,250
to a president

446
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,370
exist to do trade-off decisions well

447
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,610
I don't think it's working out that way
there are a number of books including

448
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,580
are price of loyalty that essentially
say that dick cheney close down the

449
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,520
policy process in the US government when
he became vice president he and Don

450
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,350
Rumsfeld

451
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:01,590
cut out all of the bureaucratic people
good people

452
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,450
trapped in a bad system who had
knowledge that was useful

453
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,870
and cheney essentially made decisions on
behalf of the president

454
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,820
with no accountability with a complete
and reckless district fax

455
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,909
for reality and

456
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,660
here a manner that shortly agreed SLE

457
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,490
against the national interest but a
hundred million will buy you a small

458
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,730
navy platformer ground units thousand
diplomats 10,000 Peace Corps volunteers

459
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:33,820
or hundred thousand meters above cubic
meters a decelerating water or one day

460
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,800
war or

461
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:41,620
trade-off decisions I believe one
trillion a year is not being leveraged

462
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:45,980
between interest on the debt a necessary
military systems unnecessary secret

463
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,840
satellites in a wide variety of
subsidies and tax loopholes

464
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,380
I can find the next president five
hundred billion dollars a year

465
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,530
in additional revenue for social safety

466
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:01,370
network programs that as a no bullshit
statement now for lack of good economic

467
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,590
intelligence and counterintelligence and
ethics at the top

468
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:09,250
we are foregoing an additional $500
billion dollars a year

469
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,410
in tax revenue import pricing

470
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,050
insurance fraud lost revenues from band
with unfairly control properties and so

471
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:16,470
forth

472
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,140
were not a money were a rich country

473
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,890
with a very corrupt in impoverished
leadership

474
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,830
and I crucified the democrats who are
just as corrupt but more inept

475
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:35,139
or then the republicans both these
political parties are not serving your

476
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,070
best interests

477
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,260
we've had a policy intelligence

478
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:43,129
York but jello by after isn't the answer
either

479
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:47,910
he can however be Minister of Culture in
my government up

480
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:52,460
you're welcome I heard what you said
about me two years ago

481
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,800
um we've had a massive failure

482
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:59,750
this matters Thomas Jefferson said the
nation's best defense

483
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,790
is an educated citizenry so what we have
here we have an industrial school system

484
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,440
the pizza creativity at a kids for the
time in the fourth grade

485
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:13,440
K we got it we gotta fix that

486
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,270
and and one of the reasons I brought my
son here is because he figured out how

487
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,690
to get six hundred SAT's

488
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,540
and ease without homework while sleeping
or drawing in class

489
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,580
on in this disturbed me but

490
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,510
I'm sympathetic a you guys have helped
me understand that

491
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:36,470
arm now I'm enough go through these at
blinding speed

492
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:41,700
I have reviewed over 750 books 720 books
whatever the numbers at Amazon

493
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,180
and you can go look at my reviews you
can find my master review sheet

494
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,660
you can use my lists two hours in a good
bottle wine you can get a free graduate

495
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,620
education in global reality

496
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,870
okay so I'm just gonna go through this
really quick

497
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:59,330
for the PhD it has to be a bottle of
vodka okay

498
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,679
alright peace operations humanitarian
assistance we're creating

499
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,800
black markets anarchy genocide

500
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,930
resource wars water totally fucked

501
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:14,800
are oceans really bad we're using our
oceans as economic cesspools

502
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,800
thats knots because it turns out the
oceans are more important in the Amazon

503
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,190
up for our future industrialized poison
were based on Corning

504
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,300
up globalized easy excellent book modern
strategy technology is not a substitute

505
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,230
for strategy in time is the one thing
you can't buy

506
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,430
or replace we've just screw this country
over for eight years

507
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,600
in part because al gore didn't have the
balls to listen to grad pabst

508
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,810
go to the mat on the fact that Florida

509
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:47,149
was 35 to 50,000 disenfranchise blacks

510
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:51,970
and that took the election and then Karl
Rove repeated in Ohio

511
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:56,840
in 12 districts in 2004 retail at the
bottom line is the republicans know how

512
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,650
to steal close elections

513
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,800
if the next election isn't a multi-party
landslide

514
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,260
were toast and I'll finish with a few
minutes

515
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,430
brzezinski has some good ideas failure
vampire strategic cultures resistance

516
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:12,110
this is changing over

517
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,890
a complexity most policymakers are
clueless

518
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:19,060
until 9/11 we had congressman and
Senator saying

519
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,040
I don't need a passport because nothing
that happens outside the United States

520
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,580
matters to my constituents

521
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,449
K symbolic friction revolutions in a
technical there about the mind you know

522
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,380
that better than most

523
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,790
the best dollar return on investment is
on education and women overseas

524
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,170
yeah educate the women they stop putting
up with shit from the man the man

525
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:44,350
do less drinking there's more
productivity it is absolutely and

526
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:51,350
indisputable fact that women are the
secret weapon for the future

527
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,040
we need a police force when the united
nations puts together police force every

528
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,690
loser from Nigeria

529
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,750
too well Niger

530
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,980
shows up at these guys can't drive a car
they can read and write

531
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:11,940
okay so it's it's really quite
ridiculous we need Constabulary Force is

532
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,000
these are completely different

533
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
manhunts our intelligence community
cannot find fix and follow an individual

534
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,250
White House does not listen
early-warning army doesn't do mountains

535
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:31,260
Air Force needs 24-hour notice to change
a bomb on an airplane

536
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:37,110
Colo alright holistic strategy you have
to do in our agency holistic study I'll

537
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,070
tell you right now

538
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,580
iraq has a successful it is because our
troops are bleeding on the ground

539
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,330
and giving their blood in their guts to
try and make a success

540
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,090
out of a really shitty situation and I
will tell you that outsider the US

541
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,960
military there is another mother fucking
agency this government is doing your job

542
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,180
the rest to the US government is out to
lunch

543
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:04,340
state isn't doing its job commerce
Treasury aren't doing their job

544
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,330
these people are coming in at 9:30 in
the morning they're taking an hour and a

545
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,750
half lunch breaks are going home at five
o'clock

546
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:13,380
we are not in a state of war we are in a
state of comatose

547
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,230
arm apathetic ignorance

548
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,790
and you guys are letting it happen K

549
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,210
this is the military has been betrayed
by the rest to the government and this

550
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,700
is dick cheney's will

551
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:33,150
he's not really interested in winning in
Iraq

552
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:36,970
never underestimate the enemy I was in
vietnam they had tunnels

553
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,320
going for miles they had a little guy
squat on his heels

554
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,419
listening spoke English to the

555
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:48,430
g3 and then walk okay they have five
thousand sickened people we have loud

556
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:51,950
mouth generals that don't wanna walk to
a secure telephone

557
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:56,720
okay the north vietnamese with little
help from the russians waxed Rs

558
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,760
in terms of listening in including
digging tunnels right up under the

559
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,650
headquarters

560
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:05,380
and having a guy sitting there listening

561
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,620
now this is our home from weakness it's
not pretty

562
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:15,399
one other things bin Laden who by the
way I believe is a very reasoned enemy

563
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:18,750
9/11 was intended to be in a nuclear
vent

564
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,590
in the sensible playing going into
nuclear thing and they pulled back from

565
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,380
that

566
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,480
because they were afraid if it's getting
out of control

567
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,030
that is a measured thoughtful animee

568
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,280
but bin Laden knows he doesn't have to
attack the United States to grab us by

569
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,680
the dole nights and make it hurt

570
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,609
all he has to do is put em bombs in
Nigeria Saudi Arabian Venezuelan drive

571
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,440
the price up while the 200-mile

572
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,210
this is it hard this is the new strategy
we need a logo

573
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:52,040
very fast on this basically we need to
redirect funds in a massive way

574
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,620
toward peace and I had a couple speakers
on the Department apiece in

575
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,910
I've had a wonderful new york contingent
no

576
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,290
come to corrupt the minds my washington
people and it's been fun

577
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:06,460
but the reality is colin powell gave it
up

578
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:09,510
I've always admired colin powell but I
have to tell you i think

579
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:12,840
on call Tom himself to the bush
administration

580
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,780
and he really let us down he shoulda
stood up and said god damnit this is

581
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,390
bullshit I resign and he should have
crucified

582
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:24,529
Bush and Cheney in the first
administration and I'm very sad that he

583
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,810
didn't do that because I had a vision

584
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,290
of colin powell getting a hundred
billion dollars with which to do peace

585
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,700
and there was no finer man on the planet
qualified to do peace and colin powell

586
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,950
and maybe he will come back but I think
he has lost

587
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:42,259
an enormous mantle that he once held

588
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,550
now getting into strategy

589
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,560
the White House is right back where john
kennedy was in the cuban missile crisis:

590
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,580
the president licence the three or four
brothers who are trusted because they

591
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,310
are true blue proven republicans

592
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,450
in Iraq the primary criteria for getting
an appointment to go to Iraq and be part

593
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,569
of the Provisional Government

594
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:06,650
was to be a foolproof Republican not
actually know anything

595
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,490
and six young people and I mean you'll
ended up running the $13 billion dollar

596
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,970
rocky budget and they were comparing
notes

597
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,570
and they figured out the reason they got
a call in been hired sight unseen over

598
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,210
the phone

599
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,940
was because they all posted resumes at
the Heritage Foundation

600
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,440
so for all you looking for a job in the
next two years

601
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,250
go post a resume on the heritage
foundation and you'll be offered a

602
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,350
chance to go screw up some country

603
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:35,640
on we need a director general for
national policy this national security

604
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,040
council is stupid

605
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,200
okay it is so far removed from the
reality is a balancing economics and

606
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,560
security and so forth we need a director
general for national intelligence

607
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,170
who sits on top of a director for
classified intelligence

608
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:54,620
and a director for public intelligence
and I don't have a lot of power I'm just

609
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,480
one man with one paycheck

610
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,790
but I am going to try and make this
open-source agency a litmus test for

611
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,340
congress

612
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,940
fun public intelligence or be balanced
by the public

613
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,080
and I think there is a mood in america
to bounce the incumbents

614
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,860
both Democratic and Republican and I'm
really looking forward to seeing how

615
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,000
that goes

616
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,590
we need a director general for global
strategy

617
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,760
America has no strategy now Dick Cheney
has a strategy

618
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,420
Dick Cheney's a smart man dick cheney

619
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:32,930
really understands what he's doing
however what he may not understand is

620
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,520
that no gated community is going to keep
them safe ten years down the road

621
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,330
he may not quite get that I think you
will see

622
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:44,740
retrospective war criminal indictments

623
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,940
I think you will see retrospective
indictments for example love the

624
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,700
Senators

625
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:55,420
who knew that peak oil was coming in
1975 1979

626
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,910
and decided to cover it up because they
wanted to continue these elections on

627
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,089
low gas prices

628
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,110
and they wanted to keep the money from
exxon coming

629
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,620
I think we need to do retrospective
historical truth and reconciliation

630
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,339
commission is

631
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,450
and I think we need to massively scar
some people in the public eye

632
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,800
in the next five to 10 years in order to
keep the rest of them honest

633
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,620
from now on the public now has a digital
memory

634
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:25,589
this is really important

635
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,260
this is what I would do with the
director-general global strategy the

636
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,960
point I want to make you is that

637
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,460
Washington is is is that is is a a very
badly managed crisis

638
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,160
response organization doesn't do
forward-thinking

639
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,960
it doesn't really work on alliances a
relationship that doesn't look at the

640
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,980
trade-offs

641
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,180
between those 10 threats that the united
nations has so ably identified

642
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,290
you reduce poverty you reduce disease
reduce crime

643
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,000
you increase water availability you
reduce poverty disease crime

644
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,470
okay this is all connected you know this
as well as anyone it's a network system

645
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,060
washington doesn't work on the basis of
networks

646
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,130
it works on the basis of how much cash
has been made

647
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,570
been paid to do Mickey Mouse copyright
legislation

648
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,510
or whatever okay so Washington right now
is owned by corporations not by the

649
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,490
people

650
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:17,350
even if you are elected by the people
the day you get into office you are

651
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,660
bought by your party for the party line

652
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,149
you want that nice of issue nafta vote
the party line or

653
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:28,890
by special interests so we need
government reform in a land with my

654
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,819
proposals

655
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,390
I believe I wish I pray and I realize it
might be

656
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,460
idealistic and unrealistic

657
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:41,540
I would like to see someone like Mark
Warner a Democrat

658
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:46,060
offer susan Collins a Republican from
the northeast the vice presidency

659
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,850
I'd like to see them identify a
coalition cabinet in advance

660
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:53,750
that is ably represented by the Greens
the reforms the libertarians

661
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,990
arm the by afferents are and so forth

662
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,080
of and I want them to

663
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,180
put this out before 2006 I want them to
say

664
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:09,180
these five moderate Republicans are good
republicans who want to keep them

665
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,980
these five democrats are bad democrats
want to get rid of them

666
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:17,370
and we swear to you 2008 is about
electoral reform

667
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:22,350
none of these other issues matter the
democrats cannot beat the republicans in

668
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,370
a doggone dog issue an issue

669
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:27,480
contest they can't do it the only

670
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,800
dog catcher issue in in america today is

671
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,060
electoral reform if you go for left to
reforming you get a multi-party

672
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,240
landslide

673
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,980
did Rothe can't steal the election you
get the people back in power

674
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,090
everything else starts to make sense
cell

675
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,140
these are ralph nader ish reforms

676
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,359
legal women rotors was kicked out of the
presidential debate process the bar

677
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,270
third fourth and fifth parties

678
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,080
from that process okay so we need to get
our priorities straight

679
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,700
first be strong at home attacking iraq
was idiocy

680
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,820
what paul Bremer did with his first two
decisions was the site he knew more

681
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,380
about managing a rock than anybody else

682
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,870
and he basically took over the country
and then he disbanded

683
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,940
hundreds of thousands pissed off guys
with guns

684
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,670
okay against the best advice and don't
get me wrong I think the military is a

685
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,860
bright shining light in our country

686
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,890
against the best advice I've army
generals so strong America through

687
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:24,940
common sense now these for reforms are
all connected

688
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,800
electoral reform Intelligence Reform get
a grip on reality no longer lie to the

689
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,670
public

690
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:33,280
the national security reform start
spending our money in the right ways

691
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,480
and then governance reform and I don't
know where you start but somehow all

692
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,550
these things need to capitalise

693
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:45,310
I've created a small website

694
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,650
as a non rival citizens party it's not
going to go anywhere

695
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:52,650
I mean this country's need several more
Katrina's in

696
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,070
911 before its gonna wake up on

697
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:59,220
but the idea here is we need a non rival
party

698
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,760
with a my Republican weighing a
conservative Democrat weighing all these

699
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,510
other guys and we have to commit
ourselves to one thing

700
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:11,600
to electing individuals who will forego
campaign contributions

701
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,260
and who will four-goal party-line
directives

702
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,390
on how they vote and we need to keep a
close string on

703
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:24,069
and pulling back that website is www dot
citizen staff party .org

704
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,810
it's just a few basic documents it's the
juror move an idea

705
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:32,259
I will speak for sushi anytime anywhere

706
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:39,260
thank you

707
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:43,050
five minutes for questions

708
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,210
on all questions to the Mike please

709
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:50,510
by the way this is the other hackers
organization

710
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,260
Silicon Valley hackers think I'm elected
member out there and it's fun

711
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,890
select cone whatever those guys

712
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,920
hello to your pain on the recent
wholesale surrounds American citizens

713
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:06,500
conchita love well

714
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,250
a couple things about that number one I
think that they they have good

715
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,720
intentions there's there's a difference
between

716
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,120
the president's grotesque deliberate
decision to ignore the Faisal loss

717
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,509
and two into exceed his authority and
the professional intensive NSA to

718
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,380
actually trying to pattern analysis and
get useful stuff

719
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,610
but the other thing you have to remember
is that NSA is still in the 1970s

720
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,750
are eighty to ninety percent eighty
percent of their stuff is offline

721
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,830
you know the all magnetic tapes its not
really easy to do

722
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,840
good stuff here arm at last but not
least SAIC massively screwed up

723
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,110
Trailblazer so NSA has made any progress
in the last four years

724
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:52,440
arm yessir your comment was your comment
I was gates and Buffett fit in on this

725
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,620
that's a very interesting question I
think gates and Buffett are doing what

726
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:59,370
smart rich guys do their hunker down and
stand the hell outta

727
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,450
on now Google .org

728
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:06,950
with Larry brilliant that something else
are Larry brilliant had a really good

729
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:07,490
week

730
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,480
he got the TED Prize for the visionary
and then he got the job as director of

731
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,500
global that or

732
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,690
to spend $1 billion or not more than one
billion one percent

733
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,890
of Google's annual income on doing good
and Larry brilliance number one priority

734
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:21,970
is the global

735
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:27,020
public health intelligence are network
and I've got a letter out to him as any

736
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,950
of you know larry global please tell him
I am NOT a lunatic

737
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:33,830
I would like to help him are because
what we need is a public intelligence

738
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,220
network that no government can support
okay

739
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,250
and has to be in your face yessir you
show

740
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:45,080
let's set up so you don't have to stoop
you're in control here push the thing

741
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:46,660
down over there okay even better

742
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,270
alright you show very useful a nice

743
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,410
charts and figures about how fuck we r I

744
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:56,960
wes is a what is your belief about

745
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,000
using technology in distances social
change to correct some these problems

746
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,610
open technology works

747
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:10,090
technology is not a substitute for
thinking what we have right now is a

748
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:10,950
system

749
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:14,820
that is biased I mean I read I read stop
spoke this morning

750
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,140
arm and it's a good book are

751
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:22,170
and the bottom line here is proprietary
software like he says

752
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:25,860
is software that is biased against
sharing it is software that is biased

753
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,260
against improving in this offer that is
biased against

754
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,660
helping others so I believe in what

755
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:36,180
storminess talking about are I think
technology has a solution but only if

756
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:36,690
it's free

757
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:42,360
in the sense that's all means not free
bike price but free to be shared an

758
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,520
approved and so forth

759
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,620
this is one of the reasons I enjoy
coming here I i mean i get pumped up at

760
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,210
this place

761
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,660

well good place to ask you crazy
questions and

764
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:02,350
on at the risk of being well let me tell
you that in 1992 when I publish t3i

765
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:05,520
ethics ecology evolution and intelligent
so the whole earth review

766
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,950
it was read on the 7th for CIA in Santa
Cruz when the senior woman at sea ice at

767
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:12,440
this confirms stills play some lunatic
fringe

768
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,520
so you're not lunatic you just a little
ahead of the others go ahead

769
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,180

just wanted it

771
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,660
well first on the whole and blonde bimbo
thing you want to watch them a little

772
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,069
bit

773
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:32,170
I mean you want a following in fifty
percent of us the female if you don't

understand the humor with I specifically
don't want your vote

said

776
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:42,510
but I wasn't speaking to the humor of it
I was speaking to the sexism other its

777
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:42,870
house

778
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:46,859
sexist it's very intelligent humor and
I'm sorry if we don't agree on that

779
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,260
point

780
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:50,740
I'm so glad you explained it to me the
other comment I was gonna ask about was

781
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:51,650
the one about

782
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,670

wrong to ask a question you don't agree

788
