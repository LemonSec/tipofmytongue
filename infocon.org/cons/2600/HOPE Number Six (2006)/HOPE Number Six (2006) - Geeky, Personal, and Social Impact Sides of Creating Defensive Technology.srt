1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,480
welcome everyone

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,420
day 30 hope we or standing here

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,610
for social defense technology or rates
is your guide

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,920
the a personal social impacts creating

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,310
defensive technology it's good the usual

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,289
that's quite a few 30 minutes that's the
longest

7
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,479
anyway number 97 which opened number
eighty

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,479
media hi

9
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:43,190
um I'll a data %uh and

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,339
this press play not its early but we're
gonna show some really cool stuff today

11
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:48,879
so

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,208
I think anyone who got up it 9:30 to
come here

13
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:55,519
ily well worth it you can tell people
like oh my god

14
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:59,409
top really hardcore so basically

15
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:03,138
you know introduce ourselves we quickly
missus mittleman

16
00:01:03,139 --> 00:01:06,660
up you know best known for his

17
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,820
da gil is hairdo as well as inventing
the TV B Gone

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,150
you can you got they're sold out like he
just

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,440
you sign that the vendor area and
they're gone like they hotcakes

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,690
he saw me a result about 290 total

21
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,910
our total a hundred thousand yeah so
that's like a hundred thousand people

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,690
out there

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:29,179
turning off TV sets really awesome 25
bucks it's really good deal

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,080
and so that three years ago he's been
doing that for a while

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,760
and you can go to the website and read
more about the project's

26
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,940
I think there's and see press and also

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,470
by them and my name is Marley DA to

28
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,179
and right now I'm R&D fellow at art
gallery

29
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,460
in new york city called IBM where I
basically get paid to do this sort of

30
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,310
stuff which is

31
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,040
tiny and I'm gonna be talking about cell
phone jammers in like how you can build

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,680
around

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,670
other getting like really nitty-gritty
so I'm hopeful you guys have a

34
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,500
a little bit literal injuring background
if not I'll a strike and a girl

35
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,158
slow and be detailed about it because
they release one get all this

36
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:11,439
information out there exits

37
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,858
it's really dangerous but

38
00:02:14,859 --> 00:02:18,409
before um felt so die this is the

39
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,629
slide that just shows you the two
projects so you know

40
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,590
tiny it's just like technology that
turns up other technology

41
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,040
and we both have pretty neat little
logos and then

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,328
you know pictures over about this
scaling oh I have I have this

43
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,489
white cell phone jammer here also I can
show you later the scale a bit how big

44
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:43,010
is that this big but for so I talk about
some research they did a couple years

45
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,569
ago that led me to design cell phone
jammers

46
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,060
and you know I figure like you know will
get really

47
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,950
geeky but first let's talk a little bit
about you know art history of it

48
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,139
um so what's cool about this stuff is
that

49
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,620
Hill these technologies in they're not
like

50
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,079
a toaster oven like this is kinda social
impact of designing technologies

51
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:07,499
that do things like turn of TV's I'm
cover earlier

52
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:13,049
orchard of cell phones and the first and
foremost is culture jamming

53
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,349
setting up the TV is basically like
saying no to mass media

54
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:20,810
and you know them most famous culture
jamming group I have a demonstration

55
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,760
there's from the Billboard Liberation
Front and if you live in a major city

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,189
hopefully you've seen their work

57
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:28,769
great guys gather their hardcore and
like to scale things

58
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:31,349
and so you know they take billboards
like this one is you know I think

59
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:33,019
different Apple campaign he said you
know

60
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:36,239
it's coming up for pretty is the dalai
lama sell computers

61
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,430
like this if you think about it that's
kinda fucked up and so

62
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,219
you know they they hacked the sign
something up for a couple days

63
00:03:43,219 --> 00:03:46,029
so is the you know what they're doing is
they're taking a billboard is used to

64
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:49,209
sell stuff and they're using it to fight
me not to poke back at the company

65
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:52,680
typically an inversion you know he's
taking what they're doing in and turning

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,449
against them

67
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,669
a lotta hacking is about this you're
hiking a website

68
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,889
and you know the packing New York Times
in using that it

69
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:03,109
this mark offer something popular
example or something like that

70
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,620
so he is a really it's a bit a popular
way of

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,680
you know and the girl girls do this a
lot our group do this

72
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,109
and it gets people to know that you're
not alone hello it's me

73
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:18,940
um and so what really started me on this
track the designing some technologies

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,410
was this

75
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,260
on doesn't forces about when I had to
come up with my cases proposal

76
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,599
ulcers good luck for me is the study was
done at the lemelson

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,540
MIT's it's a those nineties a business
group and obviously it was around the

78
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,100
the ass to the 2000 3000 people so I'm
like what

79
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,610
what do you really hate and the slide up
there in so basically people hate cell

80
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,180
phones and televisions more than they
hate ingrown hairs

81
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,290
which is like pretty inspiring

82
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,720
I'll in these not having alarm clock
speed

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,480
it sounded the alarm clock if people
don't like getting up its little

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,110
different my opinion but

85
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,670
people don't like cell phones and TVs
and NY well

86
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,690
what the rise was that what people don't
like it they don't like

87
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,710
being bombarded and the Palm televisions
that

88
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,799
like you can't help believing in a bar
restaurant and

89
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,530
you'd like you can't help but look look
you like to talk somebody in your like

90
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,190
the sport since moving its bright so you
can't stop looking at it's actually

91
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,210
it a brainwave problem like it it's not
your fault it's like

92
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,400
the party your brain that tracks on
gazelles in the Savannah

93
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,370
like that its to the same partners MRI
studies you guys interested I can't give

94
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,350
you the reference

95
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,660
you can't help it you like a gazelle
notes on the thing a baseball

96
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,030
so you that's why TV sup is that you
can't eek asking them they're everywhere

97
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:35,330
and

98
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,530
the put them everywhere and talk about
that for sure and sometimes it's like

99
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,720
it's not that people calling in the cell
phone at that you're on the train

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,860
from Boston to New York ins girls
talking

101
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,040
for two hours about this guy from
MySpace you hooked up with that she's

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,420
like

103
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,060
healing you believe like that on I have
to bother to deny it

104
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,120
look now sick too like everyone else is
going crazy to

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,620
so she deserve it but you know think

106
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,480
it's not like we all TVs and cell phones
just its this appropriate times for it

107
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:03,850
and

108
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:08,050
we just wanna bring that control back to
us

109
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,080
so it doesn't knows examples of me using
in

110
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,430
this is awesome cartoon um it's
basically a you make a comic

111
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:19,670
you're saying I'm tired of technologies

112
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,970
like intruding upon me

113
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,200
and it's also like really awesome to
like just

114
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,100
you like team like mute switch

115
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,710
power so you think the people who do
computer hacking is

116
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,900
source familiar I mean was a TV gone
well it's actually if you think about it

117
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,240
see

118
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,880
little universal remote in a little box
just really small had only the off

119
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,780
button

120
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,560
its gonna spoofing like your your you're
fooling the TV into thinking that it's a

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,670
real remote

122
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,590
and also show more technically later a
cell phone jammers really just a denial

123
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,560
of service attack you just flooding

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,620
like the bandwidth with no eyes and it
just took the cell phones can keep up

125
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,710
its this

126
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,370
not sorry im done and if you you know
you wanna like really get more in depth

127
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,900
to the stuff there's actually a whole

128
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,460
group of artists to do work with
technologies that

129
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,700
are kind of well third know are there
something kinda like

130
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,430
scary and weird and strange about them
in like this is like

131
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,470
quote that from the Arabian Tony done
and they were

132
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,620
really good book about this so read
about it and

133
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,920
it's all about like making technologies
are you know they're

134
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,710
fucked up there technologies that fight
back the technology to defend you you

135
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,680
know

136
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,880
that just like cell phone jammers things
like um

137
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,780
CD's that are filled with like traffic
sound so that when

138
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,830
people call you up and you want to
pretend like you're in traffic and not

139
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,460
sleeping and you can be like

140
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:46,710
you found the CD in your on the phone
you like I'm so sorry com com I'm in

141
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,790
traffic on how the trying to get their
stuff as I can but

142
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:54,010
you know I don't know like 93 is backed
up and then you can go back to sleep

143
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,990
sitting on that really help you not like
a test drive it doesn't really help you

144
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,730
really have to get to your day so great
example that I like to show is

145
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,980
um so as an art project done

146
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,860
actually at the MIT Media Lab um called
the No Contact jacket

147
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,300
and this is a efficacy on

148
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,770
it to the protectors really good but
there's this purple high voltage

149
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,810
our King happening on her left shoulder

150
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:25,230
and as you can see it but I am you go to
the website no contact dot com

151
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,290
and this jack is this is a switch on it
and if you're female

152
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,930
and sometimes you walk around late at
night so scary neighborhoods in your

153
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,550
there were about guys like grabbing you
on now

154
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:40,630
is a commentary about how its it's scary
sometimes to walk around alone at nine

155
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,820
and I get scared so you have this 5,000
5

156
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,550
5,000 vol jacket is so it's lover on the
inside and then

157
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,250
there's this get A's are sewn into it
with wires that go through its

158
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,130
conductive

159
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,250
as a one grabs you this video I love it
on the website the

160
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,310
it just E it's advantageous assist
interesting is just

161
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,960
it's not that this is sold you can't buy
this puts commentary about

162
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,270
fear and armor and clothing and how we
protect ourselves

163
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,480
so now I'm gonna pass that like of two
matches to talk about

164
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,300
and hearing on all sorts of cool stuff
you can do that yeah and then all

165
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,950
go back to lady at a about how do build
cell phone jammer

166
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:27,000
so as you know I invented TV B Gone
which is a remote control

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,720
that turns up tells slow

168
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,840
local we should all play our part in
undoing

169
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,040
mind so %uh TV gone has one button
because in my opinion and

170
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,930
clearly some other people %uh TV only
has one button which is useful and

171
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,290
that's the off button

172
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,339
so you know I'd normally when I give a
presentation I've given

173
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,570
zillions now arm I go through all this
stuff about media but

174
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,220
you guys are too sophisticated to go
through all that but I do and I just %uh

175
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,660
China

176
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,839
a few things quickly so TV exists

177
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,250
for one thing and one thing only can you
guess what it is

178
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,350
yeah I heard some people say it's a
those are

179
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,230
a the main thing is it to make money for
the TV stations

180
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,089
and they do all sorts of things to do
that and there's nothing wrong

181
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:22,279
with making money in and of itself but
when the purposes only to make money

182
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:25,020
there are consequences for its not for

183
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,150
my well-being for your well-being its to
make money

184
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,900
so one other things they do is just to
get you to sit there

185
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,020
and the worst thing about TV in my
opinion is that

186
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:40,110
time goes away and time is one of the
few things

187
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,690
that is really really valuable

188
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,360
cuz once it goes way it's gone you know
were born

189
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
some point weed I would we do without
time in between

190
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,060
and we can choose to watch TV you know
if it's a choice but if

191
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,610
you just sit there you watch some mmm

192
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,410
let's see what's on no that wasn't good
lets you with on next

193
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,490
team that wasn't good but see what's on
next okay

194
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,690
three hours go by I'm next TV addict

195
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,410
hi my name is Mitch I mean X TV addict
um

196
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,640
I A arm have been through this and maybe
some love you have to

197
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,230
so but there are other things about TV
as well um

198
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:22,320
and I don't know

199
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
if I really wanna go through all of this
but a I want the people that helped

200
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,450
develop

201
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:31,360
are virtual-reality back in the day it
was called ET's

202
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,089
weird time and arm one of the things
that

203
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:38,360
we discovered is that love brains

204
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,440
human brains take very very very little

205
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,970
to call something real all you have to
do is show something repeated a few

206
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,029
times your brain goes up

207
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:50,830
that's real arm my intellect can be
telling me

208
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:54,020
I'm sitting in a chair in Redwood City
Calif

209
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,520
in office building but everything else
in my being is saying I am floating

210
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,870
through space looking at clouds and
purple pigeons floating by

211
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,070
and there's a folk singer singing a bad
folks on

212
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,430
arm that was one of our virtual-reality
world's

213
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,640
an arm you know it that's real so

214
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,500
from TV makes use love this a great deal

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,770
you just put something on their repeated
a few times and it's real

216
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,800
and its putting out there a

217
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,270
when you watch the news scary shit scary
shit

218
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,160
scary shit and the world's art seems
like it's

219
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,959
know kinda scary place out there and it
is this week

220
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,649
a little bit but there yeah not here

221
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,029
I get back or something happy Starbucks

222
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,790
you know about it yeah it's really a
room go back to sleep so I'm

223
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,199
um anyways you know the world is
actually

224
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,940
an amazing place it's scary and it's
wonderful and it's weird and its kinda

225
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,210
all these things in between but

226
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,220
TV just kinda repeat certain messages so
um

227
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,680
anyways a which is one other thing I
wanted to try it is personal experience

228
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,380
as a little kid I was really very very
unhappy and

229
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,720
actually really depressed and now you
know

230
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,950
maybe some you can lead to the STU I'm a
geek can I was beaten up for being a

231
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,399
geek

232
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,410
being weird being you know being gay you
know

233
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,689
can pass and arm and when I come home my
parents didn't really understand so I

234
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,720
just for treating watch TV

235
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,589
and by doing that I didn't really learn
how to deal with people I was just like

236
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:28,779
more and more introverted as time goes
by and arm

237
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,010
and so people would become even more not
come home to sry

238
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,810
retreat in the TV even more so from

239
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:39,430
I'd watch TV in a at I'd even be
thinking as a little kid

240
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,660
known this ligands island episode is
really stupid

241
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,069
I don't like it why am I watching it but
a

242
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,240
I don't really think about it much
further than that and I kept watching it

243
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,560
so from I have this

244
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,100
the thing about TV at this point to is
actually around 1980 nothing really

245
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,380
happened to something clicked

246
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,310
means like in hot I don't have to watch
this shit and %uh since then I've been

247
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,160
able to

248
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,680
have a lot more time a lot more energy
and my outlook on the world

249
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,200
certainly is improved I would not have
had time

250
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,680
to build this if i watch TV so

251
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,690
one thing um the hope God even touched
on this so

252
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,279
quite powerfully I think they said you
know in that in the conference

253
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:27,670
there are so many cool things to do here
there's no way you're going to be able

254
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,089
to do it all

255
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,360
there's no way so just go in there and
do what you can and

256
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,070
really thats that's life there's way too
many cool things to do on our world

257
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,550
in our lives why waste any moment over
doing something you don't

258
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,310
really really enjoy doing you know
there's just way too many cool things

259
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:50,390
so Gagne

260
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,770
so this is visit the problem that I've
been saying for a long time TV's

261
00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,270
are popping up everywhere we can trust
arise

262
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,329
often enough %uh without being marketed
to their popping up all over in public

263
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,300
places you know it's

264
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,350
if you choose to watch it home whatever
but in a public place

265
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,600
we don't have the choice is being there
we don't have a choice in the program we

266
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,740
don't have the choice was being

267
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,820
on or of

268
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,910
so

269
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,689
okay so um

270
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,200
so that that brings me to love being an
inventor

271
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,280
II didn't really have the courage to
call myself an inventor and till

272
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,970
I started really working on TV on but
I've been an inventor all my life

273
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,340
and down the inventing as I see it has

274
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,520
these these three steps so there's a
problem

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,470
and the problem is TVs in public places

276
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,650
and I came up with an idea to solve this
problem

277
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,709
I was sitting in a and a restaurant with
some friends I hadn't seen in many years

278
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:00,060
are and we pick the restaurant was kinda
centralized in the huge

279
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,630
Bay Area and it happened to have a TV on
the corner

280
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:06,960
and we were talking to each other who
kept getting distracted by this

281
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,580
thing that demanded our attention

282
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,890
and we couldn't help ourselves I
couldn't help myself

283
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,949
going to start talking about it as well
Scooby Doo

284
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,030
and now would it be cool if you just
turn off things like that anywhere we go

285
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,510
of course I realize I could cuz I'm a
geek and now we've unnamed it right then

286
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,140
and there

287
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,020
%uh that was actually thirteen years ago

288
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:34,230
and given the nature of life and working
in electronics last thing I do is come

289
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,100
home and play in electronics but F

290
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,690
after about 10 years in telling all my
friends and I'm telling all their

291
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,500
friends and I'm telling all their
friends

292
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,820
arm you have to build this thing I
really need one

293
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,370
and so I finally did it start about
three years old took about a year of my

294
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:49,920
life

295
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,250
conceptually it's just so easy you know
a little microcontroller

296
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,520
timing pulsing infrared light just
turning

297
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,900
sending out the of codes but it took me
a year

298
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,300
to get these codes together um

299
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,399
and Dom me go into that a little bit

300
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,400
but to implementation nom is TV gone
missing I

301
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,709
here's the schematic for it %ah yeah

302
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:20,959
up can't really see it maybe go to the
next one is

303
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,020
a picture of it aidid in there

304
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,240
arm I don't know how many people are
going to go through

305
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,910
like more geeky like how this works I'll
do it

306
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,810
every time okay so um it's like I'll
just do it kinda quickly

307
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:42,389
um over idea

308
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,110
so I'll sorry about that arm

309
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,540
the Michael controller is really the
heart this is

310
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,070
as you can see really simple there
aren't many parts its it's mostly just

311
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:58,520
microcontroller that has some timers
that make pulsing infrared light

312
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,910
I love very simple this is a chip that's
designed

313
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,010
specifically for infrared remote
controllers so it has a a few

314
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,030
instructions

315
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:11,620
is made by dialogue arm the old-timers
right might remember is the

316
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,850
eighty when the early microcontrollers
this is

317
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,520
a arm us beefed up version of that
that's very small

318
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,650
and it has expanded instruction set and
it has timers is built into it to make

319
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,490
gum

320
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,130
remote control timing simple and so I
have my firmware

321
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:34,300
and a database love all the codes it
took me a year to compile

322
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,040
and where I got the codes was taking
universal remote controls

323
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,460
and I built a system to

324
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,170
acquire the data from them I started a
company and a silly Valley

325
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,230
Silicon Valley I mean and I am it

326
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,370
made RAID controllers which is some that
just makes describes

327
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,470
look the call to a computer and I wrote
the firmware for and I had a bunch a

328
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,460
prototype so I did I could have bought

329
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,520
a-arm a digital scope

330
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,180
or some kind have up professional data
acquisition system but those were like

331
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,730
ten thousand dollars

332
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,620
for years ago a but I have these
prototypes lying right just hacked into

333
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,380
that and wrote

334
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,840
the from where since tight control over
it arm

335
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,740
for this so freeware RAID controller and
it turned into a

336
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,680
TV B Gone data acquisition system and it
works really well I'd

337
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,420
it's tedious though I yeah I'd put punch
in the first code for my universal

338
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,340
remote control

339
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,350
started my software press power

340
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,320
and repeat that out about fifty thousand
times over the period of the year

341
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,399
and analyze the data and if anyone's
interested

342
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,210
corner me later I can go through that
process but

343
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,280
so so anyways that turned into a
database for TV be gone

344
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,399
and when you press the button which is
the

345
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,000
but on left yeah

346
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,860
and numb the microcontroller sees that

347
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,210
and it just sequences through olive the
of codes

348
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,530
one of the things I had the do is a

349
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:13,129
with that

350
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,770
yes it really needs a crystal because a
um

351
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,700
the timing has to be plus or minus maybe
five percent

352
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,870
when you send out an infrared does set
of pulses the

353
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,360
TV receiver receives that if it's not
time properly the TVs going to ignore it

354
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
so I use actually a ceramic resonator
which is cheaper

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,340
and so one other thing I experimented
with his the time between each code I

356
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:39,699
made

357
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,520
short as possible because there's so
many coz there's there's thousands and

358
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,889
thousands and thousands of brands of TVs

359
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,400
and I narrow it down to a hundred
seventeen codes which will turn off like

360
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,460
ninety nine percent of them

361
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:54,510
and a

362
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,690
that was part of that year long arm

363
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,240
chunk of my life so that we could turn
off keys in public places

364
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,950
and I love

365
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,390
what else can I say a the power supply

366
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,530
is something I worked a lot on to

367
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,440
and a according to the math anyways

368
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,200
I want to have six bolts go through the
infrared emitter

369
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,740
which is a a over here and

370
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,860
a really pump it out so we could get TV
across a crowded room in off in the

371
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,440
corner

372
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,320
a and sit on to aim at it too well and I
want to use a a new friend a mentor

373
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,389
that would have a wide beam but not so
wide that it disperses all the energy

374
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,220
and it can't be too far

375
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,550
these are some kind engineering
trade-offs arm

376
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,590
but it turns out that's 83 vol

377
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,169
fatter battery works better and in my
next version

378
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,770
TV gonadal have that but if you have to
be gone in the battery runs out

379
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:55,250
used to fat batteries rather than too
thin batteries

380
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,240
and a February and that's on my website

381
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,050
Uganda com things boy

382
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,159
about that that did I miss anything

383
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,260
yet question yeah

384
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:17,260
our our PP question

385
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,090
all the different brands how to come up
with a 117 codes

386
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,330
a lot of field testing this is what Best
Buy is really great for

387
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,360
so

388
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,250
%uh Best Buy is actually particularly
good because they set it up so that

389
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,440
as you walk in your confronted with a
wall of TV's

390
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,620
and so it's a just a wreck shot you know

391
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,040
they'll turn off its kinda miss have a
little video in here

392
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,350
I'll show momentarily um a

393
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,860
I have I'm not a actually been Best Buy
another reason it's really good is

394
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,670
because

395
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:57,450
a people there got paid minimum wage in
they just don't care

396
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,890
and they leave me alone other places I
would go and I talked to the manager and

397
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,290
i'd have to tell 'em in a

398
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,040
third the router a/v geeks from high
school just like me so they can

399
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
understand but they

400
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,510
it's like no dude you gonna save to
program it in order to turn off the TV

401
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,370
is at 9 I'm inventing that's why I'm
asking about this

402
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,720
to do the one where can a and I just
point the TV turns off his

403
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,440
and a many crazy calls all the other
people over

404
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,700
needs this guy made this thing and so
any that's cool but best buys the best

405
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,720
because I'm

406
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,020
they have ceilings TVs and they just
don't care arm

407
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:36,030
so once I A R got it all together

408
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:40,410
I knew I want to make one for me um but
since I told my friends and they told

409
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,540
their friends and they told their
friends it's like

410
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,600
I should make a lot of these things and
of

411
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,700
I just at that time three where the
company started back in Simi Valley

412
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,870
%uh they sold the company for some

413
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:56,900
ungodly amount and now is deluded downed
a

414
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,580
almost nothing but I had a a they sold
it for 150 million dollars almost

415
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,230
nothing

416
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:05,870
percentage under 50 min a million
dollars was enough to buy twenty

417
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,280
thousand cubans

418
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,520
so perfect timing I made twenty thousand
cubans

419
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,550
and I figured this is an opportunity to
get

420
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,580
a message out there which is you know my
subversive mind at work I have an agenda

421
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,820
I'll during a TV on or off is a choice

422
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,929
not only in public places but at home
I'm a big fan of conscious choice

423
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,610
and I'd like to give other people
opportunity to think about it he

424
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:33,240
no make a conscious choice for
themselves so

425
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,500
yeah levy hopefully the AV will work no

426
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:46,500
sound the sound on the video sorry the
sound is important just is working

427
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,030
it

428
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,040
absolutely is you notice it before and
so after no cellular

429
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,110
oh yeah

430
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,250
coughing and I said

431
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,570
the president said

432
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:15,570
period I sit together

433
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,110
health okay like

434
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:25,230
no evidence right that was an experience
that someone using TV or in this

435
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,700
TV B Gone in public for the first time a
positive experience

436
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,480
yeah so a one of the reasons I knew that
this was a hit

437
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,660
besides for %uh the first day of sales
on where dot com

438
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,790
um determine the first day of sales and

439
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,020
I had to get the website going with my
friend Chris Hughes

440
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,870
in the audience clear up all night and
we had to get it up before a wire dot

441
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,500
com article was gonna be published
online: is like I am we need some

442
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,560
padding on Tuesday we'll put it up there
and I figured out

443
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,399
who where dot com has ever to wear dot
com but maybe a few people come by my

444
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,030
website

445
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:05,399
so at 5% inode in the morning we finish
and

446
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,260
the email indicator goes dean saying

447
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:12,590
you can order something going wrong and

448
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,690
being Dean being it's like what is going
on here so I guess people do pay

449
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,330
attention to where dot com

450
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,480
including all things considered I NPR

451
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,730
and at nine in the morning after no
sleep for

452
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,870
who knows how long I have to do an
interview

453
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:34,320
live for national radio and I guess I
did okay because

454
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,840
the AP called a few minutes later and
the New York Times

455
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,290
and then damn rather people fucking
magazine

456
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:46,360
the next day box calls

457
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,380
box it's like this is one thing they
like they like to hear about themselves

458
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,370
a sort of like it's like well-run

459
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,670
that engine still get attention from the
media Gaia the meat is very narcissistic

460
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,900
him the opportunity to talk about
themselves they have the perfect

461
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,920
opportunity here

462
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:05,080
arm what I found though is that people
who work for TV who make TV

463
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,270
um love TV gone they come home

464
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,330
the last thing you want to do is turn on
a TV they don't have enough time

465
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,970
they do something they enjoy um making
it not watching it

466
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,510
so %uh but one of the reasons I knew
that the I was

467
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,680
really doing something cool was that
people started

468
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,740
hacking my hack so

469
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,910
a if you go on Google there's like
sometimes up to a million hits for this

470
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:30,490
thing

471
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,300
a two years ago there were four those
were my four different domain names

472
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,350
a so %uh some

473
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,770
a someone Nov put it inside have a cell
phone

474
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,010
so they could be more stealth about it
ok got it cell phone

475
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,900
a French fan I'll have a lot of fans I
mean

476
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,100
it's it's weird to have fans its kinda
nice weird um

477
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,450
he put it inside a McDouble while
package I don't you can see from the

478
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,880
picture but there's a little hole in the
old arm

479
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,910
even went so far as to cut off the
filters above the cigarettes

480
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,100
but the TV be gone in there and put the
filters in I don't know

481
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,110
what'll happen someone so cigarette but
saddam

482
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,480
Engadget from some weirdo in the
audience did that one

483
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,490
and a a he put it um a

484
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,950
in binoculars to make it go very long
distance

485
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:27,350
a some other weirdo in the audience

486
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,440
who works for me magazine had some folks
there

487
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,800
put it in a half so then there's this
one

488
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,360
here that's high-powered us jure

489
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,370
love infrared emitters with the big
battery %uh

490
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,680
the hats kinda cool because it's just
always on and

491
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:51,990
in for the meters are in the visor and
wherever you look TV's turn off

492
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,550
and

493
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,909
lady at a did a really cool a project
for her thesis which is classes that you

494
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,360
can see through normally

495
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,890
but if you look at TV go black Sparta
therapy system for people who are

496
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,100
addicted to television

497
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:13,470
keep so it's like anyone might adviser
has it

498
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,510
like it was are the deal like you get a
thesis I keep the project

499
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,090
of but it's such a cool concept

500
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:27,030
yet the selected 20 12 the free bike for
the 12 IRA 10 the nine volt like

501
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,889
we went to the bar and not just to elect
it's like the sector she missed the

502
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,650
nuclear option for TV B Gone

503
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,890
26 sick it's a all black like oh my god
is it gets intense look at the it's like

504
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,350
everything goes up nice you know I gotta
go point now

505
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,480
Solomons but it would make you want to
look at the T

506
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,600
yeah I know it works really well ago i
dont like you anymore so high

507
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,310
there's

508
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,159
my

509
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:04,160
yeah

510
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:12,800
by

511
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,780
fun for the whole family yeah

512
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,510
i've a lot the passive aggressive family
I

513
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:30,049
believes they interact yet so my family
didn't but

514
00:30:30,049 --> 00:30:34,750
so yet so this this project was
definitely the word go to a lot of

515
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,470
friends you know I had the idea

516
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,510
but I a lot of friends who helped with
this

517
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:43,549
now the Chris who help with the website
but friends who helped with

518
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:47,379
a industrial designer help with the the
weird little

519
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:52,520
that many like design and my friend you
know did graphics and a

520
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,510
different friends who did that video um
so

521
00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:00,980
its it's a just getting people together
we're all doing what we love

522
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,799
and when would you do what you love and
put it out in the world

523
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,620
a lot of energy from you know that we
had goes with it and other people pick

524
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,650
up on it and if it's a cool idea

525
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:14,900
%uh every week and make an impact and

526
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,980
one of things that's really just I've to
I'm just amazed with we all have a lot

527
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,669
more power then we believe we have you
know it's just

528
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:28,020
me one guy you know I'm somewhat
intelligent creative but

529
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:31,418
I'm numb different than any you guys and

530
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:35,020
no look what happened at just from an
idea

531
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,799
and Dom you can make your sociopathic
dreams come true

532
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,470
it's true

533
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,580
you know if I can go I'm youth okay
we're all prove really

534
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,260
and up you know it if I can go from
being a totally depressed blob is a kid

535
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,049
to being someone who does what they love
i mean I make enough money to live off

536
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:56,639
this

537
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,590
and so are all my friends were helping
you know we we did this not for money

538
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,059
but

539
00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:04,928
it turned out to make with so the
hundred thousand these things and now

540
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:09,049
um you know so I can pay my friends for
all the time now

541
00:32:09,049 --> 00:32:12,059
um you know if I can go through all that

542
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,620
do what I love and be happy you know
anyone can

543
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:19,919
seriously so from that's the

544
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,090
pretty much to keep you on store doesn't
by leading questions later

545
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:26,190
afterwards and I'll alguna even come
often

546
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,220
and play with the cell phone stuff TV
Ghana hacks

547
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:32,950
cell you know I'm gonna talk about cell
phone jamming

548
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,380
my God look a jerk would call

549
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,049
right column middle of my top

550
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,049
good so your home on

551
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:46,299
%uh missed call

552
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,440
home and on our cell %uh you know

553
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,970
why would you wanna cell phone jammer
well it's only appropriate law

554
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,880
situations not all situations

555
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,409
a lot of people say like oh what if
there's a doctor on call it is an

556
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,500
emergency in Psych

557
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:01,780
welcoming you know you can be careful
about this there's

558
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,510
definitely times anyways are preface
this by like please don't feel really

559
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,080
stupid with this technology

560
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,500
like you can even like there's no this
you can make this into a one watt

561
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,470
transmitter that takes a whole block but

562
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:15,730
it is a legal SEC regulation 15

563
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,799
dot 3 cm is a leak makes illegal to like
own use operates L

564
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,950
et cetera a cell phone jammer it's
actually not illegal to talk about them

565
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,360
what to tell you how to build one

566
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,230
so right and we're not proposing that
any sorry law I don't think I'll be led

567
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,440
away in handcuffs

568
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,650
in the next few minutes but that's an
interesting so

569
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,059
on basically you know I'm gonna go
through life technical stuff

570
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,280
with the cell phone jammer just like
they did to the social theory stuff

571
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,809
already

572
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:46,610
it's really simple any cell phone dino
people had dual that a try then phoned

573
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,169
you know that

574
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:50,340
there's basically three then what's that

575
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,809
cell phone talks on RF it's a 800 to 900

576
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:59,470
approximately which is death lower bands
GSM and then there's

577
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,840
um 1800 to 1900 1.2 1.9 gigahertz which
is

578
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:08,300
I think that's also GSM and then there's
like 1.92

579
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,339
to get her to suck I mean of my little
bit taken

580
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:14,609
look this up in the FCC but those are
basically the two bands you wanna grab

581
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:15,020
and then

582
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,810
I'm you recently unnecessary get into
wifi jamming like

583
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,350
at first I said why would you wanna wifi
jam but like if you've ever gone to the

584
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,969
Apple store the wifi jammer it's really
fun

585
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:29,149
I'll a guy like they got a cafe legacy
in the salon a sense because

586
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:32,799
you know for example if you live in San
Francisco you know that

587
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,109
no Google and in the mare like
interested in making the whole place

588
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:39,659
like wifi level and that sounds really
ideal guy can check what you know

589
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:40,530
everywhere but

590
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,139
you want to go to Cafe useful like have
a coffee and hang out with friends and

591
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:47,740
not be surrounded by bloggers like
people write novels and they sit there

592
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,139
and they don't buy anything and

593
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:52,500
still like well I deserve to sit here
and yeah

594
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,330
actually inning there's an article in
NYTimes about how a lot cafes

595
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:00,589
this is a problem for them has a losing
customers this the it a lot this laptop

596
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,810
takes up like four people space it's
huge

597
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,119
so these are some reasons why my own use
a cell phone jammer

598
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,589
I also want to mention them non RF
engineer so

599
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:12,109
like I don't really know what I'm
talking about but I know enough to be

600
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:13,250
dangerous

601
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:16,350
%uh so you know there's people in the
audience here

602
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,259
you know ham radio X you know way more
than I do like I pretty much like a

603
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,630
quarter wave okay

604
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:26,440
picnic divide by you know footlights
piano cats that in that at all I know

605
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,270
how to do

606
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,839
but on Thursday really good books out
there in if you read

607
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,770
um ARRL books they have lots of
information so you can actually

608
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:38,300
be educated about this but it's like the
one class in taking college

609
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,710
just is hard so basically

610
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,100
you know how to make it a cell phone
jammer it's really this way silly simple

611
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,730
you can do it more intelligently

612
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:49,910
but you're just gonna take on

613
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:53,720
a voltage-controlled oscillator which
I'll refer to is a beast BCL

614
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,359
you know standard acronym and basically
it's a little

615
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,670
metal box and you put control your power
and the control voltage and

616
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:05,580
and for example let's say we have a1 22
gigahertz PCL

617
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:08,920
if you put durable 10 it outputs 1
gigahertz if you put

618
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,150
five outs and it gives you to get hurt
and if you put two-and-a-half

619
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,720
alternatives like 1.56 basically like

620
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,770
its you know that frequent voltage to
frequency conversion it's pretty

621
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:18,880
straightforward

622
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,869
and then you want to on give it a
sawtooth wave right so it does

623
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:26,770
up in yet to sweep through frequency
bands and then

624
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:30,350
you put that in and then you you know
make sure that you have the

625
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,310
the sawtooth wave the Leinster that
lines up with the frequencies you want

626
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,170
am

627
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:37,910
and then you get this are sweet coming
out and I'll show you on spectrum

628
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,490
analyzer what that looks like

629
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,320
and these but the game against it is
really important that you be really big

630
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,310
because he's hungry really powerful

631
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,310
you just have to like be more powerful
then the South Tower

632
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:50,390
switch it it's not complicated um

633
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,040
you put some noise in there to try to
like you know spice it up

634
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,220
but I haven't found that actually very
effective

635
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,700
and so the easiest way to do this is
open-loop control

636
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,070
and anyone here is dense and you know
that this kinda sucks but it's really

637
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,390
cheap and easy

638
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,839
and basically you get your PC against
agent and they have a tuning circuit

639
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:13,350
that makes us ought to the new you get
in there with a potentiometer anyconnect

640
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,180
week it by hand the new

641
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,220
hopefully have a spectrum analyzer and
you can't L

642
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,400
what you get lined up that you're done
and then you close the box and you

643
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,410
the pop singer finished to the good
thing about this is to keep

644
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,810
it's really easy up the promises you
need a four thousand dollar spectrum

645
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,910
analyzer

646
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:32,759
so this is what actually this like thank
God the four thousand dollars everyone

647
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,390
would have

648
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,350
a cell phone jammer that's like the one
thing keeping people from building them

649
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:41,890
um so the CEOs at the interesting part
because it's like

650
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,089
depending on what the seal you get you
get different strength superpowers

651
00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:46,299
frequencies

652
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,980
so here are some be CEOs and you know
it's a quarter says gives you a sense

653
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,250
the scale

654
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,260
so there's the ones that plug in AC the
one that looks like an ant

655
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,830
and then there's the little square ones
so those are high frequencies are the

656
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:59,839
smaller they are the higher the
frequency

657
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,980
and then the one to the left is
hand-built

658
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,960
I usually buy mine I'll from any circuit
so that many tickets dot com it's great

659
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,310
you can buy any BC on the frequency of
23

660
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:14,440
hurts that's kinda nice you can go to my
hand and there's this information online

661
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,430
how to do this

662
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,330
just bc I was actually in a sense the
hardest part get

663
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:22,500
it's nice that you can build them by
hand I was incredibly successful with

664
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,230
this

665
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,390
I can get up to 1.5 gigahertz but not
much higher

666
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:30,690
see you have you can see that there's
three plugs the big silver plug is the

667
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,150
within 10 is

668
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:36,230
the right plug power on the left leg is
the tuning voltage

669
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,820
some but you said its easy if you just
buy the BCL

670
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,240
so many circuits is why I like to go
there's also well

671
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,890
micronet except this time the places
online even digikey if you do

672
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,910
electronics you probably did he catalog

673
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:52,960
the latest one includes BCS p.m. from
Sarenza

674
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,160
its new cell check that out there the
kind okay ordered some a couple days ago

675
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,830
come in all see how they work um so

676
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,440
you can see that anyone see that so I
attracted zoom and

677
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,440
to the interesting stuff so for example

678
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,040
let's say we wanna jam wifi well life I
is like one point

679
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,460
at 2.4 to 2.5 gigahertz to go down the
list in like

680
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:21,280
love I'll this this 23 good option to
the very bottom there's the Ross 2500

681
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,770
goes from 1.6 a gigahertz 2.5 gigahertz

682
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:29,710
acquires to hold stakes $25 million ants
and the power output

683
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,770
is in a is 6.5 DBM if you wanna

684
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:36,230
convert that to Mila lots to do the

685
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:39,369
divide by 10 and du Lac 10 conversion

686
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:43,470
I candid in my head you can so the
cochlear configure for me

687
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,630
and it tells you the tuning voltage also
so for example

688
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:50,150
the 2500 is point five to 14 gold so

689
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,000
there's a graph that comes the day she
you know .5 alt is going to be at the

690
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,440
lowest and in forty years then with the
highest in

691
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,830
to go through and you can mix and match
like I wanted to cell phones well

692
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:05,069
I you know you want to do 18 to 1912 you
can use the Ross 2000

693
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,410
you want to use the PTS band 8

694
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,460
800 or so you may want the 14th yeah I
think you go through any

695
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:16,460
he said it was because he wanted
ammenities pick the BCS it's that simple

696
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,910
so here's a schematic love a open-loop
control

697
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,399
and Wow

698
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,550
sino stasi Minister nice so

699
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:31,830
on the left side you can kinda see
triangle wave such a triangle wave hits

700
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,270
that

701
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,569
the tuning maker that voltage that goes
up and down

702
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:39,880
and then there's a diagnosed noise
generator I

703
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,520
didn't find that very useful but it's a
subtle look it's take the No

704
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,670
noise from a diode does really noisy in
amplifies it

705
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,770
he summed together and then you see the
big thing that says BCL

706
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:53,720
and they see the thing that says gain
stage that's it its really simple

707
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,830
and a that's what it looks like when you
build it it I have it up here if you

708
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,990
want to look at it

709
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,670
I the big square thing that has my car
not expect the VCL

710
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,700
and then the little blue thing is an
antenna and then all the messy circuit

711
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,130
stuff that's the a

712
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,300
that's that the tuning secretary and the
blue

713
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,240
square in the middle is the a
potentiometer seat with that to change

714
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:14,859
what

715
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:18,350
up frequencies you wanna jam

716
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,440
also the stuff later think yes go
through so um

717
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,770
then you turn on your really expensive
spectrum analyzer if our friend this was

718
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:26,119
actually

719
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,540
twenty thousand dollars is white in
color and

720
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,569
is look at it you can see at the bottom
it says you know

721
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:36,060
one point a kegger hurts to fight once
you get that nice

722
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,560
monolith right around 1.8 21.9 that

723
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,319
that's a GSM phone that doesn't work
anymore so when you know you wanna

724
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:43,839
upgrade

725
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:48,580
you know let's say you don't have a
spectrum analyzer or you want

726
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:52,089
you wanna go a tightly on the spectrum
analyzer or

727
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:55,779
you wanna you know deuce more dynamic
stuff you a feedback loop

728
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,230
so that P lol their sense for
phase-locked loop

729
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,619
and that's basically a a device that

730
00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:07,220
takes a high-frequency a signal compares
it to a low-frequency just some crazy

731
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:11,069
math stuff in it tells you whether
you're on the because he wants

732
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:14,460
so this is like upgraded version this is
one that

733
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,210
I just finished and it's got feedbacks a
nice thing about this is you can build

734
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,040
it you don't need a five thousand sector
and either it just works when you build

735
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,020
exit tunes itself

736
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,400
and then think

737
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,810
as well like zooming in a couple little
sayings

738
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:40,810
so there's more

739
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:48,609
so there's a 555 thanks for synonyms for
teaching me how to use my size to make

740
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,740
such as waves

741
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,940
I'm yeah this is the part that makes
that

742
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,980
you know 2240 kill her sought to and
there's some potentiometers

743
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:02,210
this one for example adjust the
bandwidth with the frequency ranges

744
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,770
and then that's actually digitally
controlled potentiometer so

745
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,770
it on the fly press a button and change
whether you wanna Gen Y fiery

746
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:16,320
you want to jam cell phones and then
that goes into the to be CEOs

747
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:20,430
I use to the seals because I wanna jam
both piece that the both the 800 van and

748
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,348
1910 and then you got your gain stage

749
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:29,859
an antenna it's the same thing you know
pretty much only difference is now

750
00:43:29,859 --> 00:43:36,859
we have you out

751
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,470
I'm not doing so well here

752
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:50,710
hahha

753
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,460
they go feel well for VCR tuning sizzle
devices nights

754
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,759
still the CL deal BC Appeal feedback
loop and it still controlled by my

755
00:43:58,759 --> 00:43:59,519
controller

756
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,819
just tells it hey I wanna be jamming
like 1.9 it hurts and it just

757
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:06,869
me but it right there and you're done
and ice

758
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:12,239
solace is going to be on

759
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,960
I guess it all the way on a website so
you like like this is going too fast but

760
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,619
we didn't go prove that you're

761
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:21,989
your leisure Sony showing that stuff
appear also if you wanna come up and

762
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:22,599
look at it

763
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,759
but basically like what what we said
well its kinda stuff is in the BX its

764
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:27,619
tying it together

765
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:33,269
just as likely use iPods to like block
out the world wall on the train

766
00:44:33,269 --> 00:44:36,289
TV on cell phone jammers the basically
like

767
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:40,009
assaying with pack too close and we need
some space

768
00:44:40,009 --> 00:44:43,769
we'd like space for Isaac the it space
for years when I cell phone conversation

769
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:44,230
so

770
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,700
design technologies to help us we claim
that space it's really powerful

771
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,950
and I think it's really necessary
especially you know at places like

772
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:55,249
urban cities and trains and bars and
other places or

773
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:59,630
were packed way too tight now there's so
many others may have to learn to live

774
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,630
with each other and

775
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,940
you know these new technologies come out
and now etiquette

776
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:07,690
%uh to go along with them develops
rather slowly much slower than the

777
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:10,730
to technologies developed so

778
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:14,480
from we can help that process us here in
this room

779
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,089
rates we have some time for people to

780
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:21,890
ask questions and then afterward you
know

781
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,700
also you can come up here and maybe I'll
show some stuff on there

782
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:32,700
overhead wanna see that

783
00:45:33,089 --> 00:45:40,089
hav rear microphone the red lights on

784
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:50,240
II yet

785
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,329
get the front mic works so

786
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:59,680
with this photo alright on you go to the
supermarket

787
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,009
and you're the checkout stand it is
annoying

788
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:07,550
TV's just sit there and spew out that
crap for your years

789
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,869
is your little TV begun work on those
yes

790
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,869
wonderful well ask a question

791
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,359
yet they're all over the place I've
never been to a Walmart but I have a lot

792
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,640
of fans have email me and said they're
very effective in wal-mart's

793
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,770
TVs that advertise their I

794
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:28,109
question on the cell phone jamming um
work how to do work out with the

795
00:46:28,109 --> 00:46:31,160
the sprint spectrum phone sensor that
was a technology to

796
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,328
designed for with BJ resistant yeah I
know that only works if it a lot of beer

797
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:39,349
a guy with a lot of papers about this
before I built it but

798
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:42,730
it just it just it works anyways and it
doesn't matter like that

799
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:46,690
remember that Nana left like 1.2 1.9 was
gone

800
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:50,619
like it was all like noise it did I mean
if you if you're jamming all the spread

801
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:51,869
spectrum that doesn't matter

802
00:46:51,869 --> 00:46:54,890
I guess yeah okay but the other thing is
that the

803
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,810
did you ever play around with maybe
using some with the chip code sequences

804
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,220
that

805
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,460
that the a that the CDMA phones use

806
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,660
that good i mean that that will be more
have a lot of people have been

807
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,578
mentioning that and I think that's a
really good idea

808
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:11,609
you can like really reduce your power
like I said this is like this is a

809
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:13,650
denial of service attacks was brainless

810
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,109
like brute force way of doing it but
yeah just because like

811
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,420
dick you could use a light easier with
this a little bit more intelligence I

812
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,599
still have intelligence

813
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,690
okay I A and funny thing when the TV B
Gone on

814
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,560
did you ever play around with using any
the pics the pic processes or

815
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,349
or you can write to that does i mix on
redtube is I like Gonzalez relieve the

816
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:35,540
main reason I chose I like is cuz

817
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,460
I had a development system already I C
and it's also pretty cheap bomb

818
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:44,310
that ships for II developed it on
one-time programmable chips

819
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:48,250
and thereof five dollars appease

820
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:52,170
if you buy one more than upik processor

821
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,650
but the development environments arm was
thirty five dollars but they gave it to

822
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,480
me for free

823
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,500
cuz they like me with all these places
all you have to do is say hey on

824
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,280
developing something I might sell a
million ships and they go

825
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,540
okay we'll give you development
environment om

826
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,990
and you don't have to be telling the
truth

827
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,069
well I thought just I'll just have to
reprogram my pics it

828
00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:17,880
to go from the a general instruments
called to the soulful

829
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:22,390
yeah so have you found that the TV B
Gone

830
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:27,460
terms of other things like the players
are stereo systems like that and if so

831
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,260
white right well %uh manufactures

832
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,500
p.m. wanna difficult things with the why
it took me a year as

833
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:40,079
there so many different ways that
manufacturers do their infrared remote

834
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:40,760
controls

835
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,740
but some its it would be an amazing flu

836
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,300
if one manufacturer who isn't talking to
other manufacturer had a same code

837
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,319
for anything as another manufacturer on
as it turns out though I have a

838
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,599
to emails from people who bought the
beyond saying that

839
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:02,849
it turned off their PCR so there's at
least one

840
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:06,710
PCR out there that will turn off wifi

841
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,810
1 I've the TV off coats & TV on

842
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:14,440
so it's probably by the same manufacture
if

843
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:18,079
a microphone down just I

844
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,150
yeah I was just going to comment on the

845
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,380
miles away us hull Ave

846
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,630
up yeah a lot at the

847
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:33,069
the manufactures you know they buy a
chip from Cigna rates or

848
00:49:33,069 --> 00:49:36,609
you know he never the chip manufacturers
a sony makes them

849
00:49:36,609 --> 00:49:40,040
if you're why go: the to hear that
design making are

850
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,079
I R chip each product for each you know

851
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,119
different I've tried to seize the same
chip in on their product line

852
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:49,319
as that spyware of course that's why
you're lucky only have

853
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:52,500
do some hundred-odd of codes and seven
thousand after

854
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,690
dow some there's there's

855
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,180
thousands and thousands of different
keys out there and

856
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:03,118
down there are some

857
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,390
some sort of standardized ways of doing
it but even

858
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:10,060
within those standardize ways are so
many variations of the way they've put

859
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,500
together to distinguish

860
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,710
at we gotta stop now so arm

861
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:16,560
thanks everybody
