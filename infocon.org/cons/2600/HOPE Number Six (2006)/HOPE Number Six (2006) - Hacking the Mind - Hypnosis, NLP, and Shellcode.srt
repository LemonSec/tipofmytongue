1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:07,140
linguistic programming and shelter thank
you can you guys in

2
00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:12,490
okay mike is on good alright so

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,710
as I'm sure you guys will learn a little
while after I've been talking for a bit

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,770
him insist upon the stories and

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,160
so I'm gonna start of by talking

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,290
a little bit about a story that fits in
with the

7
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,369
the tradition in this talk in the
tradition of hypnosis

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,449
sign a start with something I was

9
00:00:33,449 --> 00:00:37,480
walking through the fifth straight to
Toronto where I'm from the other day

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,249
and I was on my way to the subway and I
have a thing for t-shirts which

11
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:45,300
makes this conference really call
coverage gap excellent T-shirts

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,690
and ice are really great t-shirt that

13
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,769
said by reading this you've already
given me control over tiny slice if

14
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:53,309
you're mine

15
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,999
and as I walk by I want by the girl
wearing it I stepped on the escalator

16
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:02,510
as I started down in the ass clip down
the escalator I started thinking

17
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:06,298
about what that shirt said what actually
meant and

18
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,159
I found a really interesting because as
a hypnotist it you know I don't go

19
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,119
around talking about being held at this
very often

20
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,149
because it's sorta look down on like who
you know you can't control my mind but

21
00:01:17,149 --> 00:01:20,689
we all come from you know we all give
away our convo control over Mainz every

22
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,039
day

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:26,340
you know by watching TV by seeing the
ads on billboards outside but I'm

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,270
missing the radio

25
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,810
each of us allows someone to control a
tiny slice far mine each day

26
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,880
and I got thinking that

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,429
it's similar to the way that people you
happy sprite iron

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,700
the way that people look at it tests as
somewhat

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,649
a little bit scared is often the way
that we as as hackers are perceived as

30
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:46,060
well

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,710
and so as I

32
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,799
as I got off the escalator I started
thinking back to the first time

33
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,200
that I was really you know sort of

34
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,570
identified as a hacker in the same way
that sometimes I'm

35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,079
you know load to be identified as a
hypnotist and I got thinking about the

36
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,109
first time that I

37
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:09,670
did anything that really so to cross the
line and

38
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,360
was back in college and I was working

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,599
for a really cheesy online dating site
at their

40
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:20,768
I'm their internal call center so is an
inbound call center so we just sat there

41
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,019
and waited for the phone to ring

42
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:26,620
and like I'm sure many people have
experienced here if you're a

43
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,330
customer service crime you don't do it
you know your now expected to know what

44
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:31,299
the computer does

45
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,120
it was an old auntie box and it was put
on call lockdown on

46
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,190
and I got bored and decided I wanted to
get out get access to tell that check my

47
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:40,690
email

48
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:44,430
at the university and so and I tried

49
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,190
watching run window and that didn't work
and I tried looking the programs list

50
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,720
and it wasn't there and I tried

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,799
Control Alt Delete in watching a program
on a task manager

52
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,590
another's work but we had a web browser
so I type telnet colon slash lastingly

53
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,620
address bar and I had a time when which
was wonderful

54
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,069
on but then I tried to check my email
and I don't have

55
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:11,480
so I have three hours left in my shift
and I'm still bored

56
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,769
and suffice it to say the next thing I
did

57
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:19,930
was started playing with the network and
found a router with no password on it

58
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,690
and then found a Solaris box that had

59
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,549
I'm the password and login banner which
is quite nice

60
00:03:27,549 --> 00:03:31,989
and then started noticing trust
relationships with places in our hosts

61
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,150
files all over the place

62
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,420
and by the end of my shift me as a lowly
customer service rep

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,980
had owned about 50 boxes on four counts
are

64
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,049
I can tell you I was well liked that
night because

65
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,519
the next thing I did actually changed my
life in a big way the next thing I did

66
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,829
just as my ship was ending

67
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,430
was that I told my boss about and

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,640
we'll save that for later because that
actually reminded me as I was reading

69
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,079
this

70
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,879
about another story that's a story that
originated in the monasteries in Japan

71
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,299
that a good friend of mine often like to
tell

72
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,859
and is this the store even I really
mischievous

73
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:13,060
young lad named Cody and

74
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,089
I'll tell you Koji these days would be a
hacker are

75
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,329
because Koji was

76
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,610
too smart for his own good and he was
mischievous

77
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,370
and whenever he got bored he got himself
into trouble and eventually coaches

78
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,270
parents got sick if coach being in
trouble

79
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,770
and decided to send them off to a
monastery somewhat like senate get to

80
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,080
military school these days

81
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,370
on and the ship them off but

82
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,139
code you remain poor he was born at the
monastery just like he was born in

83
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:41,690
Israel I

84
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,300
and suddenly he started to

85
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,419
get himself in trouble there and
eventually

86
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:52,020
Cody getting himself in trouble enough
found himself in the Headmaster's

87
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,590
borders

88
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:57,220
up the monster and the headmaster
started talking to him about

89
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,680
responsibility and

90
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,990
you know all the sorts of things school
principal probably talk to you about

91
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,060
some point and

92
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,530
while he's doing that the headmaster was
getting

93
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,570
at a large jar can you're sitting back
relaxing in his couch because you can do

94
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,699
that in your head master monastery just
popping candy in use now

95
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,770
and could you haven't seen candy in a
long time and he said

96
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,539
hey whats you know secondly and
headmaster said no that's not candy

97
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:28,830
thats poison for young boys

98
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,440
its candy for adults the typeof live it
many adults tell many children as I'm

99
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,300
sure you all know

100
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,659
and some code you gave was given his
punishment he was required to do extra

101
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:40,930
chores the beginning the day

102
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,240
extra charge the other day and because
he was a

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,190
incredibly smart and industrious young
boy you have any problems

104
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:52,360
achieving those tasks are

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,419
and soon as happened in monastery
culture in Japan

106
00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,020
the headmaster was called away to visit
another monster and this is the all day

107
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,669
so

108
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,979
they all you know he went in a large
procession had

109
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,099
you know people carrying his trunks and
all that sort of thing in many the

110
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:07,889
adults left

111
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,990
and so

112
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,469
things went on as normal for a while
with many adults gone

113
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:17,360
was quiet around the monastery but the
kids kept doing what they were doing

114
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,169
until eventually Koji found himself

115
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,719
or to get and one night he was talking
with a bunch of the other kids

116
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:29,070
he said hey guess what I know where we
can get some candy and so they broke

117
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,669
into the Headmaster's quarters after

118
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:36,180
late-night and Ste you know this was a
huge jerk and I mean this is like

119
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,500
you know this period which is twice the
height of young kid and

120
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,550
they started eating candy in the a few

121
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,870
and then ate a few more in probably if
they don't

122
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,849
if they'd stop there nobody would notice
but soon enough

123
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:54,800
after eating a few more the jar was
empty and

124
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,360
all the kids suddenly looked up and said
oh my gosh when we gonna do

125
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:03,289
they're gonna kill us when I come back
we're debt and Koji said

126
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,090
or at a plant he looked down to the

127
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,520
end of the round and on my on the
Headmaster's hearth

128
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,139
was the prized possession other
monasteries

129
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:18,020
ancient vase that can had gone back
hundreds of years that I've been wanting

130
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,599
some great warrant was a story that all
the boys knew about

131
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,110
this particular race and pride monastery
took in the face

132
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,970
code you walk down he picked up the vase

133
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,680
and he slammed it on the floor
shattering into a million pieces

134
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,680
and the boys were positively stuff and
no idea what to do

135
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,740
cell let's talk a little bit about
hacking nice

136
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,050
I'm

137
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,610
this is what I'm gonna go over today

138
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,759
those who don't know

139
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,840
I'm not just to have a test in my quote
unquote day job I manage a vulnerability

140
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,490
research team

141
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,270
so I am a hacker as well on I got into
hypnosis because

142
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,270
computers are interesting but the pretty
linear

143
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,799
whereas the human mind is a million
times more complex and even more

144
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,509
interesting

145
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,659
than you can possibly imagine so because
I know that many have you understand the

146
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:17,750
concepts are packing

147
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,650
I'm going to bring some %uh those
concepts about the human mind

148
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,129
to you let's start with just a little
bit about

149
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,659
you know what is happening you know I
think everybody in the room knows what

150
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:29,389
happens

151
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,810
but unfortunately I think most people in
the room probably have a pretty

152
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,269
messed up version what hypnosis

153
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,820
I'm somebody might have expected me to
dangle watch up here

154
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,029
or call somebody up on stage making bark
like a dog

155
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,970
I'm you know control someone's mind

156
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,940
make them forget things of that sort of
stuff knows this isn't really like that

157
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,130
that's about as much hypnosis as

158
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,860
anyone who's seen the movie hackers
thats hacking are

159
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,040
you know Angelina Jolie in that movie
was great but

160
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,769
the movie had nothing to do with
real-life I wish I could fly for

161
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:06,610
computers like that

162
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,890
I'm hypnosis is really the art of
communicating

163
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,670
and helping someone be in a state so
that they can hear whatever message you

164
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,439
want them to hear

165
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,600
and using especially

166
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,839
an understanding of what the unconscious
mind here's there's two parts to your

167
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,149
mind is the conscious mind which year
where every day

168
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,670
and then there's the unconscious part of
your mind which does things like your

169
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,310
heart beating

170
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,730
and create dreams for you at night and
all those other parts of your brain

171
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,329
we hear so little about hypnosis is
really

172
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,680
the Act a structure in communication to
speak to

173
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,329
that pardon mein so that you can make
the most effective communication

174
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,380
n at any given time so

175
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,579
I put some rules up there sort of the
knowledge

176
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,339
required to be able to hack and also to
me the

177
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,550
knowledge required to build the team do
hypnosis

178
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:04,440
I think that anyone has had who has
spent a lot of time

179
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,000
you know hacking around on any sort of
system would agree that those four

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,050
principles a pretty

181
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,800
universal it doesn't matter whether you
like the guys before me who were

182
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,779
building on a Mac weapons out of

183
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,920
nail guns or arm

184
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,020
you know where you're breaking into
computer or you're creating code all of

185
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,649
that is some

186
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:27,449
so let's talk about exploitation shali

187
00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:31,699
since everyone here probably probably
knows a little bit about that

188
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:35,560
there's really three types if

189
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,110
you know computer exploits and I wanna
talk about today

190
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,760
I'm first was the buffer overflow which
I'm sure everyone knows about

191
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,110
or is at least somewhat comfortable with
the second one

192
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,790
is the confusion a process in contact
which we see

193
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,719
in in the computer world s the format
string attack

194
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,350
and then data-driven attacks attacks
that happened because

195
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,180
the commander in the day to answer in a
particular way the way you

196
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,329
create contact for human to be

197
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,410
quote-unquote exploited I don't like
that word when talking about humans is

198
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:09,870
not right

199
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,120
quite the right word is exactly the same
way

200
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,350
you do it when you doing it for computer
and I'm gonna walk through a little bit

201
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:16,769
about

202
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,310
feature that just talk about but let's
talk about buffer overflows

203
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:24,649
the mine has limitations in very much
the same way computers

204
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,910
think about a computer buffer overflow
you know

205
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:32,339
me writing bad see their basically I
have a buffer

206
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,649
and I start feeling it and I've actually
run out and I over for the buffer

207
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,440
that should probably be review for most
other people in the room how to surf

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,910
the human side works the same way

209
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,850
human buffer flows buffer overflows
actually based on what we call

210
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,220
open loops andalucía simply the
beginning to thaw

211
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:55,740
I'm actually the completion of our a
loop is

212
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,930
I begin a story and 2-story I'm

213
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,089
you know we start talking about one
thing we finished talking about that

214
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,010
thing what you find in humans

215
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:10,709
is if you start opening a whole lot of
hoops but never close any

216
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:15,170
things start to happen really
interesting life are

217
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,930
and anyone who's ever who's ever talk to
someone who's artful about this

218
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,949
am usually you know philosophy majors

219
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:26,339
are you know people who have been
philosophers have a tendency to open a

220
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,850
while that really quickly

221
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,470
and you find yourself suddenly very
confused

222
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,860
not knowing where they're going or where
they've been and that's exactly how it

223
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:35,410
works

224
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,980
you start opening lives and then you
don't close them

225
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,660
and eventually the person just can't
follow consciously

226
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,689
because there's an old study someone you
may have heard a

227
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:50,510
that says that human beings can process
that can hold in memory at a given time

228
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,589
seven plus or minus two chunks of
information

229
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:57,520
so if you're thinking about a phone
number if I ask you to remember phone

230
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,250
number as

231
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,339
each individual digit you probably would
have a very hard time with it

232
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,319
but instead we do it in chunks of three
or chance it three in a trunk a4

233
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,819
right you think the area code than the
first reduced

234
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:13,240
the second three digits and you've only
got three transit information so it's

235
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,550
really easy

236
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,050
on this is how you know you see people

237
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,529
who are quote-unquote memory experts I'm

238
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,689
I once knew somebody who could recite
hide 300 is

239
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:32,089
on what's interesting is he very using
very much the technology of Chongqing

240
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:35,209
taught me to have memorized by 2:30 did
its so

241
00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:39,740
its it's not hard it's really easy to do
if you use Chongqing appropriately

242
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,790
but if you can't chunks the loops if the
loops are simply

243
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,990
opened and you have too much data to be
able to process

244
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:51,279
consciously where does all that other
day to go

245
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,199
on other data goes directly to the
unconscious mind

246
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,819
and you can start making changes that
way

247
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:02,199
I'm what you'll find is really great
hypnotists

248
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,809
work almost exclusively with the
unconscious mind will do some stuff

249
00:14:05,809 --> 00:14:08,140
consciously just for

250
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,209
just for the accurate you know just so
that you feel like they actually talk to

251
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,630
you for a few minutes

252
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,089
but generally it works directly on the
unconscious

253
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:20,250
start a format strings for a sec

254
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,500
I'm format strings are a little more

255
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,649
esoteric when it comes to talking about

256
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,790
actual export basically

257
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,420
I'm format string happens when the
computer confuses the content it's given

258
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,809
with the process that it's supposed to
be following so

259
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:47,649
you can see the code the code fragment
there that's Kanak strain

260
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,720
if you put content into it it doesn't
know whether it's contact content

261
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,870
blah blah blah or formats track

262
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:58,550
and how do I am how to interpret so what
you have is the computer

263
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,179
trying to figure out and making a
mistake literally just making a mistake

264
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:06,439
causing the percent ask in the contact

265
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,870
to be treated as process the way it's
posted do things

266
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,270
and that allows you to jump to another
memory location and take control the

267
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,610
computer in some cases

268
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,100
otherwise it just make stuff crash arm

269
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,910
works the same way when you're talking

270
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,040
you can create ambiguous statements

271
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,800
that the mind doesn't know whether

272
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,660
its content or whether its process

273
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:42,339
so you find that people who hadn't just
spent a lot of time

274
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,779
studying language and especially
studying syntax

275
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,990
the the old example

276
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,000
is the sentence hypnotize ng hypnotist

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,040
are tricky really simple sense right

278
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,160
forwards does that mean it's tricky to
hypnotize a hypnotist

279
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,640
does that mean the hypnotist is tricky
when they're hypnotizing

280
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,270
what does it specifically me

281
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,420
you don't know which is why I'm

282
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,459
you know which is what I can use to than

283
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,870
structure a message in order for your
unconscious to hear

284
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,459
rather than structuring the message for
your conscious to understand

285
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,639
often you know that you know I have a a
favorite hypnotist

286
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,720
friend of mine who I'm likes to use the
phrase

287
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,110
when you realize with your real us

288
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,339
then you will understand because it's
the same set a phonetic statements

289
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:43,569
realize and real eyes and

290
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,920
there are multiple there are multiple
ways of understanding

291
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,639
I'm this is all going to come together a
little bit and the next statement but

292
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,170
what you will find is that

293
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,750
hypnosis is really about confusion

294
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,339
and if you find yourself confused in the
middle of this talk

295
00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,879
consider that a good sign

296
00:17:06,879 --> 00:17:11,389
actually I think I was thinking earlier
that it's kinda cool because

297
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:15,179
you know being a hypnotist and being up
here its problem I'm probably the only

298
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,439
person who if you guys start nodding off
in the middle by talk

299
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:23,169
I'm take that as a good sign I can
notice that you just close your eyes and

300
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:26,780
gone into tracks whereas

301
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,210
if anyone else did you be asleep

302
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,550
so talking about specifically content
attacks

303
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,790
content itself can sometimes be
attacking you see that in me

304
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,668
hacking world often when you think about
web-based attacks

305
00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:45,750
right sequel injection it's not

306
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,510
that yeah it's a little bit like the
format string attack in a you're seeing

307
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,870
somewhat

308
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,280
on somewhat that the

309
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,658
process and the content or being
confused but really hear the content is

310
00:17:58,659 --> 00:17:59,800
the instruction

311
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,470
rather than having to jump to another
memory space and then

312
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,520
architectural code for that family space
the instruction becomes part of the

313
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,929
content your not jumping around

314
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:13,460
has just in the middle of the contact
and

315
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,770
so we haven't we have an hour manana
login

316
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,889
when you're thinking about human minds
which reminds me

317
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:28,280
have a story so

318
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,129
I heard the story once and I'm going to
change it a little bit

319
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:36,929
so there's a hacker one-time who broke
into a massive supercomputer

320
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,899
for anybody who saw the movie hackers is
called the Gibson

321
00:18:41,899 --> 00:18:46,450
packer is so excited about it he jumps
up from his bedroom was working late at

322
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:48,389
night goes and tells us for me

323
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:51,500
his roommate happens to be a sociologist

324
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,330
and his sociology roommate

325
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,610
says oh man you got you've got Gibson

326
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,679
I need to ask a question is a question
only the biggest supercomputer in the

327
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:05,050
world to possibly answer

328
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,570
is hackers like I write whatever
sociology boy let's let's go play with

329
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,470
computer

330
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,570
so they type into the computer do you
compute

331
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,860
you will ever think like a human being

332
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,800
and the process bar jumped up on screen
because it's got that funky TV

333
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,790
interface and the computer indications
results gonna take

334
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,200
all night and so

335
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,560
instead if going to

336
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,610
get more caffeine she can be up all
night

337
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:42,110
the to decide to go to bed and when they
wake up in the morning

338
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,700
computers given the result and so

339
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,830
they eagerly rushed to the computer to
see what the result is

340
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,050
and on the screen it says reminds me

341
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,770
a story

342
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:59,780
because humans thinking stories and
metaphors and patterns

343
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,670
because the unconscious mind understands
patterns

344
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,800
that's why we see in the culture
humanity

345
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,909
for thousands of years how r house
knowledge transition house knowledge

346
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,680
passed down it's passed down through
stories

347
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,940
you know we have fairy tales that last
hundreds of thousands of years the story

348
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,460
Koji which I started earlier

349
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,560
is an ancient story it's lasted longer

350
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,840
then you know our great great great
grandparents

351
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,929
were probably you know would

352
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:33,680
probably heard that is an old story and
so you'll find as i mentioned at the

353
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,700
beginning of this

354
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,230
hypnotists like stars and

355
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,080
one of the main reasons for that is
because stories

356
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,760
have within them patterns that go
directly to the unconscious mind

357
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,760
and Leo a lot to you a man im not
Merrick said I'm action is widely

358
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,780
regarded as the world's greatest

359
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,620
a therapist and therapy with Ericsson
was once described as

360
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:03,230
simply you walk in Erickson's office you
sit down he tells your story and

361
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,360
suddenly your life changes

362
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,610
and though that sounds somewhat
ridiculous

363
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,640
it actually was that way there are huge
books

364
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,920
written on just the stories that
Ericsson talk

365
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:19,570
because his stories were so incredibly
powerful

366
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,159
he knew how to tell you a story that
would create a frame

367
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,240
in which your whole life which shift
your whole life kinship

368
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,440
simply from hearing a story and so

369
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,480
that is where the real power for the
unconscious mind is

370
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,420
but now we've talked about

371
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,960
moving you know executing the exploit
let's talk about actually are

372
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,370
executing code because nobody wants to
just das a box

373
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,520
I can stand up here and tell you want to
stuff and make you forget it all

374
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,040
but that wouldn't be very interesting
know it I'm

375
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,680
so the points to actually do something
and if anybody's ever written in

376
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,150
exploit and see you know there's two
pieces you have to do know of sled

377
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,450
and then you have to actually craft the
shellcode to make the computer do you

378
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:13,050
want to do

379
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,240
as I'm sure you've guessed by now

380
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,310
that's same way it works the same way in
hypnosis

381
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:22,429
so it's a no upside like for Humanity

382
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:27,460
for human brain the point even know up
sled is really simple

383
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,530
after I've started my exploit I want to
give the computer enough time to make

384
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,970
sure the exploit goes through
appropriately

385
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,630
I wanna go deeper and deeper and deeper
into memory space

386
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,950
so that I know I have lots of room to
work how do you do that with people

387
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,290
the answer is pretty simple

388
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,600
you become art what is known as being
artfully Bay

389
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,780
using language that

390
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,139
corresponds to any human experience so

391
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,760
much like you know up there's no way
that the computer can go

392
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,620
hey I don't like to do that so you're
fine

393
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,630
that if you listen to him tests or

394
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,660
if you listen to political speech
because

395
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,550
flat-out almost all political speeches
hypnosis in some way

396
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,510
I what you'll find is an incredible
amount of Vegas

397
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,770
George Lakoff was a brilliant
philosopher

398
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,710
at I'm at the University berkeley just
read a book called whose freedom

399
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,690
that is that focuses on the use of the
word freedom

400
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:35,800
in the last fifteen years and the way
the word freedom

401
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,490
has been used to co-ops most human
experience

402
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,910
you know we just had a we just had a war
in Iraq

403
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,150
for freedom I personally think was the
freedom for Halliburton to make a lot of

404
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:47,590
money

405
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,919
but the question

406
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,970
love the unspecified now unspecified

407
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,620
for whose freedom is it or when you're
talking about hypnosis you'll find that

408
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,680
instead of me saying to someone and you
may find it

409
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,320
you can become more relaxed actually
that's probably what I would say

410
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,760
you may find that your Legos goes
particularly tingly right now

411
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,610
very specific statement you're either
going to say yes or you're going to say

412
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,140
now

413
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,090
I'm if that happens to be exactly what
you're experiencing a work really well

414
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,169
if it happens me know if you're
experiencing a shaker add me on us

415
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,440
alright

416
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,700
so what I would probably say something
like

417
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,200
and you can find that your leg has a
particular sensation

418
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,900
and you can notice that you continue to
breed now

419
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,400
and maybe something changes in the way
he blinked that's right

420
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,910
because all those things you're gonna do
you know

421
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,170
I certainly hope you're gonna continue
to breed because if you don't weaker

422
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,680
real problem but

423
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,620
it's funny because I can stand up here
and it's it's silly but if you listen to

424
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:58,890
them

425
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:02,080
if you listen to the news if you listen
to the media that's the kind of

426
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,990
statements that

427
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:08,150
man I love white house press conferences
because they making really vague

428
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:10,170
statements that no one can disagree with

429
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,380
and so it maxed all in everyone's
experience

430
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,760
political speeches are brilliant for
this but

431
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,780
that's the way you go deeper into that
relationship you go deeper and deeper

432
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,840
as the person continues to talk because
they're not saying anything can possibly

433
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,290
disagree with at which point

434
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,780
then you can start

435
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,899
to create instructions and literally

436
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,000
it simply the point to start executing
Co

437
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,440
I'm what erikson found is that

438
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,660
the unconscious mind won't actually
respond to direct instructions

439
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,190
so if you're working with someone you
want them to quit smoking for example

440
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,930
you can't say that I'm you're going to
stop smoking what you can say

441
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,150
is that you can give them a the
opportunity and you can find it

442
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:06,370
it's possible that now you may not need
to smoke anymore

443
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,770
you may find that you don't need to

444
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,120
you may find that the craving goes away
I'm

445
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,470
but notice I'm not saying that it will
I'm just giving the option

446
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:22,080
this is the way the unconscious mind
works and conscious mind doesn't work

447
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,530
with

448
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:28,389
directed statements particularly well
what's really interesting

449
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:33,920
is that there is an even more powerful
pata there's an even more powerful way

450
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,980
to structure communication for the
unconscious mind

451
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,220
and it's interesting because

452
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,850
I think if someone told you this you
think they were crazy

453
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,320
maybe you can I think I'm crazy but

454
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,450
there's an incredibly powerful language
pattern

455
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,100
that can allow you to execute any
arbitrary code within

456
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,410
anyone's bring so

457
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:03,360
can you imagine just for a minute what
that would be like you imagine

458
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:10,360
if there was such a language barrier I
think you care

459
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:17,320
it does exist doesn't it and if not
consciously

460
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,320
you know what it is sonya at threat
important to the question the question

461
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:29,478
simply cannot be avoided

462
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:32,769
by the unconscious mind you cannot ask
someone a question

463
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:37,239
without them answering they may not
answer directly verbally

464
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:42,009
but in order to listen to the language
in order to hear me say it

465
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:45,450
you have to process it

466
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,849
which means you have executed whatever
the instruction is on some other

467
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:53,589
knowing how to use questions artfully

468
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,849
and I was just playing with them a
second ago but knowing how to use

469
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:57,989
questions are fully

470
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:04,019
is really the key to understanding how
to structure contact for

471
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:11,019
the unconscious mind alright

472
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:14,460
so we left less last left coaching

473
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,440
he just broken vase and

474
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,700
all his friends were terrified and they
found that

475
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,160
they spent the next

476
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,940
the next few weeks been particularly
quiet

477
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,460
everyone is terrified. when the
headmaster would come

478
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,030
and soon enough as always happens in
stories

479
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:41,809
headmaster did come home and of course

480
00:28:41,809 --> 00:28:46,539
the moment he went up to his room he
noticed that the base was broken

481
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:50,470
and the jar was empty and he was
particularly angry

482
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:53,850
and call a voice together

483
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:59,100
demanded to know who did it and Koji
stepped forward and said

484
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,559
i det ser now the boys were particularly
happy to let code you take the credit

485
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,039
because they didn't want to take the
credit

486
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:09,280
they didn't wanna have to get punished
for it so they were happy that he did

487
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,360
and the headmaster you know

488
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,570
grad coaching by the year and drag them
up to his office and demanded to know

489
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:23,260
why did you do this and Koji said

490
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:27,250
I'm really sorry how

491
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,039
you know you gave me all those extra
chores and

492
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,570
I was thinking when they was doing max
for sure is that you've been gone a long

493
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:35,240
time

494
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,370
and of course your room musket dusty and
so

495
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,950
one day I came up here and decided that

496
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,950
you know as a as a gift for you

497
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:50,789
because you've been so wonderful to me I
would clean your room

498
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:56,429
while you were gone but I'm a very
little boy I can handle the broom

499
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:01,240
the brooms taller than me and I'm slip
with the broom and I'm not the base of

500
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:01,669
the show

501
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:05,440
and then

502
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,480
I was so upset I was

503
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,610
I just want to die as I couldn't handle
it anymore

504
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,510
and I realized that you yourself

505
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:24,360
had told me how to kill myself so I went
to the base

506
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,929
and I took a piece a candy estar en
route to

507
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:33,780
and you know I said my prayers and I a
day nothing happened so I ate another

508
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:37,149
and another and another and another and
I just kept eating

509
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,150
and they were all gone and I wasn't dead

510
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:47,150
didn't know what to do later that night
could you in bed could you went back to

511
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,950
his room with all the other boys

512
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,490
shortly after the light was off somebody
in the room was for

513
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,490
so tell us what happened and Koji said

514
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,559
well I told them what happened and

515
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,040
than when I left the office

516
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,149
i bout and he bout to me

517
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:15,230
and years later Koji became the
headmaster

518
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,549
that monster and

519
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,690
that was sorta how I was feeling

520
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,400
when I finished telling my boss Apple
Store

521
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,200
and

522
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,799
so I went home after telling the whole
story

523
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:36,580
and that was when all hell broke loose
at that company they will get the CEO at

524
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,559
11:30 at night

525
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:41,460
on a Friday I'm because they had a
hacker

526
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:46,240
and was an internal hacker and all
freaked out was probably really good for

527
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,809
them because they took the password and
login banner

528
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:53,629
but the password on the router and
everything got better and

529
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,480
I got the phone call to come in on
Monday even I wasn't scheduled to work

530
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,490
and I went into

531
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,980
in my case the Headmaster's office in
this case by

532
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,100
bosses bosses boss who had met once and
he asked me what

533
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:16,790
y donde I told them simply I was bored
and

534
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:22,379
it was a really interesting experience
because I fully expected to get fired

535
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,660
that day and instead of firing me he
move me to Q eighteen

536
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,790
and I started doing

537
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,809
that kind of work on a daily basis and
so

538
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,918
this was

539
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,130
you know was an incredible experience

540
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,460
and as I got off the train and start
writing back up the escalator

541
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,540
to get to where I was going I continue
to think about

542
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,379
that original teacher and I noticed a
woman wearing a t-shirt and it was a

543
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,900
particularly tight t-shirt and

544
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,350
on it was bright pink and the teacher
said

545
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,960
thank you for your attention which I
found quite amusing

546
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,049
and I walked out into the street and
noticed that

547
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,370
I was out in sunny day like surrounding
me and everything was wonderful

548
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,620
and I was back in the real world and

549
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,720
so I'd like to thank everybody for
listening I'd like to thank the

550
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,320
attention

551
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,960
I'm gonna post the slides on the wiki
here

552
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,590
here

553
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,880
feel free to email me I'm I love talking

554
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,920
so if there's any questions

555
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,710
I'd love to take a nap yep he's taken to
Mike

556
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:49,710
very nice talk very artfully done

557
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,360
thank you word you draw a line between

558
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,690
disease and consistently 10 players and
stuff that's

559
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,110
well so really funny on the two founders
are now P

560
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:04,400
what often start hypnosis seminar with a
great discussion

561
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,650
one of them would say everything is a is
hypnosis

562
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:12,040
and the other one say now you're crazy
nothing sickness is no such thing are

563
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,239
hypnosis is simply the art of
structuring communication which

564
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,840
and LP is as well they overlap in a lot
of places

565
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,480
and I generally tend not to draw the
distinction on

566
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,690
you know there are a lot of people out
there do it's all communication and

567
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,630
things that you learn answer in you know
Robert shielding his work on influence

568
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,350
for example

569
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:36,569
are very effective in hypnosis things
you learn in neurology about how the

570
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,130
brain works a very effective in

571
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,640
these places it all ties together at all
it all comes together it's like

572
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,859
like asking me what the you know where I
draw the line between

573
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,040
I'm between programming in assembly

574
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,520
and cutting export you know its

575
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,679
there there's a line but the skills in
the same make sense

576
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,520
so what happened to the sociologists
with the supercomputer

577
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:05,550
what I mean because you never finished
so you basically still open that

578
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,060
I know that was closed that was both

579
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:12,259
that was the end of a star there's no
there's no continuation

580
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,610
in the second questions have you ever
use any methods to

581
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,270
apply to your yields I suppose wanna
believe

582
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:24,790
consulting assessment man i've help my
team doesn't get all these DVD's

583
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,320
I'm yeah I I don't think that you can

584
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,660
ice I said a minute ago everything is
hypnosis or nothing that's right

585
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:37,100
I'm the I started learning a lot of this
because

586
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,250
I had to suddenly become a manager and

587
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:44,440
I knew a lot about how to hack computers
and not very much but how to hack people

588
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,620
I'm and so I started learning this with
that intent and so

589
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,200
anyone who's ever reported to me with
you know

590
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
would say that I tell a lot of stories
so

591
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,960
knowing what you do gives you a
significant amount of power over other

592
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,500
people

593
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,700
and that on manifests

594
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,890
not necessarily on

595
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:13,500
willfully because you are as familiar as
you are with how people work

596
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,020
you're able to and through your

597
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,960
not entirely conscious actions use it on

598
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,000
how do you judge your own

599
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,140
morality in the search the circumstances

600
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,529
I think we're asking is do I use my
powers for good and not evil not entire

601
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:36,850
saying that you use your powers yeah so
don't always use them

602
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:40,259
with full intent I can answer that I'm
you now

603
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,950
its you're right and it's very much like
hacking computers right we have a lot of

604
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:48,710
powers hackers we've learned to do
things that the normal population can't

605
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,960
do

606
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,230
on and it takes a certain amount of
integrity

607
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,000
you know what there are people out there
on I recently was

608
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,840
was working with someone who you know
was learning the skills

609
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,490
and that person told me that they didn't
believe in ethics

610
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,710
and I was like who at which point I
start telling a few stories about the

611
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:10,760
importance of integrity

612
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,400
on and so

613
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,690
I believe that as you know

614
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,240
I've been really lucky to work with
people who have a lot of integrity as

615
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,270
they've trained me

616
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,490
they told me a lot of stories about
integrity that's not to say that there

617
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,650
are people out here

618
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,660
in the world that are going to use that
on

619
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,870
that said information that it's a tool
just like anything

620
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:38,190
you know you can use a hammer to build a
house or you can use a hammer to destroy

621
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,530
something and

622
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,010
that said my own integrity is such that

623
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,920
you know I'm I'm always looking to make
positive change in the world

624
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,920
I want to going to the World impact
everything I touch in a positive way

625
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,030
I want to build something beautiful
rather than destroy so

626
00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:00,100
when I'm working with someone whether
it's in a therapeutic context or whether

627
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,509
it's

628
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,470
on a team or whether it's just you know
meeting someone in a in a bar whenever

629
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,540
I'm my intent is always

630
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:11,660
to have a to leave a positive mark on
the world

631
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,149
on thats that's all I can and I can only
speak from my integrity

632
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm I certainly met people out there
take this stuff and use it badly

633
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,730
you know I mention political speech for
a reason

634
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,030
thank you absolutely

635
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:31,890
Heath um

636
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,460
do you find yourself less susceptible to
these techniques

637
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,480
since so know how they work on yeah I
find myself noticing them a lot more

638
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,240
it's amazing how many how often this
stuff happens

639
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,070
you know how often think about
commercials you often see it I'm gonna

640
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,520
use a

641
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,590
example I talked about embedding things
in the middle of loops right

642
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,390
I'm you'll see commercial it'll start a
story beginning commercial

643
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,930
and then tell you all about the product
demand and Indian store

644
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,350
right this happens in the real world
every day

645
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,520
and I find myself noticing that you know
just like

646
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,560
just like when when you guys watch a
movie you probably notice what OS is on

647
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,640
the screen

648
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,790
in the movie right i know i do. on

649
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,430
because you're sensitized to because
that's your world so because this is my

650
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,370
world I notice those things too

651
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,330
have you ever considered trying to give
some general advice to people

652
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,569
mine you know people who watch political
speeches

653
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,440
things to look for waited to parse the
information is presented

654
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,390
I could I'm I tend not to attend a try
not to give advice

655
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,200
on you know I find it if I

656
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,210
if I can structure metaphor that allows
them to take what they need out of it

657
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,390
that's a that's a far better way to to
handle the world

658
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:52,069
thank salute their number croup

659
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:57,030
crew group the programs with the process
of recruiting behavior

660
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,510
wouldn't someone is drawn into them
chanting Colts

661
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,610
werner erhard system the foramen
landmark to keep changing the name but

662
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,390
it's the same

663
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,350
yup same scam on what is the most
effective

664
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,700
we've of dealing with someone that's in
that state because

665
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,140
intelligent people vulnerable to a
creative people tunes and people that

666
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,850
are into

667
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,150
a lot of what were the things and they
can run through a social network well

668
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,840
for

669
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:26,640
usual as a lot of people in wasted
extraordinary amount of time energy and

670
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,319
good what do you do when the you know
from the viewers is only calling

671
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,380
everybody who's phone book is home to
take

672
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:35,640
the next level you know five hundred
dollar training in the whatever

673
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,089
if well I'll tell you and I'm sure I'm
not the only person in this audience who

674
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,170
has this experience I have family
members who have been part of

675
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,790
multi-level marketing impairment schemes
so I don't I don't and I

676
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:50,090
that's where the answer the question
you're asking um

677
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:53,060
I don't think that you can stop someone
from doing something that genuinely

678
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,960
feels a need in their life

679
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,420
you can give them I'm you can structure
thing so that

680
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:03,470
they can best understand but if it's
something that they truly need

681
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,370
for their own growth it's really hard to
pull them out a bit unless you can

682
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,620
substitute

683
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:10,750
on substituted with something out since
like on

684
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,990
you know it's like smoking or whatever
it fills a need for a person

685
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:20,140
and unless you can find a way to give
them another way to meet that need

686
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,180
you're just not going to be able to me I
can

687
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:26,529
come up and talk to me afterwards are on
you a few more

688
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:30,290
concrete things but that's a tougher you
know you can't

689
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:33,900
thats that's why I sorta framed it up
front I'm

690
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,070
hypnosis is in mind control i cant
simply making

691
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,980
stop doing things you've been doing if
you don't really want to do it

692
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,490
I can change it from you know if you
don't wanna change you're not going to

693
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,860
matter what I do

694
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,330
ira I have there's a radio host in the
south of it

695
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:53,230
listen to his podcast sometimes means a
great phrase those convinced against

696
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:53,780
their will

697
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,880
are of the same opinion still

698
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,450
true across olive life matter how
persuasive you are

699
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,320
your hardcore Republican never gonna
change your mind

700
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,990
a home thanks for the talk %uh wanted
share

701
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,980
story and then up please maybe ask you

702
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,600
if you had a recommended list is
interesting stuff

703
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,970
but I'll al-assad ralph nader speak

704
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:26,030
last year for maybe a few years ago I
don't remember but he said something

705
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:26,380
which

706
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,240
I thought was interesting he said the
next time you watch TV

707
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,560
count the number of times the scene
changes in

708
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,850
I think ten seconds so I started doing
that and it was

709
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:40,310
you know a lot of flash flash flash and
it got to the point was difficult to

710
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,900
follow the TV

711
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,700
and like you know I forgot what I was
watching us just kinda seen changing

712
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,430
and after that sup watching TV

713
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,399
and I don't know

714
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,080
and remakes to anything you know some
thank you that was a brilliantly

715
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,270
that was a brilliant story for for
ending this presentation I was awesome

716
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:05,900
yeah any could have asked for a better
if you have any recommended authors said

717
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,440
to learn some I have thousands are
recommended authors on

718
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,210
probably the best place to start and
it's a tough

719
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:18,270
what I'm not on your life

720
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:20,830
I i mentioned there are people out there
who use things for

721
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:25,630
use the stuff for evil on he I I
wouldn't say evil in his case but

722
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,300
financial gain for sure on I would

723
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,950
I would definitely look at the working
american I would definitely look

724
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:38,839
actor man our you know what Robert
shielding is probably the best one

725
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:42,089
it's not specifically an LPN hypnosis
but he did a lot of

726
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:45,830
academic research on influence and how
to have influence on people

727
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,560
and so his work is absolutely brilliant

728
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,589
chill the NEC I A L D I and I just

729
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:59,609
search influence on Amazon will be the
first thing if I yen the same in his

730
00:43:59,609 --> 00:44:01,089
last questioned

731
00:44:01,089 --> 00:44:04,640
not just books but places in general I'm

732
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,368
nations I started with the most
brilliant people I've ever met

733
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:12,000
they were at one point called out be
candid I think they're changing their

734
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,849
name to be

735
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:16,609
to be integrated thinking they've moved
far beyond LP

736
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:20,290
and what you'll find is a lot of people
in NLP

737
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:24,180
on they they took the work that was done

738
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,980
twenty years ago which was interesting
but not particularly progressive

739
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,030
and they're still teaching exactly what
was taught twenty years ago

740
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,080
and that's one other things about family
as well I'm

741
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,830
what you'll find is that there are few
people out there

742
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:43,810
graders doing some interesting work
these days but he's mostly

743
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,630
teaching corporations from what i've
seen but some people who have studied

744
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:51,220
new code NLP and have started moving
beyond that

745
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:54,770
to find new ways %uh influencing world

746
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,200
and I'll be candid as my favorite there

747
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,270
then most incredible blog you should
check it out I think it's LP Canada

between a rock and a hard place double
find something that Milne Ericsson you

763
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:00,900
still up

764
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,880
on a double bind is simply it was
actually a concept created by a

765
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,609
sociologist named Gregory Bateson

766
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:10,450
basin was the first person to ever put
forth a theory of how schizophrenic

767
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:10,900
happen

768
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,540
he said schizophrenia happens when
you're young you're developing and

769
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,770
you're put in a situation

770
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,910
that's called a double by and it simply
this

771
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,940
you're in a relationship you cannot
leave has in with your parents you know

772
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,450
your four you can't pack up and walk
away from home

773
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:30,430
and you're given a choice in which
neither choices except on

774
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,529
in hypnosis we use it often to put you

775
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,540
in a to put you in a situation where you
have to comply for example

776
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,070
you you may not know and you

777
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,099
may not disagree you may not know
exactly which is going to happen

778
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:48,020
but let me ask you a question would you
like to go into a trance now

779
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,400
15 minutes to double by

780
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,190
you either-or and it's a question you
cannot avoid

781
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:00,380
answer you can see neither but the
unconscious doesn't really work

782
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,830
that way its those sorts of double binds
in a in a situation

783
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,390
are are very powerful and it's simply a
communication techniques I'm

784
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:11,520
surrender has done a lot of other work
but he really

785
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,700
you know him better pioneered the use of
that watching Eric centering

786
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,290
so it's like a manager telling me would
you like to stay up all night and finish

787
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,450
that or have it done by tomorrow kind of
things

788
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:25,640
nicely done so is that you have been
reported to the have you

789
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,098
I so would you consider that the evil
side the dark side I

790
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:34,540
no I you know what um so so let me

791
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,589
let me do it this way up

792
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:41,660
well yeah are so

793
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:45,529
so how bout how about a different one
that's a great example but I V

794
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,849
can sever use that one specifically but
on

795
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:54,030
you know I may now that thank you for
that up

796
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,349
I'm trying to figure a great example
where I used 1i can't think oven a good

797
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:59,250
one of the top of my head

798
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:02,420
but I'm you know maybe something like

799
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,319
you know would you like to take the
training course this quarter or next

800
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,310
not giving me the African Union not
giving you the opportunity not to do it

801
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:09,960
right

802
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,089
on I'm I really believe in the growth of
my people when I'm managing

803
00:48:14,089 --> 00:48:18,970
so I often use this to try and get them
to to develop themselves

804
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:22,290
just you know good and evil again

805
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:26,470
have you ever noticed them you to watch
everybody's conversation here to give

806
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,710
knows people getting a higher rating

807
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,390
more success in life one thing I was
thinking letters to the editor

808
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:36,339
to those happy chosen when they're more
in keeping with what you can say

809
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:40,440
I'm I don't know if I would say a higher
rating I can't

810
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,490
and I read letters to the editor try and
stay away from paper generally but

811
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:48,240
on you know the answer is

812
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:52,050
is simply I mean I mentioned it earlier
political speeches really

813
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:56,060
useful to watch because it's really one
of the highest forms are rhetoric in a

814
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,119
society

815
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,660
I'm anti-doping rhetoric in a bad way I
mean rhetoric in the way that played oh

816
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,720
man

817
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,619
you know rhetoric was honored position
in the car in the days in the Greeks

818
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,720
and political speeches is our version of
that and

819
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,950
yeah you see this in political speech
all the time because it's a powerful

820
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:18,330
and and so in terms of people getting
better and better

821
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,310
and more successful in life as they
learn to structure their communication

822
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,259
so people can hear it

823
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,710
absolutely I'm you know you

824
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:28,849
this is a world that relies on
interpersonal relationships and human

825
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:29,619
communication

826
00:49:29,619 --> 00:49:33,230
and the better you get at those things

827
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,319
the more successful your ultimately
going to be is that mean that you do

828
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:36,810
this in

829
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:40,920
instantly become successful no not not
know not in a long shot

830
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,060
means you can you can fail just as
easily as a good communicator as a bad

831
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,730
one

832
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:47,760
but I would say it gives you a better
chance

833
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,109
question dear I'm the people to schools
one hundred be

834
00:49:52,109 --> 00:49:56,970
come political I guess assistance helped
get some elected

835
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:00,330
schooled advertising stuff the for the
creek

836
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:03,348
in these cases no absolutely not I'm
I've never seen anything like this

837
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:04,450
taught in school

838
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,470
I'm I was lucky I went to a

839
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,580
to university that had a rhetoric course
which was interesting

840
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:14,250
but in a lot of in a lot of last week
apartments and drop a rhetoric as

841
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,630
a useful setup tools so I think this

842
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:21,640
I think learning to communicate we were
never really talk how to communicate

843
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,680
you know in grade 12 we learned how to
spell how to write

844
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,098
mean learn what to write in order to
make someone get the point

845
00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:32,260
on and I'm I'm often disturbed by the
fact that we can learn the mechanics of

846
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:34,069
the unit love the way the world works

847
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:37,660
without learning how the world really
works and how to had a really

848
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,920
with an I for

849
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,500
right about the use of the double bond
in relation to fear

850
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,240
appeals relation to what fear appeals

851
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,700
when I mean exploitation of fear yeah I

852
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,440
can I'm you certainly see any synergy

853
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,450
that have any synergy between the two a
it's a communication technique

854
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:04,400
you can you can use it to to appeal the
fear you can use it to appeal to love

855
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:09,290
you can use you know I can use any these
techniques to do

856
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:13,300
on to it and to its about your gender
writes about your intent

857
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,940
if I have a bad intent if I want to
scare you I can scare you whether I'm

858
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,960
good at this or not I can scare you

859
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,950
right on it simply about what you intend

860
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,740
and these are simply tools that make you
better at what you intend

861
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,270
so hopefully I intend everyone out here
has

862
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:33,650
good intentions out to make the world a
better place there are some people who

863
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,230
are

864
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,690
and I yet they could definitely use a
for that

865
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:44,619
some excess yeah

866
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:50,690
all right thing we appear outweigh when
we got one more

867
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,740
yeah as the last one its so my question
is

868
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:58,839
a you mention a lot of the techniques
involve introducing and the beauty and

869
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:03,190
appealing to the unconscious and so what
hope is there for

870
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,830
more rational thought and in the public
sphere

871
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:10,259
and can these tools also

872
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,850
help induce rational thought and
thinking logically instead

873
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:18,490
are based on emotions so I'm I'm all for
rational saw

874
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:23,339
and I'm I am you know I was a philosophy
major and I love computers the

875
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:27,720
as well as the next guy but what I've
noticed is that this is a universe or

876
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:28,650
world

877
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,040
where communication matters more than
the idea we've all

878
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,960
I'm sure been in the discussion where we
knew we had the best idea and we could

879
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,480
prove it

880
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:41,080
but we lost the discussion because the
other person you know was better at

881
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,690
talking

882
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:45,930
anybody who's ever had a discussion long
discussion with the sales person I'm

883
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,960
sure knows what I'm talking about

884
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,299
you know and so yeah I believe that we
should be doing

885
00:52:52,299 --> 00:52:56,310
more things with rational thought but
ultimately this is a world where

886
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:00,009
the better you convince someone that
your ideas right even if your idea is

887
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,770
wrong

888
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:04,630
you usually wear so hopefully the people
who have good ideas

889
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,240
learn to communicate better that's
traditionally not been the case

890
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,540
traditionally

891
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,799
the people with the best ideas are
hidden in some ivory tower unable to

892
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:12,630
communicate

893
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,520
and I would love to see more those
people get out in the world and share

894
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,359
those ideas in a persuasive way

895
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,220
I thanks very much
