48
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:14,730
any that might want to step out because
there will be some language

49
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,239
issues and this I'm sure because that's
one of the great things about

50
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,750
doing an internet radio show one of the
things that we've always been

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,840
when I i've known from day one that this
is the medium in the only medium that we

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,190
can really do something like this not
only for the content of the hacking and

53
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,950
the technology and stuff that goes along
with it

54
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,340
but also because we can speak freely and
say what we want I don't have to deal

55
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,300
with FCC regulations now have to wait
for once every two years to doing in DC

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,290

are out there I'm gonna go through and
bring some

96
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,360
some people up to because the cool thing
about the show

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,900
is that we bring people up there are
knowledgeable in different subjects

98
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,979
about hacking

99
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:55,229
oMG I need to go back let's look back
our FAA again

100
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:00,210
our FAA was om a show that covered a lot
of different things though and if you've

101
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,840
probably seen some the pictures pop-up

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,840
the slogan was technology privacy and
freedom knowledge in she is me for our

103
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,349
knowledge and freedom

104
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:14,380
so and actually racks of course was one
of the founders of that show

105
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,610
so iraq's thank you for helping

106
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,659
get a whole internet packing and John R
it started off

107
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:24,940
you know back with a hacker mine was a
show those on furlough by

108
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,479
while in our FA which I loved and I
became good friends with cooling racks

109
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:33,520
because a the radio show and speaking
other school how is that for perfect

110
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,130
timing

111
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,159
and there's dual an eyelash to at the
home number five arm

112
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,180
where he and I kinda had been friends
from my articles in 2600 from him on the

113
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,979
radio show

114
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:46,110
I supported what he was doing it then
it's a great thing was tryna

115
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,110
started building the show up an I kinda
wanted a little bit more structured

116
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,370
type of show so kind of about half way
through it we decide we kinda branch of

117
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,640
two shows

118
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,650
and a half and that was my lead

119
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,820
photoshop skills you just saw that too
arm with always start a new show that

120
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,909
was

121
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,779
focusing only on the technology only on
the hacking the freaking

122
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,080
some French things like gum urban
exploration

123
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,700
on some any kind in general technology
type topics of it on there okay

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,770
week I had one rule and the rule was no

125
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,950
politics and we've stuck with that from
day one that's one of the things I've

126
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,250
been most proud of

127
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,089
I'm not gonna bash any president's I'm
not going to get up and complaint I'm I

128
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:29,969
complain about the government once in a
while but I'll keep it minimizes

129
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,010
a go of it a little rant the KZN and as
the money shot

130
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,479
say on so will go into in all going to
some ranch and that's why I kinda party

131
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,330
warn you that yet there's gonna be some
language issues that you'll hear once in

132
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,620
a while but it's because

133
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,830
we do have that freedom so

134
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,359
that's now you can add this is the star
of the show home and that is

135
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,909
i guess i I live there's there's no
there was a but there was no T

136
00:07:55,909 --> 00:08:00,130
yet i think is any key unfortunately but
you know but feel free if somebody wants

137
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,479

friendship there and

221
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,480
in the mix on the forms midst a met dual

222
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,300
got together and around episode 25 once
a

223
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,819
I came on really a freak America because
at that time Akram I was gonna go

224
00:12:57,819 --> 00:13:01,870
was kinda teetering it was then it was
going to falter and

225
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,899
just stop space after courting
eventually so

226
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,240
oh well that they'll be missed but I got
on our FAA

227
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,279
I think the first episode we did I it
was a little worried because

228
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,009
wrecks in dule worried deal I didn't
really know them in a while

229
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,800
the know them that well anything but
that but it was cool what we did we

230
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,629
talked about

231
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:24,000
image radios at the time I was really an
amateur radio still am

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,079
I i knows a lot of fun did a little
internet radio making project we talked

233
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,529
to some

234
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,920
different peers around the country and
you know then

235
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,889
pretty soon it turn into a episode 108
show and

236
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,829
do want didn't want to keep going with
it as much so directly

237
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:43,480
well well we'll real-life real life of
course happens a something we've always

238
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,540
said on the show and

239
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,189
it's worth repeating here in front of
everyone live real-life is greater than

240
00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:48,879
acting

241
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,209
you know real life things come first
family taking care of kids

242
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:55,310
getting your job finances and things
like that in order so that always comes

243
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,319
first

244
00:13:56,319 --> 00:14:00,040
are the time that it takes to do a
weekly show like this and some others

245
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,449
are gonna

246
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,980
certainly attest to this in a few
minutes as well on to do it well going

247
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,540
to do it right inconsistently

248
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,129
it's not an easy thing to do especially
when we are so

249
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,740
on we do take a lot of pride and put a
lot of time into doing the research to

250
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,970
getting people on the show to talk about
this particular topics

251
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,199
so well

252
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,170
thank you for adding that it yes you'd
be the expert on their

253
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,540
of turn it back on I am

254
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,589
we started on been Rev radio somewhere
around

255
00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:33,730
I once it was in this seventies sixties
or seventies episodes of our FA

256
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,779
on tool and I had spoken you know it all
on the down low and

257
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:41,490
that he was probably you know is running
at a time do the show regularly so we

258
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,029
kinda took been revving a different
direction and as much as I loved our FA

259
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,029
and I love being on it and actually got
planned on the show

260
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:51,180
and planning to enforce a no one could
make it on but

261
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,920
both great friends of mine so be out
there watching where the cameras that

262
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,750
you know thanks a lot for for hanging in
there and and helping out with a lot of

263
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,079
stuff we've done there there's a really
good friends

264
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,170
arm we kinda all

265
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,420
talked about you know the future the
show in you know maybe she keep are they

266
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,279
going in

267
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,100
and not new host or whatever and I
didn't really feel right about that

268
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,449
because you know that was the show they
created an

269
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,779
how want to go in a different direction
format wise on with Ben Rav

270
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:21,230
on you know and I and I again I talk to
do land and everybody in

271
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,300
everybody's blessings and all that kind
of stuff we continue doing both shows

272
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,120
until

273
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,370
we had a good transition set up but
Wintermute nah I

274
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:32,120
decided that you know where to start
this new show i sat down to write my

275
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,550
show novels as their so accurately
describe

276
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,990
where I get very verbose I type a lot of
fun

277
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,050
started off is what a lot of hacker
shows start off with

278
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,579
now which is a lot of news topics and
opinions thrown in

279
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,129
which we tried to get away from very
early I want to be more educational

280
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:53,170
the shows and actually teach processes
and teach types of hacking

281
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,600
on so we can I went in that direction
pretty quickly

282
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,839
but in the beginning Wintermute nah I
what he would cohost the show together

283
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,129
pretty regularly

284
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:05,279
and then we started kinda mixing in
other people onto the show

285
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,740
so I'll on actually maybe now and

286
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,329
will get slip mode upon the show was
also been doing an internet radio show

287
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:17,110
and have him talk about in the now and
you can attest to what it does take to

288
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,779
do a radio show

289
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:24,009
thank you wanna meet for coming up with
that are

290
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:27,110

291
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:31,129

292
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,300

conference back then and somebody's

293
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,230
pictures I'm sorry some these actual
pictures are from that presentation door

294
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,449
I sell for setting up there

295
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,519
arm so I do show well I did a show I've
done in a while

296
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,399
again it's life but I did about four
years it's called in the now

297
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,529
and I started a little bit before I read
a fic america's unity year before that

298
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:57,740
wanted hacker mind start I start about
2001

299
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,420
yeah so arm I was in Philly with that in
mind at the time

300
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,060
but we were doing a show Nina buddy
mining Dr

301
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,188
and he's just a guy I've known for ever
and we always talked about a lot of very

302
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:12,329
interesting topics I said he when we
talk about it let people listen to it

303
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:12,839
desi

304
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,270
what they field wanna talk about their
and we also include many other

305
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,319
a guess on the show to talk but things
are interested

306
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,949
and those things are obviously you're
concerned with technology

307
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:26,620
you know there's a lot of factors and
things are going on around us in this

308
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,210
world that we don't exactly have control
of

309
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,580
and its impact on our lives in its very
important people stay abreast

310
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,230
know about it we try to do our best to
talk about those things and get out

311
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,800
there and

312
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,050
kinda raise a mental awareness so then I
got people thinking and once you start

313
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:42,430
thinking maybe you could turn into
action

314
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,700
and that's what we tried to do so we did
that show until large unit 2005

315
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,740
and I end up getting really busy

316
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,700
I was going to school was doing show but
I have been really busy and wanna do

317
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,980
take on a project so I wouldn't mind
doing in the future

318
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,630
but things got busy and I hope to do it
again the future but you can always

319
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,470
check it out at

320
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,670
slip net dot org and yeah

321
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:09,130
and I've had been a couple are FAA
besotes I've been on been rather

322
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,460
episode I've been on the phone radio and
if you want to you can you go to sleep

323
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:17,450
net dot org slash files you can check
out the old PowerPoint presentation

324
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,870
which actually talked a lot about all
the shows

325
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,420
ever gone out the time in the talk was
mainly about awareness and

326
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,370
all the people that are out there trying
to spread awareness and the various

327
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,860
methods they're using and how hackers
have

328
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,090
evolve to a next-level love
communicating other than PBS's now it is

329
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,820
open

330
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,450
form in conversation shoutcast mp3 and
all that stuff so

331
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,130
and that's that's a great segue thank
you slip per share gray segue to

332
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,400
a lot of other shows that are out now
and again

333
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,500
download the presentation absolutely got
links to a lot of that stuff

334
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,210
but it actually has kind of snowballed
since then with with been reverie do.

335
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,320
and as you can already tell from the way
the show's going so far I don't have to

336
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,050
do much

337
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:00,080
I mean I get great people to come on and
do the talking and I just am back in

338
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,389
act like I did something so its kind of
snowballed a lot of shows have since

339
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,750
come up so many

340
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,000
and we've always you know I again I
believe very strongly in Internet as

341
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,340
a medium tour to get its kinda far last

342
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,570
and I'm not gonna get us a box of
returning was last place where you can

343
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,290
say

344
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:20,889
whatever you want to say to say fuck
sweatshop pussy whatever you want to say

345
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,980
make up words like I just did you say on
I

346
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,480
proxy agency that sets not cock pussy I
don't know what the fell to seven words

347
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,890
I don't know would you say not only the
language we all do it just because you

348
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:34,610
like to say all I can call us at the F
word you know whatever

349
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,880
but you can actually going to ranch and
talk about things and I don't have to

350
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,270
worry about my show getting taken off
the air I don't have to worry about

351
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,530
losing advertising I make no money

352
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,590
I I'm paying out my nose for this

353
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,610
for the band with for the show arm we
have at our

354
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,470
at our peak had somewhere around seven
or eight thousand downloads of each

355
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,620
weekly shell

356
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,670
saw on a lot of people I hope are are
enjoying showing getting a lot out of it

357
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,660
and um we've been doing it every week we
have never missed an episode

358
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,310
that's a story and I'm sticking to it
there are a couple delayed was are some

359
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,629
technical difficulties along the way but
we for the most part made a shell

360
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,260
and so many shows have also come up
since then many of them that I also

361
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,970
listen to

362
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,850
I love anybody else is out there made by
show of hands I'm I'm a programmer for

363
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,630
living so I sit behind code all day long

364
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,690
and a code monkey ass at their my
headphones and I'll is I need something

365
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,660
to listen to

366
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,230
so we supported want other people to
make shows a something we've always done

367
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,830
I've been on in the now I've been on are
if they have been on all the shows we

368
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,760
all help each other out as a very
supportive community

369
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,690
and that's one of the things I really
want to emphasize isn't a whole lot of

370
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,210
fun

371
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:39,370
oh yeah it's a blast so arm yeah we

372
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,490
we have created one of our site you my
seen the logo or scroll by some point

373
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,020
DTP hack radio all hacking all the time
24 hours it's training

374
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,060
we have actually schedule shows spiner
revolution revolution radio comes out

375
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,190

378
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,340
and we have certain shows answers lots
and the now there's

379
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,600
base net there's ought to several shows
and all scheduling grid and when they're

380
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,810
not playing

381
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:12,500
arm there the last 45 episodes %uh each
show

382
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,220
will be played in reruns of some
speeches some other talk so we can

383
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,620
download put on mp3's

384
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,100
we're working on putting some other
stuff up their content why so

385
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,010
all that out there and not only that but
we have a slight hacker media dock or

386
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,000
which is run by

387
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,340
super group if you saw troops final on
their arm

388
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,350
he's in actually that's ongoing redesign
should be a relaunch that's like

389
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,450
completely sound

390
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,340
and that has some links to several
different technology hacking an hour

391
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:37,740
late

392
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,750
not happy just very all technical
related stuff

393
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,750
arm that might be an interest a hacker
so on Pacha media .org

394
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,020
Andy the heck are you .org if you're
interested you might check those out and

395
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,389
follow up with some los

396
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,560
saw start of the show focusing on
technology we've done

397
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,240
Portland I guess is better to just give
some examples we've done

398
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,080
on episodes on rainbow tables we've done
episodes on

399
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,250
SQL injection we've done episodes on

400
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,310
dot different operating systems
different security tools

401
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,889
I mean we've done a 156 episodes before
now so

402
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,430
anything you might be interested in
we've probably done stately some

403
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,510
I episode on it or will be doing
something on the future

404
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,960
and that's where if anybody wants to be
on the show has something that we've

405
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,820
they think weakness by all means go in
touch with us we'll be glad to put

406
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,070
people on the show

407
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,040
and that's the kinda turn that we've
really taken with the show and season

408
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,680
three

409
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,540
when black ratchet took over sole much
you talk a little bit about what you've

410
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,060
done with Season 3

411
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,350
I did so for season 3 I through black
regulates got

412
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,640
do

413
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,050
arm I remember what was right it was

414
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:51,250
by forced it on you Canadian Forces I'm
here on March um

415
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:55,080
staying you know 'cause me up says hey
you know our real life is rearing its

416
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,689
ugly head would you be interested in
taking over the show

417
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,830
exit me what's wrong with you

418
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,490
a home and I always have little things
cropping up the last minute so I

419
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,260
suggested that are

420
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,480
myself and strong carlson taken over
through

421
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,720
steak was apprehensive about it but we
took it over in a

422
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,780
we took it over and we're in it for you
full season your

423
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,010
three-quarters of season 2i had to rely
rear

424
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,950
real life real life got real-life shook
its little hand in a

425
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:28,330
I got a ring on my finger and I married
now so as

426
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,840
on get I have given up but I had a good
excuse

427
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,840
up God apparently you don't know me

428
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,250
arm so yummy with you

429
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,060
cases to really we kept mostly to the
original format

430
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,580
I'm saying the only thing like three he
said three things you need to do you

431
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,080
need to keep

432
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,580
theme song do the email something else
and I think we did all three

433
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,730
if I i think those the other

434
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,870
arms to those at the outer se Mac time
same bat channel

435
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,500
arm in so well we implemented some
things we actually is

436
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,740
did some live shows in we actually did a
lot of life shows

437
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,300
skewer very both very bad
procrastinators and

438
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,220
it was all it was just it be worked out
for the most part there was

439
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:19,600
every we 10 mister to fire on all
cylinders

440
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,010
rate for the end go figure

441
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,710
everything could have worked out now we
turn it back over stake in seeing took

442
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,760
it over

443
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,770
well I enjoy them I enjoyed myself and

444
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:34,250
much as real-life as real-life and came
in again

445
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,640
on the I took over here towards the end
I was able to get some free time

446
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,200
back again to take over all mister
actually became

447
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,910
mister action and missus ratchet so on
that was very cool

448
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,510
and we I guess I was kinda gonna say the
announcement for the end

449
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,810
but I mean I guess we can go ahead and
say that we are going to continue

450
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,610
there's been rumors that we were gone
and it

451
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,310
with this episode I show and that is not
going to be the case

452
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,409
I have talked with ratchet I talk with
troops

453
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,420
and between the three of us and possibly
some others I'm we all realize the real

454
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,550
life does get in the way

455
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,590
and noms I without going into detail I
travel a lot for work

456
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:16,409
and real life comes in a lot sometimes I
just physically can't really record a

457
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,800
show easily so

458
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,310
between the three of us were gonna keep
the show going or can I can I rotate

459
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,080
maybe a month on a month off or just
fill and whenever somebody else can make

460
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,929

confident we can keep the gauche

can't you see what's on the screen

498
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,910
weighty issue what's on the DVD

499
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:32,160
yeah well and you know it's all

500
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:36,030
it's all because paper on them in addis
introduced us all the cock a

501
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,830
soft act got it right now at its best

502
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,980
no if issue that thing up Ron on the
Internet

503
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:49,990
there there's your problem that's as
close as you can get so actually project

504
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,740
topic project topic for the shows
nothing although prime

505
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,140
in moderation you know that's what that
make me well

506
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,390
every five minutes

507
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,840
yeah exactly that so they make a loop or
time of

508
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,860
sup I well there's one there's one other
show there's one other show I do want to

509
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,700
mention and that's a show that I theory
and I develop

510
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,710
mostly not very I just kinda still
ongoing yep that's cool that's cool

511
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,900
and that show was great factor which was
something else when been read was kinda

512
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,980
taking off

513
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,940
we kinda did you really its it was very
rigid structure it had a set format to

514
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,490
it

515
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:27,310
and we can I wanted something a little
bit more freestyle and

516
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:32,050
I 10 I tend to on the stick to the
hacking topics

517
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,090
I'm not a phone for everything I learned
about freaking is Ben from these guys

518
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,230
which is

519
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,750
a lot from them but you know that's not
my forte so

520
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,230
on one thing I did always I have always
appreciated the freaking

521
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,260
subculture for lack of a better word
that you know the things that freaks

522
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,220
find interesting

523
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,440
Sol freak factor I thought was a great
idea was

524
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,940
when I the world's first and reality
what was it

525
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,630
yeah love world's first internet hacking
reality show

526
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:01,130
and it sounds like somebody over here
has a listen to how many people here

527
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,510
have heard that sell

528
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:07,140
show all I have had your own strengths
test on all the cooking the story but

529
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,930
you listen to free a actor where's

530
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:13,590
that show not there %uh I think I'd lost
it

531
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:20,450
the cookie lady so that leaves we really
have the latest or

532
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,550
quick well it's not that much of a story
I mean I wish I could tell you that I

533
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,919
lay the pipe for some but there's not

534
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,160
that then go that far before I couldn't
live like anybody else would

535
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,770
oh yeah I we did a lot of the times as
great

536
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,620
I know my 2600 meeting I attended in
Fort Lauderdale

537
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,200
had a everything I call it the
everything's a cookie store gonna want

538
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,750
because all they saw was cooking so that
the same girl that always seem to work

539
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,590
in the cookies or every time we had our
meeting so I walk over to the

540
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,370
everything's a cookie store not just

541
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:50,550
Mac on the girl practice by social
engineering skills which is some you

542
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,520
should do any time

543
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,990
a everywhere whatever your no matter who
you're talking to just

544
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,180

practice social and I some over there a

545
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,540

546
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,950

but

547
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:08,220
on after about 2 from two meetings down
there she started the hook me up with a

548
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,220
free cookies and free foods every time I
will go there first thing I go over

549
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,680
there you go guess is a code

550
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,230
so are 2600 meeting always had free
cookies from the

551
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,130
from the everything he wants to sell
when I left when I left the cult hero

552
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,530
was nice enough to make me that cookie
that will probably OK to run again

553
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,899
saying that I was because I was moving
which is why I turn the show over to

554
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,420
black rat so she may be that nice cake
saying goodbye which was very nice for

555
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,000
and then I made yeah the

556
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,440
him specter I did not for the record now

557
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,760
cuz she might national never seen a
slight issue here

558
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,790
cell I'm sorry anyway free factor anyway
free factor

559
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,879
arm yeah we kinda want to do something
free-form like

560
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,250
you guys said it was free free for Tom

561
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,520
we just your weekend is by police
warning called Walmart

562
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,230
PA here well that was kinda the problem
no its cool hormone

563
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,910
58 I have assured writing on the
intercom

564
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,970
yep we want you to come I don't know

565
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,080
freeing up because I think we all have
to do that click

566
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,250
I think we just got hung up on this
awesome I

567
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,350
but for those free

568
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,140
that's getting hard you have a listen to
the show we actually

569
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,500
we it was originally supposed to run
from like nine to midnight or something

570
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,100
you're so yeah

571
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,350
and we were gonna tape it yeah if we let
it run one night to about 5 p.m. because

572
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,740
everyone forgot to shut it off in there
were people on at 5am still trying to

573
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,280
call one of the Walmarts

574
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,460
ho she yeah lol

575
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:49,200
anyway so we did it for a couple of
couple weeks of couples who dis ever

576
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,330
watch it went like

577
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,330
15 12:15 ever so someone that range yeah

578
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,669
24 but the funny thing is at first when
we started doing people like this the

579
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,030
worst show ever

580
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,730
terrible everybody listen closely okay
listen closely

581
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,520
to this party store clerk at last
there's no reason to have it on the air

582
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,120
horrible as efficient as we decided you
know what nobody likes a show

583
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,460
we'll take it all we letter first rate
factors request for you

584
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,140
how much worse call Walmart IAP

585
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,770
cells that's just kind of annoyed we
still get letters about

586
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,129
ahh I don't know hopefully by now it's
tied I miss it

587
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:30,420
personally it now I miss I taught as a
man from new phone we would still have

588
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,110
show if anybody wants to donate

589
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,950
another termination say they don't you
yes and vascular

590
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:44,950
comes for the show will put it back on
line and have the weekly classified

591
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:51,370
there I it's fine by me I think we're
less things are kinda potty mouth

592
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,790
what size mmm

593
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:02,300
that's a good idea I or no work you know
I so I would be the one

594
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:06,750
now would be the one episode that they
don't call Walmart

595
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,830
well let's call righty labeled a Lowes
dude

596
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:13,510
se hacer hackers are the type of people

781
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,390
actually

782
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,490
accomplish stuff it was one of the
things I'm most proud of

783
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:33,760
our meetings that I gave a presentation
earlier today

784
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,110
arm 5 o'clock us some somebody Dom

785
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,520
got stuck because in the plane I a
presentation that I gave

786
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,610
it was something I made up for a meeting
I mean I've got content for our meetings

788
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,200
we work on projects we do programming
together we actually work on

789
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,170
accomplishing something which is really
what binary revolution is all about so I

790
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,070
guess now gonna get on a soap box a
little bit cuz I

791
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:59,330
because I can do that arm by revolution

792
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,549
is kinda over we set out to change the
mindset happen

793
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:06,950
because um hackers for years

794
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:10,200
and I'm not gonna pull any punches ur
kissy ask for anything here but

795
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,720
hackers for years about asphalt each
other they really have

796
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,110
they're all hunter egotistical one up
everybody's trying to outdo

797
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,800
everybody else and we're not we're all
the same people should be on the same

798
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,040
team

799
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,830
we should be working together on were
fighting the mass media

800
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,200
and some other stuff that they do where
fighting against Tom

801
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,350
the the fissures that are out there
they're going call hackers are calling

802
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:34,500
themselves hackers

803
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,260
people out there stealing credit card
numbers and are getting into trouble

804
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,910
committing fraud

805
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:42,040
all kinds of stuff going on out there we
want to get away from that kinda stuff

806
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,369
we should be in fighting with each other
we shouldn't be

807
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:48,860
having this whole thing where all well
my group is better than your group for

808
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,170
my shows better than your show

809
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,290
know we can all coexist so I don't need
to be a whole you know

810
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,990
can we all get along but seriously can
we all get walking along is that really

811
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,840
so hard

812
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,520
the so

813
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,180
finally revolution we started off with
with the radio show informs everything

814
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,359
start of us that dot dot com

815
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,490
which was just my site where I was
headed I've been in 2600

816
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:18,400
and about 10 times or something like
that I don't know I would put the

817
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,530
articles I've written on the site for
people a downloadable forms

818
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:25,810
to discuss some and it kinda sorta
growing I did like the fact it's on my

819
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:26,660
site

820
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:30,460
so and that s actually racks it came up
with the name binary revolution

821
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,690
racks are creative genius up

822
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,930
the revolution will be digitized and
that's what we set out to do is like

823
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,299
we're gonna put everything under been
rather we're gonna try to get the

824
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,170
community back together

825
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:46,300
no more this infighting or if you do
want to get in his in fighting bull shit

826
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,130
you do get into this in-fighting
bullshit get the fuck out

827
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,869
and that's kinda my motto I had this
little hiatus like last year some people

828
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:56,690
know I kinda pulled away cuz I gotta
lotta shit for the way I

829
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:59,790
run things I'm a former Nazi and fascist
and all this stuff

830
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,130
I'm sorry no pussy fuck off you don't
like it fund of is that simple

831
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:06,490
so my know what my whole philosophy now
is snafu

832
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,840
forget to follow staff simple shut the
fuck up

833
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,520
or get the fuck out because the
revolution is going to continue with or

834
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,340
without you

835
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,540
I wanted to be with everybody I want
everybody to be on the same page with

836
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:18,100
this

837
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,030
and I want everybody to participate even
if it's just little things here they're

838
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,560
being on the radio show

839
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,660
writing an article for the magazine we
do have to be a video show

840
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:29,330
we've got all these different things
that we're doing plus will help you

841
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:29,830
promote

842
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:34,730
anything else and this is probably a
good segue right now too

843
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:38,130
it's not just us in our projects and ATP
there so whatever

844
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:41,480
we do a lot of other things for people
that we support

845
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,210
on an axis a segue into our our special
guest tonight

846
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:48,530
arm people that

847
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,880
we all know I'm not gonna go over this
cliche that hacking is about freedom

848
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,810
it's about freedom of information is
about sharing knowledge in sharing

849
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:55,860
things

850
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:59,840
and people that are producing stuff for
the love of it I mean I love

851
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:05,040
hacking I absolutely love hacking we all
know the definition what hacking yes

852
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,110
but its who I am it's what I do with
what all of us do

853
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:13,560
so anybody that has a passion for
something and they're putting it out

854
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,390
there

855
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,480
for the community and sharing and
bringing people together

856
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,940
that's the kind of people that we
support so we host some web sites for

857
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,160
people like that we

858
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,259
assist in other people's projects I go
on other people shows and things like

859
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,180
that

860
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,180
and our special guest tonight who
setting up the audience look around

861
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,509

00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,740
I is somebody that I've been a fan of
for a while

863
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,030
arm I have I i've to

864
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,080
I have a lot of weakness but I have two
glaring weaknesses

865
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,440
took one as art was a cookie lady

866
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,480
could you help one is art I can draw
stick people my stick people are

867
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,100
retarded

868
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,680
they absolutely key I can't even draw
anything I can draw circle

869
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,810
with a compass I can't do anything
artistic

870
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,890
and second I can't do anything musically
I just don't have that

871
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,190
skills are not that good at so I have a
lot of respect for people who can do

872
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,369
those things

873
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:09,080
so some other graphics that you've seen
up there have been from some great

874

all day tomorrow

918
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,600
its a really kind of love the way that
net radio shaping up to

919
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,900
folks who don't have that

920
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:53,880
considered cheesy radio ways cheesy
Radia

921
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,890
personality can for it talk radio
together and have

922
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:02,170
like real interest programming like
people who actually you're interested

923
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:02,670
hacking

924
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,910
talk about hacking every week for a long
time actually pull an interesting show

925
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:07,290
off

926
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,640
I'm into that cares you not just

927
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,020
I mean you're sort of hacking the
industry standard absolutely and the

928
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,570
whole shape

929
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,760
media at that point not to sound
grandiose

930
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,860
well that you're doing a similar thing
with the whole your i mean

931
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,160
independent publishing a music is taken
off for

932
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,799
years now but with the onset of file
sharing and peer to peer as much as they

933
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,230
want out

934
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:31,720
basher that's a very common thing to
hear about on the show the closest thing

935
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,150
will actually get the politics is

936
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,400
talking about something that's often the
freedom of music and people who

937
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,250
you know how was it I mean how do you
you

938
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:43,290
you have to be able to spend a lot of
time to make music

939
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:46,290
I know that I know that how do you pull
it off how do you do that

940
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:50,410
share you know basically anyways ima job
has enough time to make a bunch

941
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:54,149
music pat's that's not so difficult
getting am

942
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:57,360
people to be able to hear it has

943
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:02,760
up until recently just like pay in
everybody's but occurs

944
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,090
you know these companies in they have
two deals with the radio stations in the

945
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,410
mostly have a a lock on which 20

946
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,190
records everything the country gets to
hear every year and that just fell apart

947
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:19,320
and like nasa's twenty how many and what
simpson this aan dat

948
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,890
music's not interesting that everybody
but its interesting a bunch of people

949
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,370
and so it made sense for their

950
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:28,279
business model and now all of a sudden
like anybody's

951
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,070
interested in some weird song about
getting peed on it

952
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:36,200
Star Wars convention and can yeah I know
that about

953
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,700
yeah we didn't earn it buck at anybody
who hears that and thinks that that's

954
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,490
something that their friends would also

955
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,510
fine titillating an amusing can

956
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:50,570
can email that to their friends n just
sort of create a

957
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:53,630
web music distribution themselves

958
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:57,110
that has completely subverts the

959
00:52:57,110 --> 00:53:00,640
music companies at downside being
noticed

960
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,759
pay to receive email my sign it but

961
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,810
that ends up working out anyway because
you build

962
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:10,250
fans who were real fans to get the media
push

963
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:14,280
to them on top-forty earlier who came to
it because

964
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,880
their naturally interested in

965
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,900
being really into it may stop by and
sling

966
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,950
donates money bias year t-shirt on me in
Iraq friends

967
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,390
have been struggling at this for long
time had

968
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,580
told me that the music industry was the
t-shirt business and actually

969
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,910
is true eventually you guys will figure
out how to hacking the

970
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,410
t-shirts & pirate does beef

971
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:44,440
I but for now well and actually there's
a there's a funny joke because we know

972
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,090
you're joking

973
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:48,770
there's a funny joke on the first track
on this album about

974
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:52,600
you're somebody releasing the album on
BitTorrent right

975
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,510
you know it's because this you all you
really you put this stuff

976
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:00,430
actually could be back up did I don't
wanna say cuz I don't know this is true

977
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:01,360
but song fight

978
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,170
was that like the beginning of now as
the those the beginning

979
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:08,540
the Penny Arcade guys heard for science
on fire

980
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:14,029
which is you'll lasers and name linked
to it which promptly Lake District sign

981
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:15,370
for its ability to have

982
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:20,290
connected to their web server and then

983
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:23,960
after that a bunch of people in Herndon
anybody's ever heard

984
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,210
pretty much it's because United pick me
up after seinfeld some faves escaping if

985
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,030
you haven't heard a bit

986
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:34,470
invent song titles and then all these
amateur bands write songs that have that

987
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:38,840
titles every week post like 10 songs
called yellow lasers

988
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,930
the votes on came up with the best song
for that name

989
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:46,130
nobody wins anything it's free I mean

1044
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,450
as music listeners like we've all kind
falling into this

1045
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:01,190
bizarre giant honey pot music appearing
free on your hard drive

1046

1047
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,490
borrowing music even if we buy CDs
afterwards

1048
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:13,640
the jokey for sign that you mention
charity case can address is that it's

1049
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:13,930
like

1050
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:17,520

01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,210
I so long but

1097
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:00,250
really it's not like you're not going
into the store getting rate for 20 bucks

1098
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,620
for the new

1099
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:05,000
why my sister will be out there will be
no rate involved if you buy my record I

1100
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,390
can

1101
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,170
but if you put in a couple almost
guarantee if you put in a couple extra

1102
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,490
box in addis will be around

1103
01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:14,710

if nada gets tired I will step in on
occasion for a break

1105
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:24,550
but others acting like that what do you
guys having is that lemon party picture

1106
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:28,390
up that's kind of hot have that's like
my background on my laptop

1107
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:31,589
actually that was the fuck that was the
funniest episode a freak factor in my

1108
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,150
opinion will recall the internet called
the Internet

1109
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:37,680
and there's a useless anyway well as
website lemme

1110
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:40,170
given the fact French got here there's
not enough he knows the story because

1111
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:43,430
there's a website called call the
internet dot org and it's just a phone

1112
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:45,610
number I don't know there's really any
other content on that

1113
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:49,080
on it so now I just found it and called
it and thought it would be funny so. he

1114
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:49,710
calls it

1115
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:53,270
and you know these guys just like hello
this is the internet so

1116
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:56,750
we have no idea what they're with their
their now I'll

1117
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:01,160
just I had called this number like for
weeks before the show

1118
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,970
and I would just call just to be an ass
to go get the internet slow can you

1119
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,100
reboot deforming

1120
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:08,450
I just had this just just to annoy I'm
just over and over again

1121
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:11,540
and I wish I was just gonna show you see
how long we can track mind

1122
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:15,420
so keep pushing these guys and pushing
and pushing finally ask if they can go

1123
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,240
to you know different web sites and then

1124
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,260
of course lemon party there or comes up
so

1125
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:23,560
because our internet was down so we ask
them to read naturally

1126
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:28,360
briefly have no access to 11 I the cut
and sew dynamic we want to know it was

1127
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,570
there

1128
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,120
so I we mention the site

1129
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,589
and there's a pause and then all the
sudden without really missing

1130
01:02:36,590 --> 01:02:39,600
too much for be the guys as well there's
three elderly gentleman

01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:48,120
it was great there these guys were the
greatest sports they were so cool to

1133
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,359
play along if for some reason they see
this there was a really fun

1134
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:54,540
I was cracking up laughing and I was
definitely the best as they that I was

1135
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,880

1144
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:27,950
some I mentioned earlier like tom you've
done the collaboration with compressor

1145
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:31,160

1151
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:52,950
and he'd in the whole time we did the
collaboration

1152
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,050
he would not break character on
compressor all the

1153
01:03:56,050 --> 01:04:00,780
emails like all caps no punctuation make

1154

away from happening

1164
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:39,250
