1
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,220
all right we're gonna get started with
the next panel its how to steal

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,270
someone's implanted RFID and why you'd
want to

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,119
on it is hosted by number twenty six in
number 68

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,420
number 26 is

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,480
renew its who has been a previous
conferences

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,260
used to work for the FF now works for
wired and Jonathan West you so I met

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,930
three minutes ago

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,040
%ah and Lee has an RFID chip on
implanted inner

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,150
so when she goes to EZ Pass he gets
charged twice I'm

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,649
so without further ado on

11
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,290
my on okay actually stars3 the past it's
a totally different frequency

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,550
maybe in the future on

13
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,969
okay so basically what we're going to do
here

14
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:06,770
is I'm to talk a little bit about why I
got RFID implanted in my arm

15
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,360
and Jonathan what's used to work said
merle

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,690
is an amazing hardware hacker is going
to talk about his device

17
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,990
approx mark 3 which to use to clone

18
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,399
my implant RFID to my knowledge this is
the first time

19
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,880
somebody's actually cloned and implant
ideal is certainly not the first time

20
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,390
RFID has been cloned RFID for those who
don't know I was told that

21
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:36,240
audience might understand acronyms is
radio frequency identify remember that

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,280
never gonna tell you can

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,159
so basically the question why

24
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,890
why how did I get this RFID implants
tell you a little bit about

25
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,840
win I to help people have an RFID

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,409
my body there's usually an on
interesting question

27
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,570
that comes after that which is why would
you do that I'm interested in that

28
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,659
question at all

29
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,860
I think that our fight these are going
to become more and more ubiquitous

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,449
I don't think it really matters why I
chose to do it what really does matter

31
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,828
is why I chose to get this particular

32
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:16,250
kinda RFID implant in my arm there are a
wide

33
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,750
range RFID you can use their small
communities on

34
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,680
the internet devoted to you people
talking about this their spokes

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,099
done all kinds experiments with their
plans RFID so the question is

36
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:32,069
wide pic and RFID which is

37
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:35,480
a proprietary spec which is not

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,510
really interoperable with any of the
self readers

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,500
and which is therefore

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,200
not terribly useful so that's the
question I'm going to answer

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,580
today I just want to start briefly by

42
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,840
running you through a very quick history

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,050
implanted are ID's RFID technologies

44
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,840
argue arguably been around in some form
since the nineteen fifties and sixties

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,300
on it really was commercialized until
the nineteen eighties

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,890
and then you didn't really see it being
used very often until the nineties which

47
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,530
is right around the time that

48
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,540
company started marketing implantable
are ID's for pets

49
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,760
and farm animals I'm now a lot of times
when you adopt a cat or a dog

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,140
or a Mouser for durable or something

51
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:28,310
you're given the option to get your pet
tag usually it's not called

52
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,420
RFID they usually say it's and under the
skin

53
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,159
chip or something like that but what is
basically just

54
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,400
implantable RFID exactly like the one
that I have in my body right now so I am

55
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,489
implanted Pat

56
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,379
jonathan is never never tires of
pointing that out to me

57
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:49,149
and he'll talk some more about that but
so

58
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,220
basically RFID that's implanted

59
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,879
is 8 ship and 10 inside

60
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:00,049
doped glass so its surgical it's usually

61
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,920
I depending on the animal that's being
implanted it could be quite big like

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,010
how it might be about this big decisive
it to me if you're from Canada

63
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,220
besides a 50-cent piece if you're from
america

64
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,739
I'm and or it might be the size the one

65
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:18,750
which is basically they always say the
size of a grain

66
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,089
rights I'm was in the late 90's that
artist

67
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,419
Eduardo cots and the site work professor

68
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:30,729
Kevin Warrick did the first public
experiments with human implantation

69
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,050
are ID's I think they basically use Pat
are

70
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,210
ID's which had by that point been proven
to be quite safe

71
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,669
on they don't tend to migrate under your
skin so there

72
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:45,740
pretty good that way really tend to
develop too much scar tissue either

73
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,470
on in 2000-2001

74
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,630
company called applied digital announced
that it would be marketing

75
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,949
not just implantable RFID sphere cuddly
dog but also for people

76
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,440
immediately there was public outrage
over it and pundits were saying

77
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,460
oh my god that means we're going to be
tracked gonna be just like 1984

78
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,479
and so far that hasn't quite come to
pass

79
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:16,669
but VeriChip which is a division of
Applied

80
00:05:16,669 --> 00:05:20,990
that markets chips for humans I'm has in
fact been making

81
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,360
some inroads into you getting their
chips fairly

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,500
wide me well it's a

83
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,300
fairly widely early-stage deployed which
is to say

84
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,080
there in their their testing these our
fight you human implantable RFID

85
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,560
he's in several different markets 1
which was

86
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,590
around 2,000 their marketing Latin
America to prevent

87
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,630
people from being kidnapped which
Jonathan night before the stock were

88
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,320
discussing

89
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,389
like how exactly that would prevent
kidnapping we weren't really sure

90
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,060
you know yeah after I so I I said it was
too

91
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,610
to prevent you know someone from you
know growing and cloning

92
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,400
view and replacing you or something like
that but anyway so that

93
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,650
apparently marketing didn't work so now
they're being marketed

94
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,669
I am not just as I'm

95
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:15,990
kidnapping prevention devices but as
medical devices basically implantable

96
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:16,789
medical

97
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:20,130
ID tags I'm and a

98
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,430
that's very tip is focusing on now other
also as we'll get to in a second

99
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,380
focusing on the most access control
devices which is to say basically

100
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,270
implanted smart cards

101
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,690
um there was a lot of media attention in
2004

102
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,120
win VeriChip got FDA approval for its
device

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,410
%uh there's a widespread
misunderstanding that what that means is

104
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,509
that it's the only

105
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,270
chip approved for human implantation
that's not true

106
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,240
the only reason why they got FDA
approval with because they wanted to use

107
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,490
it

108
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,930
in a medical capacity so it's the only
RFID thats implantable it's approved for

109
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,169
medical use

110
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:56,370
I but there's a wide range other kinds
our fight is that you can use for

111
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,710
implantation

112
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,630
I am so let me so I got VeriChip

113
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,680
and I'll talk to you a little bit about
why that is in a second but let me tell

114
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,610
you first

115
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:08,389
a few things about the ferrets happened
and Jonathan will get into more

116
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,000
technical details later

117
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,729
on the basically it's a pretty typical
low-frequency chip

118
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:17,960
it's a 134 killer hurts which is kind in
the rains have a lot of

119
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,470
on like that procs cards

120
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,259
I it contains the 16 digit read-only ID
number

121
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,960
common it's a passive RFID which means
it doesn't have its own power source so

122
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,430
it's powered by a reader

123
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,639
I'm in the read range is really really
small

124
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,009
I which is to say it's not likely that
someone could even read it

125
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:42,229
say a foot away but I'm I think that
they can get close enough that cloning

126
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:42,539
them

127
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:46,469
is quite possible in fact we've proven
that

128
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,240
one of the reasons I got the ferrets
have I don't know if

129
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,740
well people will be able to read this
what are the reasons I got it was

130
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,900
because the company with

131
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,150
marketing them of falsely as it turned
out

132
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,729
as the perfect access control device
this is from their website I copied this

133
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:05,389
a couple days ago so shockingly they
still have it on their website despite

134
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:06,440
the fact that

135
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,039
both Jonathan and I have published
articles are talking about

136
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,599
the fact that they're lying um but they
say here

137
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,669
on their website unlike conventional
forms of identification

138
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,979
the VeriChip cannot be lost stolen
misplaced or counterfeited

139
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:26,878
it is safe secure reversible and always
with you and with the fuck reverse

140
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,069
means for civil I you if you turn your
skin inside out our

141
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:34,729
I'm anyway %uh but the thing that I
really focused on here was the idea that

142
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:36,400
it couldn't be counterfeited

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,809
on at the time I was researching at the
time I read this I was researching an

144
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,660
article for wired magazine which has
since come out

145
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,140
about security in our fight ease and
I've been reading

146
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,300
jonathan's work as well as the work have

147
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,880
I some folks at johns hopkins who had
been working on cloning and skimming

148
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,180
approx cards as well as on the Exxon
Mobil Fast Pass

149
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:01,529
on it some other RFID devices and all of
them had

150
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,760
shown basically it's quite simple to
clone an RFID

151
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,490
I and I said to myself well can it be
either VeriChip has invented

152
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,160
a foolproof non clonal RFID that's going
to be implanted under my skin

153
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,719
or under anyone's skin you know as a
good investigative journalist

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,620
I need to find out more arm so

155
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,740
I set out to get VeriChip implant

156
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,720
and I contacted Jonathan asked him if I
got one would he be willing to try

157
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,170
cloning and he said

158
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,329
yeah even though it's kinda boring to
clone a pet

159
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,959
I her pet I T and then use we was
willing to do it which is very kind of

160
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:39,610
him

161
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm so let me tell you a little bit
about the process of getting VeriChip to

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,170
give me an implant which was

163
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,519
which is a story a which is very arm
amusing and tells you a lot about their

164
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,990
business practices

165
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,760
VeriChip claims that they have about two
dozen

166
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,500
doctors who are I'm somehow affiliated
with the company and have been trained

167
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,660
to do these implants the implant process
is quite simple assault on a second

168
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,910
and so I looked through their list up
doctors who had been trained

169
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,350
I found one Alan Pantac who is a really
nice guy works at UCLA Medical Center

170
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,430
on and call them up and I said hey you
know I'd like to get one of these

171
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,510
implants can be set me up and he said

172
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,779
what do you what he's talking about it
I'm not approved to do

173
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,640
fair to pinpoint what was and I said
well but your your list to hear on

174
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,500
on the virtual website as an approved
doctor and have your name and address

175
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,370
and phone number right here he says

176
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,940
well it's true that I once went to their
website and

177
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,370
I did register for the Web Site and did
mention I was a doctor

178
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,649
am her you

179
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:43,880
and and I said well apparently you're
proved so

180
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,380
do you have some chips can you hook me
up and he said %uh no

181
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,550
I'm but I sure if you want me to stick
10 I'll do it no problem

182
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,070
and it turned out he I'm had actually RT
done the implant for Mikey Sklar

183
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,130
who you might have heard every does the

184
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,510
Faraday cage pants and lots of other
interesting Atrix

185
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,010
RFID so he was happy to do it am so I
contacted there too but I said hey come

186
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,779
on

187
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:11,200
get this guy you keep this guys on your
website as an approved vendor so you

188
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,390
should give him a ticket to implant

189
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,579
the staff and they hand in hot for a
couple of months

190
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,240
and so finally the day that I had booked
my tickets a good and LA to get the

191
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,019
implant

192
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:24,570
they literally had just FedExed the
equipment to him

193
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,200
that morning so his entire training

194
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,769
in getting a fair to implant was
receiving the box about two minutes

195
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,890
before he did the procedure

196
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,649
on this isn't me getting a procedure I
haven't actually had a sex change since

197
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:41,029
since getting my parents have I'm but
this is

198
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:44,570
this is exactly what happens on they're
all their tix are supposed to be

199
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,450
implanted in your

200
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,920
arm so the idea so that when hospitals
bring UN in your unconscious they know

201
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,420
where to look for it

202
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,019
I'm the user bit LY two came to numb
your skin

203
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:58,110
and a cannulated needle which is just a
needle that's hollowed-out

204
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,519
and they stick the chip which is about
the size I have they always say a grain

205
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,050
of rice

206
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,450
and indeed it is the size and grain rice
and they just

207
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:09,500
shootin' and it didn't really hurt
partly cuz I was numb

208
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,320
but I didn't bleed it was very easy

209
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,339
I went home with abandon comin now I
have a number

210
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:21,880
and there's my my ID number so if you
want to steal my identity

211
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,450
feel free all but in fact as you'll find
out

212
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm it's quite he's got my actual arm
and that's the actual band-aid I went

213
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,529
home with

214
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,120
am and E as you'll find out

215
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,820
someone when Jonathan I'm clones might
ship in a few minutes

216
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,610
am one of the things about the VeriChip
this allegedly non counterfeit a ball

217
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,970
completely secure

218
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,389
access device on is it has absolutely no
security controls on it whatsoever

219
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:52,420
I so it's basically just a

220
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,920
ID number being sent in the clear
fantastic for a walk

221
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,760
fantastic for a lock that it for a key
that is now stuck in your arm for ever

222
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,870
on the process of getting the RFID

223
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:06,889
out if your arm is actually really
painful and sake

224
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,930
so I probably won't actually ever

225
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,200
take it out I'm you know they stick it
in with the needle

226
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,990
but then in order to get out the kinda
have to cut you open in like dig around

227
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,589
cuz it's really small you can like
barely feel it

228
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,470
if you what's the boys like my touch my
arm so I can I feel it but

229
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,399
you can't really so I'm so I'm not gonna
get taken out cuz I don't

230
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,170
care that much arm and I don't want them
kinda digging around in my arms anyway

231
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,880
I just want to mention briefly before we
goats the demo

232
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,439
a couple objections that are often
raised to RFID isn't specifically to

233
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,389
implantable RFID switch I think

234
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:44,630
for good reason really pence people's
buttons and

235
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,850
kinda phrase even more alarm I

236
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,910
you more even greater sense of alarm
then I think RFID is in close for

237
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,990
example or in other devices

238
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,079
so the first question always raised is

239
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:00,100
are RFID is an invasion of privacy and I
think

240
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,360
yes they can be and that's certainly a
good question to ask

241
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
but a more important question to ask is
what kinds of security

242
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,269
are is available on the RFID that we're
talking about

243
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,310
and how much the user has control over
that security

244
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:20,690
and so what I urged people to do who are
experimenting with RFID ease and who are

245
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,970
lobbying for laws that regulate RFID is
in her interested in the technology

246
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,920
is not to pose questions about privacy
because of the answer to the question

247
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,620
about privacy is

248
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,959
yes their privacy invasive we should get
rid of RFID is

249
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,279
well that's not going to happen we're
not going to get rid of them there's

250
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,430
too much money invested in them wal-mart
alone which is

251
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,260
has like the GDP it like a small country
I is now deploying

252
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,300
our bodies throughout its a supply chain

253
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,720
so you're never going to get rid of them
but what we can do

254
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,449
is push companies and push governments
to create our fight is that have decent

255
00:14:55,449 --> 00:14:57,490
security controls on them

256
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,880
and there's all different ways in which
that might happen you might get

257
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,540
chips with really strong crypto on them
for things like

258
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,819
arm car keys I where you really want to
make sure that someone can clone it

259
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,060
or you might have something as simple as
if you're using EPC to attack in it

260
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,720
piece of clothing make it so that
someone can cut it with scissors put it

261
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,529
into the

262
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:22,260
tax so that someone has control over
what happens to that

263
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,439
RFID tag and label anything that has an
RFID tag on it

264
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,350
I'm so that's really where I think we
should be pushing is not pushing to get

265
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,579
rid of our fight is

266
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:34,350
the pushing to have better security
under the user's control

267
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,600
on the other question I get asked a lot
and was asked when I went on Democracy

268
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,860
Now with I was mcintyre the

269
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,199
very friendly but a little bit alarmist
author of spite ships

270
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,399
I'm was a special additional spy tips
just for Christians

271
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,220
um a you know the the radio host ask

272
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,690
what what Hitler have done with RFID is

273
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,889
I'm well be answer is the exact same
thing he did without

274
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:04,209
RFID is I I don't think that genocidal
dictator Zine need RFID is in order to

275
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,660
kill minority groups

276
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,329
history has shown us that genocide can
work just fine and extremely analog

277
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:11,610
low-tech environment

278
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,279
so I really think that when that
question gets raised really just has to

279
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:15,829
be

280
00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:19,079
kinda dismissed and and say like look
that's not the issue really the issue

281
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,070
here is

282
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,470
user control security I also

283
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,959
I just to finish up a few examples of
people who I think have been doing

284
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:31,269
interesting experiments with implanted
ID RFID is

285
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:35,560
I'm who are sort of taking this idea
have challenging the security of our

286
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,519
fight he's in publishing about it

287
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,589
on there's a Marg rostra I whose book
RFID tricks is really fine he has

288
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:46,920
to implant RFID is I wanna have them
which is pictured here in this lifetime

289
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,620
sighing

290
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,750
on the Philips high-tech as 2048 ship

291
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,750
does have some shit security functions
and he's playing around with that in

292
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,339
writing about it right now

293
00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,019
I'm has a great website another type of
experiment that's being done with RFID

294
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,170
is is using them in art

295
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,389
Mikey Sklar who mentioned earlier who
created the Faraday cage pants were if

296
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:08,079
you put anything in the pocket

297
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,688
I'm it blocks people's ability to read
RFID marked items

298
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,760
I'm in your pocket I'm has also created

299
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,349
I something called the highlighter
project which is a trampoline

300
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,948
thats activated by the RFID in your hand

301
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,890
and what not trampoline but the giant
flame of fire that's then

302
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:29,260
activated by trampoline see activate the
fire

303
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,520
RFID when you get on trampoline and hire
you down

304
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,129
the bigger the fire am so any rate he's
been building

305
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:40,220
RFID reading into his art for a long
time in he's always at Burning Man so if

306
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,940
you go to Burning Man you see

307
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,190
a flaming trampoline thing that's mighty

308
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,929
I'm however are and experimentation
aside

309
00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:54,289
other thought i won end with is yeah if
we continue down this path with

310
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,750
companies like VeriChip

311
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,650
lying to people about the security if
there are fighting the products

312
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,429
and I government trying to you and put
our fight to use that are not secure

313
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:09,080
into ID tags I'm you know that's the
time when we need to take matters into

314
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,710
our own hands and start packing the shit
outta this stuff

315
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,490
publishing about it I am so thank you

316
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:20,010
um but I would think you know we want to
cheer her for hacking but that's okay

317
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,990
on I hate people who are like two more
now okay

318
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,919
RA air an early morning her afternoon
share for hacking

319
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,880
so the thought I won in with is you know
when you see these kinds of things going

320
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,710
on with

321
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,030
our fate is being presented that don't
have adequate security and that's not

322
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,360
under your control

323
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,570
it's time to start packing in your
garage and or

324
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,460
in your workshop and so with no further
ado I will segue to

325
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,460
the awesome hacker Jonathan West use

326
00:18:59,190 --> 00:18:59,440
I

327
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,240
yeah so I'm going to be talking about

328
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,380
the technical aspect the best om

329
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,490
this is going to be less impressive then
you might

330
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,780
think om so

331
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,110
RFID is used commercially Lakers is a
branding thing is

332
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,040
and as a marketing thing for a lot
deferring

333
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,230
technologies for the purpose

334
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,110
other this presentation I'm going to use
the word RFID

335
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,940
to mean passive RFID that is to say

336
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,150
some little device that communicates
over

337
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,930
but also is Howard over the air on

338
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:45,380
so thermodynamics teaches ass that there
is a deep connection between

339
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,590
energy information if you want to
transmit information

340
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,230
then you do that with some amount of
energy so when your cell phone

341
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,770
transmit you know it it's 4.61 five more
seconds

342
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,350
love your voice over the air it does
that by taking some energy out the

343
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,640
battery putting it in the end hands on
the back

344
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,950
goes into the antenna at the base
station

345
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,580
and your voice comes along for the ride
by

346
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,610
you can also send energy

347
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:17,380
over-the-air just for the sake energy an
example of that

348
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,550
would-be I microwave oven yet operates
at the same frequency

349
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,510
as your wireless land card by the
accident different

350
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,970
so with this is the same

351
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,590
sort of track that is hold by a passive
are

352
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,870
IT tech some the energy that

353
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:39,570
is sent over the air is used to
represent

354
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,370
information for example the reader is
requesting specific

355
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,130
page memory from the tag but some other
also just goes to power the day

356
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:53,630
and then the hey makes its the sea bass
and it runs a little microprocessor

357
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:56,920
the same as it would if that energy came
out of the battery

358
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,300
so this is not new om

359
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,030
Maxwell would have understood

360
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,200
the fundamentals at least up a system
like

361
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,870
that s practical implementations of
course had to wait

362
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:15,800
Intel week could bill meaningful radio
frequency electron

363
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,300
X he ball an early example

364
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,300
are ID was conceived I love

365
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,450
by none other than thurman I'll
electronic music

366
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,700
pain on in 1946

367
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,390
the ambassador her some high-ranking
diplomat

368
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:38,720
I love the United States to Russia was
presented with a carved Great Seal

369
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,980
I love the United States out but by
schoolchildren

370
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,340
I'm very good and it was a nice car I

371
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,379
seen pictures it's beautiful and and you
know that the

372
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,940
ambassador can also recognize good wood
carving

373
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,230
when he sees it so you know sweetie for
bob seems okay

374
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,340
and and hang it up in your office I

375
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,800
wasn't Intel 6 series leader

376
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,550
that they happened to disassemble it and
find inside

377
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,629
at and antenna and a microphone

378
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,280
but nothing else so works by the same

379
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,930
prints for rightly you the take Katie be
parked the van outside

380
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:21,010
e-beam 350 megahertz in the window

381
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:24,510
and you listen for the Voice

382
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,510
on the backscattered radio camp

383
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,690
it's an RFID back and in this in the
days a vacuum tubes

384
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,960
obviously we've come a long way since

385
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,310
that the development

386
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,450
%uh modern integrated circuits modern
transistors

387
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,980
modern I see processes has made this
practical

388
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,810
so for you know the past 28 years

389
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,399
you've been able to buy relatively
simple

390
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,450
RFID tags these tags don't perform any
kind mathematical operation

391
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,130
on the tag itself no crypto on

392
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:08,310
no fancy state machines basically have
some mighty

393
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,840
it's a fixed number bets usually on the
order a hundred

394
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,370
when they're in the field the repeated
over and over and over

395
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,260
and and that's it but this is good for a
number of things

396
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,410
om the majority of proximity cards

397
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,750
on marked for example work

398
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,010
and this way and you've been able to buy

399
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,470
parts arm that are more or less like

400
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,980
this in a number of different packages
as well

401
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,680
you can get him as a flat proximity card
you can get them

402
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,220
as like little this keep things discreet
is something and you can get

403
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,040
them as class encapsulated things

404
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,120
for use in harsh environments where

405
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,730
rebel they will get wet or exposed to
solvents or whatever

406
00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,020
on cell you know given

407
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,320
some pieces human or animal flash and
given

408
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,850
this RFID tags chieftain biocompatible

409
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,390
class I mean it doesn't take very long
to figure out that yes you can probably

410
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,520
I this in into that and nothing bad will
happen afterwards

411
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,110
and the RFID tag will continue to work
and

412
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:24,960
you know I have implantable RFID and and
people have done this in animals

413
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,100
for a while that this isn't a great
innovation

414
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,190
the basically taken yet another RFID tag

415
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,140
the same as your Motorola Flex Pass
proximity card

416
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:40,430
or are the same as you know some sort of
ill

417
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,270
faded asset tracking thing and

418
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,330
the have implanted instead into your
house

419
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:50,510
that's okay now you can return your
house had

420
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,670
Tintin you know someone can return it
when it gets lost and

421
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:57,910
can't get lost like a collar way den
that's not a bad idea

422
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,000
fairly practical

423
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,060
but of course you know humans or animals
to so with this product's

424
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:11,220
on mark at that there are ready
basically designed for animal use

425
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,830
I mean it it's not a really great week
to think that yes you could implant

426
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,460
this into humans as well

427
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,790
arm is so people have done us om

428
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,170
anally of course ran through the first
few people have done it but I mean

429
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,190
these days you're just not a credible
futurist without at least one of them

430
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:31,980
implanted

431
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,360
arm so that that there's a lot of people
out there with

432
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,220
at show of hands are lol

433
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,860
arm no one in this room has an RFID
implant

434
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:50,300
how do people in the room know somebody
has an RFID implant

435
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,770
you

436
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,990
it cost me about four hundred dollars to
get mine done but that's cuz I got it

437
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,830
done it at medical centers so I think
people are

438
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:03,800
I mean it's 20 bucks for a chat for one
that has good crack down for

439
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,280
a crappy ones like five bucks oh yeah
and I'm the medical

440
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,270
portion of it this isn't like the latest
in biotech

441
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:15,180
communicate piercing artist can do this
for you with no trouble are

442
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,030
it's not that exciting arms

443
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,690
so people have done this to the
attention seekers the artists that the

444
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,510
whatevers

445
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:28,540
and you know like if you want to do
something that will cause the reporters

446
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,730
to return your calls and you want you

447
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,450
involve RFID and you want to do this
knowing as little about

448
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,920
RFID is possible then getting yourself
implanted is actually pretty

449
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,920
that mu I mean I can't think of anything
better

450
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,220
so people have done s arm

451
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,420
and very chip has done this as well

452
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,320
so so I think that the latest trend for
the individual experimenters

453
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,490
is T you say there's this one web store
that sells have it altman cat

454
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,940
on it is like a few hundred boxing get
yourself started

455
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,780
then you know you get your plastic
surgeon are you get your

456
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:07,790
piercing artist or you can even do it
yourself i've seen but pages from people

457
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,830
dead and took pictures

458
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,980
by it's not that hard

459
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,100
inferior chips case their parent company
makes pack tax

460
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,320
so you can kind of gas by aidid righty

461
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,780
well it worked in the cab cell but
stride

462
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,240
in a person and of course it worked

463
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,500
arm it's a very rational thing to do

464
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:37,280
if you take very chip though and you go
to read it

465
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,360
with AP K greeter

466
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,620
that then I'm told I haven't tried that
won't read and similarly if you take

467
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:48,040
a pet K an you do it the other way

468
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,290
that then it won't read but that's very
easy to do without

469
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:56,240
incurring any major new development
expenses

470
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,450
the hey just repeats and I D some

471
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,340
bitstream out of memory it doesn't
really know which of those bets are the

472
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,680
CAC summer which of them are the Hatter
and so wanted to just mess with the

473
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,310
format a little that

474
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:13,020
no new development expenses but you have
whole

475
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,120
new seeming family if tax so this is
cheaply

476
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,350
like we're talking you know low six
figures high five figures

477
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:26,180
I mean if you can set yourself up in the
highly professional human implantable

478
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,240
RFID business

479
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,570
for you know a fraction of the cost
house in Boston

480
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,679
to you do you want to just point out we
we actually

481
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,720
deck around a little bit not proof that
ferrets if does indeed

482
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,660
have a parent company called digital
angel that produces pet tags

483
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:46,890
so this is digital angel and here's an
article from 2000

484
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,180
where digital angel talked about getting
a

485
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,500
an implant not just for keeping tabs on
pets for worldwide use in tracking human

486
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,270
beings

487
00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:00,050
so they don't talk about that now but
indeed history does so that

488
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:04,090
pet taxing human tax at the same yep
pretty much

489
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,150
om that their chips business model is

490
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:11,690
not really product design by product
repurpose Inc

491
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,210
the the IP that is been developed

492
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,820
for use in-house an they apply to people

493
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,389
and when I say the the IP I mean the he

494
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,890
the same like piece of silicon the
reason you know no new chip

495
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:31,750
beam design their theories no expensive
development

496
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,370
it's not effectively apec their
implanting

497
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,200
in your it's not like something the
tracks use it for a pet tag it's the

498
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,970
same part number

499
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,370
its apec

500
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:47,400
and yes that they're doing and I P O
really

501
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,830
forty-something million dollars but

502
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,330
the problem of course with this

503
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,129
is that I am now I'm supposed to talk
about security

504
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,950
by if you're designing a product
yourself then you can design the

505
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,110
security

506
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,210
but if you re purposed Singh a product

507
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,370
then the security just happen CE
supportive

508
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,690
gap whatever the designer the original
product seem to think would be useful in

509
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,750
his application

510
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,490
so for apec that there's just no need
for any kind of security

511
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,390
annually in months you imagine some sort
of problem with counterfeit

512
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,920
house pacts there's just no conceivable

513
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,600
way that you can justify the expense

514
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,750
an adding cryptographic security to the
product

515
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,020
but now very tip comes along okay let's
use in people well

516
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,080
now it's implanted in people they do
with that what to do with the pets don't

517
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,460
do well pets don't buy

518
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,500
thinks people by thanks arm so cable

519
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:55,860
make a payment system out of it so so
you can you know walk into a bar you can

520
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,390
you know you know scan your hand or your
armor wherever it's implanted in and you

521
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,200
can buy yourself a drink with that

522
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,960
well okay but at this point

523
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,550
you know before okay you could clone
someone's house back to you could still

524
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:09,810
there

525
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,970
happen replace it with an exact replica
without performing surgery on the

526
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:14,750
original

527
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,820
act not a problem

528
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,330
but you know I'm imagine some sort is a
dystopian future where we all get the

529
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,699
things implanted at birth

530
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,990
and and we use them to buy our groceries
each week

531
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:30,020
on back case I could push through a
subway car with

532
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,580
handheld reader and I could steel

533
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,669
effectively of you doesn't people's
identities

534
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,810
ago this is so it obviously breaks down
completely

535
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:45,139
arm if you read very chip's website they
have quite grandiose

536
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,810
future plans %ah they talk about

537
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:54,010
well using it to make purchases as I
said they also talk about various

538
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:57,120
%ah last specified

539
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,400
things they want to stick them into all
immigrants they want to stick them into

540
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,060
soldiers

541
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,330
at the soldiers is particularly good
like I mean

542
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,340
you know a machine-readable hey

543
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:11,390
that distinguishes your personal from
there's

544
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:15,370
that's gonna be really useful to city
you know the iraqi designers

545
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:20,440
mines right okay okay so now you're
going to say no no the read range isn't

546
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,179
long enough

547
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,929
for that happen well okay if the read
range isn't long enough

548
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:29,370
for that and why is it useful and you
can play these games

549
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:34,530
but I'm I mean the technology is just
absent its apec

550
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,040
it's an RFID chip that could have been
design

551
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,090
when I was in elementary school silty

552
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:45,360
you know him imagined very true at least
is going

553
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,800
anywhere with human implantable RFID

554
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,660
is technically I think a bit nervous
track

555
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,620
sheesh arm I mean it doesn't have to be
that way

556
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:01,550
pp people do all sorts of interesting
things involving implantable RFID

557
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:06,740
like if you drop by a biotech lab you'll
see for example various bits

558
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,660
monitor equipment that they stop in to
lab animals

559
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,810
those things are huge like it's it's
amazing how much you can fit into a

560
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,240
mouse and still have

561
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,880
from left for the mouse but well but lab
animals don't live that long anyways so

562
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,310
but you know you can get things monitor
various vital signs

563
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,300
breathing core temperature

564
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,010
a lot of things on because you know
there's people putting serious

565
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,140
technical effort into designing a
product to solve a problem

566
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:39,700
in the case in the very kept you're
you're just sort of

567
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,000
haiku all weekend we can stick it into a
person instead

568
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,040
so nothing particularly special happens

569
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,379
home so now do the demo because everyone
likes it down

570
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:00,300
yes cell let us switch laptops

571
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,460
now you'll get to see Jonathan

572
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,890
clone my a ship

573
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,179
this print this experiment was
originally originally took place in a

574
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,590
small coffee shop in Cambridge

575
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,620
which has since gone out of business
someone else really lousy by Apple the

576
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,040
yeah I thought the french fries and
coffee idea is a good

577
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:28,409
hate you but maybe not

578
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:31,819
cell to start with let's

579
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,760
read and only stack I have very chips
legitimate readers

580
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,620
so like that that this is the thing that
they've been giving out emergency rooms

581
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,230
and so on

582
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,350
to so that they can scan you when you
come in on koch's

583
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:47,350
you know on the off chance that you're
one of the like 100 people

584
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,168
we've had think implanted

585
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:54,639
settle this is also as i understand it

586
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,759
the actual hardware that the use

587
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,370
in some their commerce deployment
slightly

588
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,759
you know the waiter was manually typing
in your code because

589
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,430
well because it when it was a gimmick so
there was no sense selling anything

590
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,160
better

591
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,160
back anyways let's read anally

592
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:22,410
its kinda slow

593
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,620
okay so that beat that you didn't hear
indicated

594
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,350
that it red successfully cell

595
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,420
currently its display name her very cute
ID which is 1022

596
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,920
than a lot of zeros than 470 63

597
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,140
we have no idea what that means it's
just a unique identifiers it literally

598
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,240
is just a number

599
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,440
they're just yeah arm

600
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,480
some now let me read her arm

601
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,850
using my RFID tag reader you see a
couple

602
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:58,920
dots on my arm if you're close enough
that's just what we wanted to mark the

603
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,760
spot where my

604
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,410
RFID is if there's those aren't like a
result a few her pity

605
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:10,759
sell what I'm hoping against her arm
here

606
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,220
is the read and Hannah on in this case

607
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,800
depending on the this structure of the
and have the tag use a slightly

608
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,330
different

609
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,720
read and Hannah in this case on

610
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,930
proxy saw on the slide where we had a
picture I have

611
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,680
the tag close-up the end on the tag is a
fairy

612
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,480
rod lately fairly long and skinny with
findings on

613
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,400
in this case that the read and Hannah
sorta resemble

614
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,360
the tag antenna so so it's kinda
comforting

615
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:48,700
and this is what works best so I Fred

616
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:55,700
now om let me download the sample
Jonathan design this himself by the way

617
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:01,440
so you can see that we've received

618
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,900
a signal that has some structure to on

619
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,720
this is basically a a plot received
voltage

620
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:13,090
versus timer you know received electric
field in the air

621
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:17,980
versus time whatever you'd like to think
a bit eyes and it uses some particular

622
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,560
modulation scheme

623
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:23,610
to represent a particular bet as a
particular way for

624
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:28,040
over-the-air and you know the reason
might choose some particular modulation

625
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:28,740
scheme

626
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,530
is to represent the data in a way that
is readily sent

627
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,500
over at the radio line Indian very chips
case it's dead simple

628
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,210
that some Manchester think I haven't
looked into it very deeply

629
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,330
because to clone her ID there's no need
for me

630
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:49,650
into very deeply I just have to replay
whatever the tags at

631
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,060
because it's one we communications no
cryptographic security

632
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,470
no back and forth the tag transmits the
same time thing

633
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:01,220
each time it is a simple as it could be
oz

634
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,720
so what i do that is I

635
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,820
represent trace in

636
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,570
some more convenient way to replay this

637
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:15,360
is another representation %ah the exact
same trace

638
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,450
I just ran and then I can

639
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,310
op this device this reader that I'm
using

640
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,110
and different mode in which replays

641
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,370
and ID so it's was behaving like a tag
instead

642
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:35,589
even my career looks low-frequency
simulate so now I'll take the very cheap

643
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,140
reader

644
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:43,140
once again it takes a few moments are up

645
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:51,019
and same number right 470 63

646
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:54,019
you can come see it afterward if you
want thank you

647
00:38:54,019 --> 00:39:01,019
om so com

648
00:39:01,219 --> 00:39:06,459
I can do much more impressive things any
this reader is designed this reader is

649
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:10,799
designed with signal processing hardware
to do like the 13.56 megahertz

650
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:13,959
tags: om I have written DSP code

651
00:39:13,959 --> 00:39:17,049
I can do a lot more than clone a pet tag

652
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:20,869
wets by while thats

653
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:24,380
by she came with cell

654
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,000
it sold %um a pet am so where you have
to imagine I think in this situation is

655
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,690
that you wouldn't have to nice people
sitting up here

656
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:35,530
doing this but if he did want to do some
kind of attack

657
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:39,720
on someone who's using one of these
chips for access control and there are

658
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,070
companies that are using

659
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,740
the chips now for essentially keys to
get into

660
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:49,190
I secure areas if they're company the
exact same as a proximity card

661
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,870
yes so it's an yes all you have to do is
basically like

662
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,980
recipe against me in an elevator wanted
the beauty part so very tips is that the

663
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,370
company requires that they

664
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,930
always be installed in the same part of
your body so

665
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,060
great so now an attacker knows they're
always in this part if your arm

666
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:10,210
and so be quite simple for him to break
into

667
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,230
I'm a company like city watcher in
Cincinnati that puts all is there

668
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,750
secure data into RAM that you can only
access using your

669
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,060
completely secure non counterfeit a ball
VeriChip

670
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:25,220
actually they were smart enough to make
that only an interior door

671
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:29,120
om says so you know the the

672
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,580
they were full they knew it was a
gimmick install you hope yeah

673
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,250
so sorry do cuing our I

674
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,190
yeah what's if you have a question can
you line up at the mike

675
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,480
because they're recording everything you
say and say they want to hear

676
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,210
with you recommends companies

677
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,170
use a alternative technology for
implantation

678
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,150
unique the um you right now Phillips

679
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,730
as I said I'm all crossroads
experimenting with the Philips hi tack

680
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:06,510
which does have some crypto on it I
don't know how good it is

681
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:09,860
on so I think at this point there are

682
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,680
a lot decent implantable tax with
security

683
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,830
features that I would be right star
would you say there there's the I mean

684
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:18,420
if I were

685
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,770
if I for some I don't know why I would
want to implant myself with an RFID tag

686
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,509
but I

687
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,750
didn't want to do so when I wanna just
for 10 yeah and I want

688
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,170
to be cryptographically secure it's my
understanding that there is

689
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:35,850
there are the does fire hard out there

690
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,610
which are not available last capsules
that could be repackaged

691
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:43,620
pretty easily I i mean this is the kind
of thing you can't do it in your kitchen

692
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,759
you can do it with like thousands of
dollars equipment not

693
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,490
hundreds house almond and those issues

694
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:55,540
well dad is switches at least a known
quantity

695
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,380
yet Texas instruments has said that
they're gonna do you

696
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,560
on a 128 bit encryption and their
next-generation

697
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,799
have tags which are supposed to be used
in car keys

698
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,800
but they those are not on the market yet
in I talk to a rapper told me that knew

699
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,600
I was reading that security so

700
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:19,020
I don't know how true it is but heard
you mention

701
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,660
about you you're talking about RFID with
encryption

702
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:25,870
and it's my understanding

703
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:30,990
day are fed ease with encryption even up
to let's say two or three levels

704
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,340
are double or triple quadrupled

705
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,050
price objective RFID to do you really
think that the company's

706
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:43,290
in expanding money on something like
that

707
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:48,620
I you are correct that they do cost a
lot more money to manufacture

708
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,350
that price will be coming down I just as
the prices RFID is a striped of

709
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,170
precipitous Lee in the last few years

710
00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:01,010
and I think that if we can push
companies to do that for applications

711
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:01,990
that require it

712
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,250
I think we I think it is reasonable to
expect

713
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,470
that you know consumers might demand the
company use

714
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:12,390
I excellent encryption in an RFID the in
their car keys

715
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:17,609
like a set for applications that require
it I think it's right for EPC tag on gum

716
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:21,980
now that's ridiculous its so you know do
you think they would use

717
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:25,820
as on time may be inactive RFID

718
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,680
first well possible that's

719
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,299
yet good what what what because I mean
just

720
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,800
probably some yard you know this but
there there's basically two

721
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,560
considerations

722
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,370
that make Kirk target be expensive in an
RFID tag

723
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,770
the first wine is basically dietary

724
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:52,160
the cost up the silicon to make the
transistors to implement this more

725
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,740
sophisticated

726
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:57,310
state machine be because obviously state
machine the King

727
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:01,140
calculate you know ates whatever

728
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,660
is going to be a lot more complex than
one that can just read an ID

729
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:09,960
out wrong so that is the same
consideration that would be present

730
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,830
whether it hag were powered over the air
or whether it were powered of battery or

731
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:15,420
whether

732
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,800
into the wall but the additional
consideration

733
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,090
is that our ID tags are powered
over-the-air

734
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:25,490
this means that every Mike her why is
precious

735
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:28,570
because the amount of power that you
require

736
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:31,920
determines the amount of power that the
reader must supply to you

737
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,450
and that determines you read range more
or less

738
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:39,500
by again for something like eighty
Harkey

739
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,610
transmitter you're actually in a pretty
good situation from a read range

740
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:46,360
standpoint because because you're right
on top

741
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,860
basically so in that case you really
wouldn't get any kind

742
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,860
gain im going to an active

743
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,450
tag as opposed to a passive one because
what's driving the cost

744
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,860
is the dietary be

745
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,990
the military is looking a lot into using
active tax cuz they wanna have greater

746
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:08,030
restraint is mostly for equipment and
things like that but

747
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,750
also with an active tag battery life is
a consideration to you

748
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:15,270
they die so they become useless after a
while

749
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:18,370
so

750
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:22,350
some worried about the case but we do
have skew I frady's

751
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,509
and then it easy to have device

752
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:29,630
and surgical devices somebody kidnaps
you take that I feed you physically from

753
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:30,350
you

754
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:33,799
and then implanted in himself and run

755
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,050
so these so I think about physical
security

756
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,300
wife ideas physical security from plants
that are fighting

757
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,720
yes CSS I don't want to move all I'm
afraid that somebody will

758
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,020
to take this in case someone but you
could to take it out if it's very easy

759
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:49,690
to

760
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,820
remove Philip K Dick future worry and
people kind of your arm to have ya

761
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,800
hits them quite easy in the sense that
you need to cut somebody's arm

762
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,770
and up to gunpoint just remove this yes
ticket from somebody else

763
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,540
you know all on nobody in the
implantable RFID space is looking

764
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,560
that forty I mean as we said you know
the only

765
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,980
you know human implantable RFID that's
being marketed has

766
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:16,340
I mean is sending their ID in the clear
so obviously they're not too worried

767
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,810
about security or

768
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:22,009
they're lying about security basically
and then you have to understand

769
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:25,290
that that you know human implantable
RFID d

770
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:28,360
at the moment comprises you know
Arkwright

771
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,670
kak sa eat attention-seeking

772
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,580
and sword demo deployments that are
really use

773
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:39,750
are not widespread yes cell you know it
at the moment it just doesn't come up

774
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,070
because I N E

775
00:46:41,070 --> 00:46:44,250
you know we were looking for some cool
thing to do now that we can clone

776
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,300
VeriChip you know what maybe we can open
a door somewhere

777
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:51,590
I can buy drink on her cap by it's
really hard to find someone is actually

778
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,370
using

779
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:55,660
for something how but I would say just

780
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,339
just say to have a science fictional
moment I mean you could imagine

781
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:02,720
if somebody didn't wanna have physical
security in a future where this stuff

782
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,300
actually achieved widespread deployment
to stop questionable

783
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,950
on you could have an RFID tag that was
on somehow

784
00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:14,720
sensitive to body temperature so if it
were taking out of your body for example

785
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,390
on you know maybe that way causative

786
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,790
kill itself basically but you know there
be ways around that to you

787
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,660
just keep it warm want to take it out so
but yeah I mean it's the stuff of

788
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:26,899
science fiction it's fine

789
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,130
number and of course everyone has heard
the case

790
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,750
I'll the finger bring reader on the car

791
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,550
and the router gruesome car that

792
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:41,190
I think that made the rounds same thing

793
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:45,220
right

794
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:50,180
you mentioned that they were being used
by hospitals they're standing for people

795
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,310
what information they gather enough the
current ID tags

796
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:58,330
I the week that the system works again
the number on the very kept is just a

797
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:58,910
unique

798
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,370
I d so one said

799
00:48:02,370 --> 00:48:06,560
the well I am pull it out because
probably confidential I have the

800
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,090
protocol that one hospital

801
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:11,140
has written for arm

802
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,770
than one when it was included in a
journal article one of the reviewers

803
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:14,830
complained about

804
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,670
spelling mistakes and about anyways the

805
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,820
hospital will try to read you then they
will tight

806
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,020
the number that be read into some
network accessible database

807
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,300
run by your chap and that basically
polls up like a little scrapbook Cove

808
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,370
whatever you chose to provide and you
pay and to have that service you pay per

809
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:39,150
month to have your medical records in
their database

810
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,359
and this just brings up another issue
with RFID is that

811
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:46,220
neither has touched on which is that the
security of your r fi di is really

812
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:49,690
in the database where all the
information is being kept his most RFID

813
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:50,440
is

814
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,070
give off a simple number that's been
correlated to a database and so then a

815
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:55,750
lot of the security issues

816
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,950
windup really being database security
issues which is something that we

817
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,400
understand fairly well

818
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,630
so and certainly the case is very except
thats

819
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,290
what you're talking about is a database
concern

820
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,800
there

821
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,930
you access to my question I was gonna
ask you about do you ever for C

822
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:19,609
coupling this technology as it stands
right now it's pretty crappy it's just a

823
00:49:19,609 --> 00:49:22,890
you know small number but this
technology could be modified

824
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:26,000
to just give a longer key so could be a
public key

825
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,710
for example and an eighth in a three-way
system it could be have something

826
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:33,470
when this case be something like a pet
and and they know something which would

827
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,609
be a pin number

828
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:37,900
stored in a database to you do you see
this technology

829
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:41,830
without one without two-way RFID chips
being expanded

830
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:47,509
maybe encompass something like how ATM
cards are currently being used

831
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,980
comic could be imminent Rd RFID chips on
the market like the ones that are used

832
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,340
in

833
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:55,830
library books that can hold a lot of
data and their writeable

834
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,970
on so you could conceivably actually

835
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:03,109
have fairly lengthy

836
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:07,000
no key in there like the biggest issue
with public is trust

837
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,040
is it yours yeah you know if if you have
any hotties pretty good

838
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,890
some pretty good but i mean well
difference between that and just meeting

839
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:17,670
in a room in calling out your number and
saying hello I'm here this is really

840
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,290
there is no yes so why would you do it I
it's fun

841
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:25,050
no I admit it's fun so there's the fun
factor but I think

842
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,080
you know will it be used for that I
don't know I mean I think both

843
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,090
Jonathan I are pretty dubious about the
fact about whether these will be

844
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:35,260
deployed widely at all because they're
so crappy at this point but maybe

845
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,500
possibly a

846
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,050
you stop yet can we do one more question
nursery

847
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:48,020
okay one more question my only question
is is it possible for the RFID

848
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,970
actually around your body I me and it
just right under your skin

849
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:55,010
and won't get in your bloodstream its
render the skin and it will not get into

850
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,540
your bloodstream it goes into that

851
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,450
Sarfati area on there it's very unlikely
to move around

852
00:51:01,450 --> 00:51:05,230
it's much smaller than say and norplant
which there's a lot of research on our

853
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,290
plants about whether they migrate
whether this car and stuff like that

854
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:12,920
if you don't know in our client is
looking up on the interwebs

855
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,120
so so I don't think there's any evidence
that they move around

856
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:21,160
they could and they could get start but
you know more research needs to be done

857
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,870
more people need to be implanted

858
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:26,440
again from a medical standpoint none of
this is real

859
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,450
back exciting it's a buyer's its

860
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:33,890
its dope glass in your body it's like
you now people have way more exotic send

861
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,770
their bodies

862
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:40,310
think

863
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:47,310
yeah okay well thank you very much

864
00:51:51,630 --> 00:51:54,529
coming up next in this room is maxed
right tak

865
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:56,549
and the MetroCard in five minutes
