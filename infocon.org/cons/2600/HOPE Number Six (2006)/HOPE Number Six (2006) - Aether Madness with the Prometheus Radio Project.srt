1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:02,760
all right

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,950
let's get started in a

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:09,230
slow down on the projectiles real
quickly this is uh... if their madness

4

for a while uh... they haven't

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,119
fighting the painter difficult fight and
that is to get

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,669
radio stations on the air that don't
sell

8
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:25,789

and five days

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,110
pride in what is effectively been the
takeover of the uh... public airwaves

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,490
all of these guys have fun out a long
hard fight and they put dont

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,210
just in a barn raising as they put ten
stations on the air they send out some

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,170
great literature every now and then tell
you how it's going

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,960
uh... as opposed to some other causes
that just send you letters to go holy

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,839
shit okay so what about a com

fifty whatever you can afford they're
doing really grassroots stuff

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,699
so

cause because they have a lot of rabin's

31
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,870

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,179
uh... as a bunch of pirates that were
running a pirate radio station

40
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,159
basically length

41
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,459
peace and social justice in housing aids
activists that

42
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:18,649
you know we would spend all of our time

43
00:02:18,649 --> 00:02:20,190
like putting together

44
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,299
you know these elaborate uh...

45
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,490

to get onto t_v_ and get the message is
across the river

47

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,039
don't do this stopped that now

49
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,359
and that was about as much as we could
get into the media

50
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:41,569
heard about the spire radio operators
that that could actually start radio

51
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,689
stations

52
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:45,948
we uh... non-aggressive ever

53
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:49,579
being on the radio none of us knew
anything about radio we have no

54
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:53,089
technical background what whatsoever but
we decided that we are going to teach us

55
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:53,760
how

56
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,668
teacher self-help how to start a radio
station

57
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,709
handphone well we

58
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,589
uh... we we we bought one of these
little radio cats as we put it together

59
00:03:02,589 --> 00:03:06,949
and we'd sold it all together the way it
suddenly instructions and then

60
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:08,889
then likely turn on it

61
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:09,859
numerologist

62
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,389
did absolutely nothing

63
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:15,029
and then we bought another one in and

64
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,950
you know a little smoke or whatever but

65
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:19,529
uh... but then that did nothing you

66
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:23,149
and that but then finally after after
nine months we finally managed to light

67
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,619
make a working happened transmitter that
could go

68
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:28,299
a couple miles around

69
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:30,999
around our our house

70
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:35,029

five anti-nuclear movements and
anti-apartheid movement in you know

uh... all kinds of different activism

73
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,870
i never saw project take-offs and
quickly with so many different kinds of

74
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,659
people get involved

75
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,369
there was are

76

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,569
from the seventies

87
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:22,619
it was an amazing radio station it was
nothing like anything else that we've

88
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,639
ever heard

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,360
we ran it for a while

90
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,370
copper about

91
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,689
i'd hear half before the f_c_c_ start
chasing us down and but we found

92
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,210
as for supplies

93
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,090
to be radio pilots and and it was cool
any we had a really really great time

94
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:39,120
running the radio station

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
what we found was that

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,859
and head out our peak we had like haiti
programmers we're on seven nights a week

97
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,939
it was it was just an amazing station

98
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,989
but what we start to find was that for
every do you do that we have there right

99
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,720
five other people that really wants to
be part of our station

100
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,150
but they're just cut

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,110
and

102
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,069
the one that broke my heart was this the
p o p m

103
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,809
bob journalists shit

104
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:06,099
she'd accident journalist in ethiopia

105
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,279
uh... and she wanted to cover

106
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,639
like all the issues of all the africans
moving into our neighborhood

107
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:12,490
and

108
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,729
out just the day before her first show
she was like

109
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,409
i can't do it at you know

110
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,720
like if i if i'm there when the f_c_c_
boston there

111
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,409
then they're gonna like call me away and
send me back to where the warriors and

112
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,090
we have this sort of realization which
is that

113
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,889
coolest i realize

114
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,500
we didn't believe that that

115
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,490
that community radio should just be for
the reckless

116
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,499
we believe that it should be for
everybody

117
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:41,870
and that there should be radio stations
in every town every community

118
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,559
parents are

119
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,550
so it kinda had this realization

120
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,259
at the same time the s_e_c_ came in a

121
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,449
after six

122
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:53,020
tries they came in the kick down the
door and they took away the pirate radio

123
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,068
stations

124
00:05:56,069 --> 00:05:57,280
source of pricing

125
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
really no one more than costs

126
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
pop the same week that they kicked down
the door and it took the radio station

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,519
out of

128
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,019
out of our house

129
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,159
date

130
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:13,419
uh... they announced that they were
getting ready to change the rules that

131
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:18,049
that there are over a thousand pirates
on the arab and that uh... as bad as

132
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,289
they claim the pirate radio was

133
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:24,960
that our complaints about the ownership
of the media were legitimate

134
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,699
and that any

135
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,249
group that wants to go for ordinary
community radio license

136
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:34,650
they were going to make a way that i was
possible

137
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,819
so uh... praneeth israel project started
in the fall of nineteen ninety eight

138
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,869
to be done vehicle of the legalization
of community radio and to you

139
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:49,650
go out and capture those those licenses
that the f_c_c_ was offering

140
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,269
four our progressive groups around the
around the united states

141
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:56,669
uh... we battled for several years all
we did

142
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:00,900
uh... tens of thousands of dollars worth
of studies and all kinds of jumping

143
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,740
through hoops of the f_c_c_ button two
thousand actually passed a new set of

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,709
rules that allow poor

145
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:09,860
neighborhood community radio stations to
go on the air

146
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,110
bob it was the first time they've really
given out licenses and in over ten years

147
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,469
and uh... and so is really really
exciting person so

148
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,569
bomb while we have been in the habit of
like traveling around the country and

149
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:23,039
helping people set up by radio stations

150
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,889
palm harbor drop out a little more
boring because we went around the

151
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:26,620
country

152
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,959
and started to people helped a lot of
people work and and and get regulations

153
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:32,870
but to get off

154
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:38,240
uh... because possible years later arm
the licenses started to come out

155
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,259
and tom we've been building radio
stations ever since then

156
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:42,590
he built the first

157
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,090
uh... recession it's ever been licensed
to civil rights organization

158
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,039
the first for a decision that was ever
why since two any environmental group

159
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,159
bomb we've

160
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:56,009
we built uh... all radio station that's
used by the coalition monthly workers a

161
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,359
former pres group

162
00:07:57,359 --> 00:08:00,009
in uh... in florida

163
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,339
and so it's uh... it's really exciting
exciting work for us to to be putting

164
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:05,409
radio

165
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:09,690
uh... and and uh... and the broadcast
microphone in the hands of these groups

166
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,960
that otherwise would be ne almost
completely powerless and voiceless

167
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,960
we have a couple of

168
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,749
we have a couple of set backs out

169
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:28,319
while we convince the f_c_c_

170
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,930
to you all out local radio stations and
to get out more licenses to these small

171
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,840
grassroots organizations

172
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,219
the national association of broadcasters
and national public radio

173
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,640
work absolutely furious and they decide
they're going to do

174
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,088
everything in our power to stop it and
so

175
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:46,560
they got a bill passed in congress

176
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,080
took away about three quarters of the
possible low-power radio licenses and

177
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,210
all of the licenses in the major urban
areas

178
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,040
so under the s_e_c_'s rules according
tot ccs engineers

179
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,300
we would have been able to build about

180
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,270
fav

181
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,019
about twenty-five weekly radio stations

182
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,670
in the top ten bourbon carriers united
states

183
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,490
but congress actually

184
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,220
overruled the f_c_c_ took away
three-quarters of that

185
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,779
and left it so that there were actually
mill radio stations in the top fifty

186
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,980
carbon markets in the united states

187
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,040
and so the places we've been building
radio stations for the past

188
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,089
five years

189
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,460
our places like iraq was is the reason
at all

190
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,190
like

191
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,010
uh...

192
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,930
the motley florida

193
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,200
portsmouth new hampshire

194
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,310
pisses us off

195
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,590
on the other hand it's actually been
really uh... it's been important work

196
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,500
because uh... while there may be several

197
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,930
pretty decent radio stations in los
angeles maybe

198
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,960
uh... there has never been a decent
radio station alpha looses louisiana

199
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,829
until

200
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:54,890
uh... until about the civil rights group
the problem

201
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,500
and when you when you look at those red
state police state maps and all that

202
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,320
sort of thing

203
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,390
and we're building radio stations

204
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,830
uh... in all these places and what i've
learned

205
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,360
being a city slicker

206
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,590
you know from from brooklyn originally
is that they're progressive people and

207
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,110
every single town in this country

208
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,420
but the problem is that there was less

209
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,339
and they're invisible answer and they
have no power and they have no way of

210
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,680
really communicating

211
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,370
so it's been really important for us to
be doing all this work in these really

212
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,140
really small towns where

213
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,330
uh... where you know

214
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,140
elections get decided

215
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,760
where where it you know people live and
work but they're not really exposed

216
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,519
anything

217
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,090
but the evangelical radio stations of
the of the christian right

218
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,130
so home

219
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:43,130
uh... the one other thing ever since we
started building radio stations in the

220
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,750
united states least star gain a lot of

221
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,240
requests from

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,920
countries around the world

223
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,319
polygamy bill radio stations do you want
to build a radio station

224
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,160
intercourse about the uh... no can you
help us build a radio station in the

225
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,140
fall

226
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,120
and you know we started

227
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,580
cops you know possum what army

228
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,200
and in my book you know

229
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,710
already that you have

230
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,380
so mostly what we've done so far as
we've done some technical support over

231
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,340
email

232
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,200
and had a lot of these places are places
where there there is no internet gap

233
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,659
there is no

234
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,349
uh... they're they're there's really
nothing people live on a dollar to per

235
00:11:19,349 --> 00:11:20,440
day

236
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
and uh... and serenity l

237
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,330
is is our is a much more central form of
communication then it down and even is

238
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,720
nonsense

239
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,770
so on

240
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,980
i have a quick clip from a radio station
that we have to do you get to build in

241
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,280
tanzania

242
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,180
uh...

243
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,920
last summer and

244
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,420
neon

245
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,959
we were all

246
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:46,960
that up at first won the pennant

247
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:10,710
president cory

so welcome to

249
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,500
let's look at the lowest

250
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,730
where abed

251
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,900
it's a city

252
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,600
s_c_c_ was forward to

253
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,570
in nineteen

254
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,350
that the other people

255
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,160
is this

256
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,010
this is the muscle

257
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,689
we are

258
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,640
organization

259
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,290
his i'd like to see

260
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,959

274
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,170
that the other said

275
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,210

326
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,319
pretty exciting right one not my head
and that is less eccentric or curse of

327
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,668
the above the point evening

328
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:25,500
into infinity it's kind of cool but

329
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,330
so what you decide there it is uh...
barn raising a little bit later andy

330
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,939
guns are technical organizer will talk
about

331
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,110
how to build a radio station with us
later this summer and how we do these

332
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,320
all around the country and all around
the world bank

333
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,149
while we would love to see you for
example lake climb up to the roof of

334
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,570
this hotel

335
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,820
weekday little transmitter to hit you
have in my back upstairs solder it

336
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,779
together

337
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:53,750
slap some

338
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,760
piece of copper on and start like

339
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,210
radio free hole

340
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,750
unfortunately it's a slight because of
the reasons p_g_ is explained we're

341
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,980
trying to work at the f_c_c_

342
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,490
and in congress in the united states to
expands community radio so immigrant

343
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:15,450
workers groups so schools so churches so
community organizations that can risk

344
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,170
dean harris because of their safety

345
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,309
can have a station that they can use out
of the closet

346
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:24,620
and we're all out of the closet here
that media senior project is just you

347
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,169
know

348
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:26,400
the way we are so

349
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,049
what i'm going to talk to you little bit
about it's pretty boring and you know

350
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:34,129
that you might not want to do it but
it's about some of the pieces of

351
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,460
legislation

352
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,010
better on the table right now that can
help you

353
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,220
expand this kind of service

354
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,020
to thousands more community groups
across the united states and maybe a

355
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,010
little bit later we can talk about

356
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,179
setting up these kinds of policies
around the world so

357
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,620
petri introduces um...

358
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,230
out the national association of
broadcasters and national public radio

359
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,970
actually pretended

360
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,260
but there was a technical problem with
low-power f_m_

361
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,840
they said well if you have a smooth jazz
station now on a clear channel at a

362
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,830
hundred point one let's say

363
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,310
and in the same town you wanted to build
a low-power f_m_ station the national

364
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:19,940
association of broadcasters an npr got
together and they convince congress that

365
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,000
you wouldn't be able to build one of
those stations at a hundred point three

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,210
which is the first adjacent channel to a
hundred point one

367
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,640
or a hundred point five red hats the
second and jason channel

368
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,470
but they also said that there wouldn't
be any room in a hundred point seven

369
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,200
f_n_

370
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,130
and the same way back right if you're a
two hundred point one

371
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,380
ninety nine point ninety couldn't build
a low-power f_m_

372
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,760
ninety nine point seven

373
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,039
but they also said he couldn't build at
ninety nine point five the third and she

374
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:49,280
said channel

375
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,240
two hundred point one have found

376
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,460
now there were many decades of
engineering history and experience

377
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,700
proving that there was plenty of room

378
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,470
but you know

379
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,480
congress members really don't care about
what's true but they do care about who

380
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,760
pays for their political junkets and who
donates to their campaign so

381
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,090
they were able to use women low-power
f_m_ using are build that

382
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,179
i find very ironically named to the
radio broadcast preservation ac

383
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,180
of two thousand everything that's pretty
funny but

384
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:26,190
we were able to pushed the f_c_c_ and
congress mandated that the f_c_c_ had to

385
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,120
prove

386
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,430
that there wouldn't be room for a
low-power f_m_ station in minneapolis

387
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,850
that that wouldn't be room

388
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,210
for low-power f_m_ station in new
orleans as well as thousands of other

389
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,440
communities across the country so the
f_c_c_ hired a defense contractor

390
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
corporation which you know

391
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,110
is always really trustworthy in great
compromise your corporations m_i_t_i_

392
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:46,860
ready

393
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,640
and the miter corporation studied with
two point two million dollars in lots of

394
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,940
engineering tests

395
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,330
whether or not local power f_m_ stations
would interfere

396
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,949
with full power broadcasts and they
proved beyond the shadow of a doubt

397
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,770
that there is plenty of room for
low-power f_m_ all across this country

398
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,520
what can we do about that

399
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,080
well after the

400
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,250
out might appreciate made that study
improved it

401
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,630
a number of congress members started
introduced bills that would expand

402
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,270
low-power f_m_ radio services when you
take out your pen

403
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,650
and you know at any rate this september

404
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,950
if you want a low-power f_m_ station in
your hometown

405
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,900
and you don't win in a really big city
like new york it's almost impossible to

406
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,629
love a low-power f_m_ here

407
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:37,450
but if you live in the come as any other
majors big city besides new york

408
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,650
chicago and los angeles we might be able
to find

409
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,659
a frequency if we expand low-power f_m_

410
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,030
there's a senate bill it's senate bill
three twelve

411
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,010
that's three one two

412
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,530
it was sponsored by john mccain

413
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,350
you know interesting man from arizona

414
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,450
and patrick leahy

415
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,770
and he's from vermont and maria cantwell
from washington state

416
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,820
and that bill would expand low-power af
and to that

417
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,610
thirty cases frequency

418
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,600
there's also a bill in the house of
representatives that would put forward

419
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,769
by uh... louise slaughter

420
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,940
she's a congressman from upstate new
york

421
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,039
it's house built

422
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:16,510
thirty seven thirty one

423
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,800
that's three seven three one

424
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,070
some right now you can call your
congress members although there probably

425
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,689
you know not in the office right now

426
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,200
but you can call them next week and say

427
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,769
i want you to support senate bill three
twelve or household thirty seven thirty

428
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:32,499
one

429
00:22:32,499 --> 00:22:35,460
to expand low-power radio to my
community

430
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,180
and then there's a number of other bills
that are on the table right now to you

431
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:43,340
on the senate bill three twelve was
recently amended to a huge

432
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:47,209
telecommunications bill you know these
teachers who rang to this wonderful

433
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,110
quote

434
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:51,020
uh... the internet a series of houston
and

435
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,900
high and that's how you get some lapd

436
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,310
this next minute or so well uh... you
know that that was put forward by

437
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,029
senator ted stevens

438
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:01,779
stephens just put forward a huge piece
of legislation that would do everything

439
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:04,040
from completely geyer

440
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,310
our ability to quicktax expert
information out on the internet and get

441
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,269
information back

442
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,440
without worrying that it might get
eroded by comcast ever-rising can stay

443
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
on the line to go to our house you know
that net neutrality stuff

444
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,080
and it would also

445
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,019
prevent community organizations that
have fought for years to build public

446
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:23,750
access t_v_ centers

447
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,360
it would prevent them from being able to
have the power to negotiate their own

448
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,520
franchises

449
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,429
so it's a really terrible bell

450
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:33,730
but our legislation was just amended
onto it

451
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,050
so you can also tell your congress
members that you support low-power f_m_

452
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,529
on the senate bill

453
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:43,669
uh... engaged also houses they'll call
the call backs that is like a companion

454
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:46,960
bill to this but you have the you also
have to understand that we are going to

455
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,330
stay together to fight this dell if it
doesn't make the net neutrality

456
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,100
principles getting code it into law and
if it doesn't let community

457
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,010
organizations continue to fight for
public access so if you want to learn

458
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,340
more about how low power f_m_ swatted
nsx

459
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,850
with some of these larger battles for
public access he he hand for net

460
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,820
neutrality

461
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,840
you can buy our web site which is the
committee is radio dot org

462
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,840
and you can also go to see the internet
dot

463
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,750
the last thing i wanted to talk about
winter which is going to lead in a

464
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,450
little bit to some stuff that was then
that that i was going to say is that

465
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,410
one thing that

466
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,210
from ups today dot on the west you able
to see you the f_c_c_

467
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,360
and win

468
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:32,000
when the federal communications
commission tried to do you regulate

469
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,249
media ownership in the united states and
so what does that mean

470
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:40,070
so that means that a big company like
clearchannel or big company like viacom

471
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,099
in two thousand two two thousand three
they were fighting

472
00:24:43,099 --> 00:24:47,030
so they could own even more stuff in
your hometown to make it on

473
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,190
the newspaper

474
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,440
so they could on that boat might make
the two major television stations

475
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,230
so they could on many more radio
stations in a market where the f_c_c_

476
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,789
whispered keeping them

477
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,930
just at a certain number and so because

478
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:05,090
activists like you guys because people
who understood technology but also

479
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,040
understood but it was important for that
technology to get into the hands of

480
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
community groups you know

481
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,930
you guys are hackers on planet air you
not

482
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,520
hackers on planet bedroom were hackers
implanted bc ear

483
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,170
here to make sure that this technology
helps all of us to

484
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,279
really haven't the better world sound

485
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,339
you know hackers have played a basement
doesn't have a steering but so because

486
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:30,059
of that like because people just like
you who really wanted low-power radio

487
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,210
stations

488
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,590
told the f_c_c_ in two thousand to
ninety thousand three that if there was

489
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,770
media consolidation that they wouldn't
be able to put their stations on the air

490
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,920
we were able to have standing in in
federal court to see

491
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,960
for them because they haven't listened
to us they have

492
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,050
to the two million people who had sent
in comments and so

493
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,480
we were able to be there would be you
along with many other allies especially

494
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,440
the media access project

495
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,100
public interest law firm in d_c_ were
able to see the f_c_c_ and win

496
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:05,010
so that was really awesome that means at
clearchannel doesn't suck as much as

497
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,820
they possibly crude right this second

498
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,668
however the f_c_c_ is going to be trying
to deregulate again

499
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:16,770
this year in two thousand six oh if you
want to make sure that they do not

500
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,389
own everything in your town and they do
not also on

501
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,230
the nuclear power plants a concert venue
and all of the two words of the worst

502
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,620
musicians in

503
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:29,659
just some terrible suffering you should
also go to stop big media dot com

504
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:33,279
and threw me this is going to continue
to be involved in that fight as well

505
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,320
that's all the stuff about legislation
and regulation i can answer questions

506
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,450
later on

507
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,570
but we want to see a little bit more
from andy now there's gonna tell you

508
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,320
about our upcoming barn raising and how
you can get involved with building radio

509
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,320
stations all around the world

510
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,640
weddings and a gun

511
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,009
uh... and uh... ah tech

512
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:01,139
guy permit the assigned the most

513
00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:03,360
light any engineer

514
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,870
of the enough people ever meet if so

515
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,050
one of my

516
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:10,668
big tasks is to serve organized

517
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:13,640
the technical portion of the barn
reasons that we have

518
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,990
we've had ten barn reasons so far

519
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,740
and these are weekend long advance where

520
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,380
people from are the local community and
volunteers from all over the country

521
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,360
meet and uh...

522
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,190
akak like

523
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,970
a conference like thing

524
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,480
where there's panels

525
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,149
and uh... workshops and discussions on

526
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:36,620
how to run a radio station but also some
of the technology behind it

527
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,010
and while that's going on we also be

528
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,640
the whole radio station

529
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,650
from microphone to antenna

530
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,100
which includes building furniture
configured won't be put in

531
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,510
putting up the tower testing transmitter
doing all that stuff

532
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,030
and the majority of it

533
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,009
is all done

534
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,330
by people who may have

535
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,350
never touched any of that before

536
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,330
probably a majority of it is is done by
volunteers to

537
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,929
is the first time that touches soldering
iron

538
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:05,740
a transmitter any kind

539
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,570
and so it's really exciting to see you
know the few

540
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,929
uh... text that we bring out

541
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,919
not touching any of the tools ice cold
and sternly

542
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,429
if they touch any of the tools

543
00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:18,250
and so i make sure that all volunteers

544
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,019
actually build the station

545
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:22,620
and it just shows this

546
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,540
this technology behind radio it's not
that complicated

547
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,850
it's up to people like us in this room
to show people that you technologies not

548
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,650
this scary

549
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,790
and it's really

550
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,270
we have to do mystified

551
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,120
so we can show that how it can be used

552
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,740
for you know a social justice and things
that are good

553
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,870
instead of just you know toys in
blinking lights in i'd pots and things

554
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,409
like that

555
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:47,850
they're all very nice

556
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:53,500
but aren't necessarily doing anybody any
good

557
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,410
clemency

558
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,130
look at the same time that people are

559
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,000
gaining control of the means to make
radio

560
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,210
they're seeing that

561
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:09,450
we

562
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,290
can run the station ourselves to and we
can take control of the media itself

563
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,940
and actually

564
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,370
you know say something important on the
air one of the big things that the

565
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,770
religious right

566
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,600
has done is that they've

567
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,850
worked just grasped on with their

568
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:28,020
talents of steel into as many radio
stations across the country that they

569
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,950
can

570
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,170
and that's how they're really getting
their agenda out there

571
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,780
and one of the things that i want to
talk about is how we can take a little

572
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,320
bit of that back

573
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,379
and uh... book before you do that i
wanted to mention

574
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,870
our next barn raising

575
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:46,340
is in woodburn organ which about half
hour self

576
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,750
and it's with uh... pecan a farm worker
and tree planters union high

577
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:52,320
and it's gonna be com

578
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,740
a really really amazing barn raising

579
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,650
ordinance in

580
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,490
interesting technical challenges like
putting an antenna up on top of water

581
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,600
tower

582
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,590
uh... trying to shoot the audio across
with the wifi link in the mean coding

583
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,730
and become an audio teach-in

584
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:09,520
uh... also building

585
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,050
some uh... studios in it

586
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,080
in a new way in

587
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,860
we're gonna have a lot of uh...

588
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:18,930
challenges in that way and if indeed you
speak spanish taught me afterwards cuz

589
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,250
i'd really anne

590
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,139
spanish-speaking bilingual

591
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:25,350
texan engineers and such so

592
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,910
come talking after the panel

593
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,129
that's obvious

594
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,290
eighteen through twenty

595
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,928
yes but is it

596
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,419
so it's coming up shortly if you can
make it out to be great to see y'all

597
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:42,909
there

598
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,100
that next upcoming chance

599
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,040
to really get your hands on a radio
station is what i want to talk about

600
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,420
and you know this using in the work
everywhere but

601
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,610
in uh... probably first quarter
second-quarter first half of two

602
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:57,070
thousand seven

603
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,750
that ccs going to be opening up

604
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,520
anew

605
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:04,350
application window for non-commercial an
educational

606
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,490
radio station user f_m_

607
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,790
full power stations anything from a
hundred walks

608
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,960
like two hundred thousand ones

609
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,020
so anywhere that the state that their
space left on the dial

610
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:19,080
is uh... up for grabs and that means

611
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,510
probably not here in new york city

612
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:25,350
usually it'll be someplace so more rural
small towns

613
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,670
small cities

614
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:29,850
um... i mean there might be some
surprises out there

615
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,470
where light you might be able to catch
the however

616
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,430
rang at the very huge city

617
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:39,800
uh... it's really you know it's going to
be up to us

618
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,200
all of you too

619
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,470
you know fine

620
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:45,990
someone that you may know you met with
in an area that's perfect for this and

621
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,320
if you're interested in starting a
station

622
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,830
this is your big chance

623
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,919
and you should really you should check
out our web site

624
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,680
meet this radio all the information is
on there

625
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,810
or talk to me afterwards

626
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,270
because this is really

627
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:01,590
probably going to be one of the last
chances

628
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,570
that we have to get

629
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,320
a radio station um... without

630
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,620
buying for

631
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,870
ten billion dollars or something like
that

632
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:13,550
and so

633
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,700
anyone out there that's interested
mister you might have been harmful or a

634
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,790
sister or a friend

635
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:22,970
or you know of a group in the midwest
just really is awesome and you should

636
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,100

if you get a chance if they don't buy
anything

691
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:40,420
it's the most humbling an amazing
experience is um...

692
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,169
the first one that i went to was also

helps people who are

696
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:53,679
fighting slavery

697
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,219
chattel slavery in this country in the
tomato fields of florida

698
00:38:58,219 --> 00:39:02,629
is the date there's nothing at is is
ekak month in hand

699
00:39:02,629 --> 00:39:04,930
the most impact mailing address have

700
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,698
and also that the humblest delivered via

701
00:39:07,699 --> 00:39:08,890
i'm helping people

702
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:11,589
who are struggling against those kind of
issues

703
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:15,109
uh... my name is number thirty eight

704
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:16,989
and the teen mom

705
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:18,279
param

706
00:39:18,279 --> 00:39:20,829
my momma the team i'm andrew group
projects

707
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:25,989
so that makes me a line of metal indians
at most likely person around it because

708
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:29,629
i think if people all around the country
about opens back down

709
00:39:29,629 --> 00:39:33,949
and the five hundred weight space and
grady county where is it off until they

710
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:34,999
stop that

711
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:38,630
if except andy lyman you just love
talking about it and sharing your net

712
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,839
knowledge of that with me with that

713
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,069
people asking quacks season

714
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:47,269
email me but we can talk later and i'm
at the media's radio dot o_ r_

715
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:48,749
uh...

716
00:39:48,749 --> 00:39:52,400
to be honest if you ac and struggle of
mine is that i've been being in my head

717
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:56,219
against the wild for about twelve years
minor stuff not because they care about

718
00:39:56,219 --> 00:39:59,319
it but because i care about class war

719
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:00,538
and

720
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,349
ownership is powai

721
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:07,779
the airwaves iras it's the most leverage
that we have to get communications back

722
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:09,289
into our own hands

723
00:40:09,289 --> 00:40:11,279
i mean i care a lot about that

724
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:13,769
uh...

725
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:20,769
pena hannah and i think it is saying
anything else you think

726
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:28,109
community yun and

727
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,609
and yet

728
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:32,529
you know i can send and many of the

729
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:36,519
you know they had and he knew him i mean
for them into those years

730
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,250
distinctive engineers into the room
saying yeah he is

731
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,179
that if you have is the same

732
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:44,919
is putting out the wide aids of

733
00:40:44,919 --> 00:40:48,919
the light bulb in your refrigerator it's
not going to do a damn thing

734
00:40:48,919 --> 00:40:51,618
saying that the stadium lights

735
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:54,829
that happy maggie lacks the scene is
putting out

736
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:58,399
i and we couldn't even get engineers in
the room for years if it passes they

737
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:05,399
were afraid you'd lose their jobs

738
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:08,600
and getting entire comments about

739
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,659
about the about this site

740
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:15,179
demanded and then mc

741
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,619
hindi says that the edison veteran
congressman

742
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:19,919
uh... cool edit

743
00:41:19,919 --> 00:41:21,239
and phoebe

744
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,599
saying oh i know about the odd our sins
of interference if we let people use

745
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:27,139
their own airwaves

746
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,519
and that and congress has power

747
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,480
well you know they can use a minister
must be true

748
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,069
we'll just have to have my reasoning
keeping people on the air management

749
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:41,759
i was listening to the last thing on
somebody

750
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:45,229
at the last cannot talk about the
complete cessation cessation of

751
00:41:45,229 --> 00:41:47,469
expression

752
00:41:47,469 --> 00:41:52,709
anyways happy people corroborating our
army acting an army using man and that

753
00:41:52,709 --> 00:41:55,308
doesn't include most of us

754
00:41:55,309 --> 00:41:59,779
seven many many interruptions figure out
her for twelve years

755
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:01,759
why people alike irons

756
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,470
and marlon brando

757
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,910
beyond the stamp is going to talk about
five translate space and then look

758
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,928
around this room and i think

759
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:14,389
gathers mccain's then that we were
talking about really

760
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,499
you know

761
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:22,499
say

762
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:29,569
we uh... we don't have all of the money
in it yet and he has and

763
00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:34,349
entry anybody that wants about how hot
six west if we listen to them

764
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:39,049
then we would never have gotten mines
the same time man

765
00:42:39,049 --> 00:42:40,369
and sell

766
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,460
it's a little embarrassingly ghar
roundtrip community group in tanks

767
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,829
planes of that money can't go on the
airwaves i've been rubber bands

768
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:50,239
fantastic so that we can apply here

769
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,859
to bring the communities

770
00:42:51,859 --> 00:42:53,808
you know the case

771
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:57,599
what we can talk about the way they can
make do with the reason we can't use the

772
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,609
airwaves is the case

773
00:42:59,609 --> 00:43:00,759
everywhere

774
00:43:00,759 --> 00:43:03,679
alice in the universe

775
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,909
radio waves airwaves

776
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:08,209
but at the s_e_c_ their property

777
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:10,538
and i feel replaced that's true

778
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:14,319
i mean it's the only place for that
matter is that it's true

779
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,249
and that's what we have to fight against

780
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:18,119
and we need people like uh... you know

781
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:22,009
to get into that discussion and take
take rempac space because

782
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:25,869
what you know i i i don't care about
accessing the magnolia there's always

783

don't know it's hahahaha come out to be

788
00:43:45,459 --> 00:43:46,888

792
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:03,599
people who have a sense of ownership
over the airwaves and

793
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,439
and you can get to myspace back

794
00:44:06,439 --> 00:44:09,359
and everybody knows that

795
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,808
i know that i i i felt fine and ask
people what it is

796
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:14,829
