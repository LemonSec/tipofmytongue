1
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:05,190
good evening everyone

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,020
it is Saturday 2200 area a

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:13,518
hope number six that means it's time to
learn about building a hackerspace

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,960
brought to you by

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,440
numbers 107 54 39

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,310
in ninety-eight usually I just enjoy
these panels but

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,419
today I'm on it I'm porch up

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm from the a new your computer
Community Connection project a place up

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,050
in Poughkeepsie New York

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,920
next to me Harry from the illegal

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,260
factory next in line binary from the AC
pastry

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,409
and last up is drago and also from your
computer

13
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,679
community computer Community Connection
project on you might be wondering why we

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,329
picked that name

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,329
NY CCCP seems funny we want to talk to
you about a whole bunch of things and

16
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,839
we're just going to start by asking

17
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:02,079
se binary why

18
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,580
a build a hackerspace much a reason
still

19
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,950
hackerspace there's many people tried is

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,440
pretty long history United States

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,080
but all main reason is cooperation he

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,289
can do so much more with many people
then just by yourself

23
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,410
and by pooling resources down with costs
putting everything

24
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,520
you can accomplished so much more and
another reason just getting everything

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,880
out your house your mom's basement
whatever it means

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,750
not having you know power tools and
computers and crap all over the place

27
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,670
it's pretty good have a separation that
and I think another important thing is

28
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,700
people work on projects and sometimes it
takes them quite a bit I'm

29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,810
to finish something it's nice to be able
to work on something a couple hours a

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,070
day and have it stay put anybody messing
with it

31
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,190
for you know weeks or months at a time
and then it's just good to have a

32
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,940
meeting spacer place to hang out

33
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,940
you know will always be there how did
you find all the people that

34
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,600
were interest in creating its kinda
plays a mean of course you know there's

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,710
a lotta each room

36
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,219
money from the people in your CD how big
is your CF to be I'm

37
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,138
cover I'm we able to do in Philly that
will

38
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:17,569
me on loan so is a fairly large city

39
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,129
and there was a small group of people
that kinda banded together

40
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,138
on and that some of us work for local
universities

41
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,299
so is fairly easy to put feelers out on

42
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,569
there were twenty six hundred meetings
that some of us would go to

43
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,170
an attempt to recruit new people on a
lot it was word-of-mouth minutes

44
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,749
it's really quite difficult to do that
by word of mouth on

45
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:42,310
summit things that we've toured around
with doing are having like

46
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,950
demonstrations are talks

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,959
or you know like some sort of community
involvement actually give

48
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,599
new people a reason to come and take a
look at the space

49
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,689
and you know see the sort of things that
we have to offer

50
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,219
I guess I double the all the groups
appear poughkeepsie is probably a small

51
00:02:59,219 --> 00:02:59,930
city

52
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,659
arm we found people just because they
were our friends are there centered

53
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:04,379
around college

54
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,969
we primarily found people in the Cape CV
the college's

55
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:12,159
are the colors that work for and your
friends at IBM in places like that

56
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,328
gives is very different than new york
city or Boston or philadelphia were sort

57
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:16,609
of

58
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,719
small is everything ok people should be
looking for in

59
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,309
potential space members his

60
00:03:25,309 --> 00:03:29,510
his people with big money bags important
days people with the

61
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,200
I mean I would think I I think it kinda
goes along two separate lines so

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,189
you definitely need people were stable
people who can contribute money

63
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,459
on a regular basis on but a lot of those
people are also very tied up in their

64
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:46,519
jobs you know they're working twelve
fifteen hours a day

65
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,819
they might have families so they can
really always contribute in terms of

66
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:50,430
time

67
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,569
so if you can get younger people who
have more time than they do money

68
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:57,870
and make you know I a good balance
between the two

69
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,799
you wind up with a pretty nice space
yeah I mean people are there definitely

70
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,900
the most important thing and I think
again the purposive why we don't talk

71
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,199
right now is just to share our
experiences

72
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,620
failures and successes and on hopefully
getting other people to create

73
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,510
you know working tax bases around the
country but most people think that

74
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,940
economics is in a driving factor in all
it's important miss it the second most

75
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,040
important factor

76
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,090
spaced the people in selecting the right
people stable people people a dedicated

77
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,560
to it

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,680
are the most important thing you can do
so

79
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,200
to find those people usually they find
you on

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,659
in Boston were pretty lucky enough where
it's happening on history and I

81
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,390
you know kinda walking on that and I
found them

82
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,610
they didn't find me pretty much so was
going out in the different spaces in

83
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,650
I was involved in some different spaces
in New Haven Connecticut

84
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,790
on and you to know people

85
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,030
bring your honor rent the space station
just find someone has money in C

86
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,740
here Suki's here's access or stuff you
know

87
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,670
three password all the machines and
everything it's really important to find

88
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,980
stable people

89
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,080
it's important to find people you can
trust because a they're going to have

90
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,169
the keys to get in next year's servers
and

91
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,650
all your tools and anything like that

92
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,760
see need to make sure you don't bring in
people that you're not comfortable with

93
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,440
either

94
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,390
people that a like 'cause other issues
or drama

95
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,159
anything like that or have other reasons
to be there just wanna space so they can

96
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,830
get

97
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,330
moms house or something like that
shouldn't

98
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,599
but left economics people with money
can't stress enough that if you do to

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,770
temper stars space

100
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,960
we found that on shouldn't really a
single person should not be paying more

101
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,120
than two hundred fifty dollars that
seems to be the magic number

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,890
this year at least for space anymore
than that if you were to lose that

103
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,140
number

104
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,740
nearly put the whole thing financial

105
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,750
would you say that the people involved
is the major contributing factor to

106
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,590
downfall i've seen I've seen many spaces

107
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,200
on I've only been involved in this wind
however

108
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,370
it seems to me that if there was one
thing I was gonna cause the downfall

109
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,830
a certain place in the people so I can
speak to this because we just have one

110
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,650
%uh var mi MOU

111
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:19,000
members move away on and he was probably
the most social out of the whole crew

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,260
and often brought everyone together be
it at the spacer barbecues or what not

113
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,430
and we've suffered quite a bit from that

114
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,980
there's you know not everyone not being
a socialist him

115
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,850
kind of meetings fizzle out a little bit
and so now trying to really

116
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,740
ramp up again you find a lot more just
called I mean definitely having someone

117
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,100
is very social and and can go out you
know has

118
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,630
many different frenzy in pole for many
different resources

119
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,719
makes it a bit easier to deal with

120
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,630
heard being described as being social
before it's pretty cool

121
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,020
but yeah it's definitely on important to
have stable people the usual several

122
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,950
plant if you know

123
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:04,560
people move on people moved to different
cities get jobs life changes

124
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,340
you know they can Ford page definitely
have a plan in place

125
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,890
so if one person were to leave be able
to still maintain this pace

126
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,229
that something is to be don't planning

127
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,330
into we've been fortunate to have enough

128
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,580
2g contingency plan if the kids see that
a we've had a few people that had to

129
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,719
drop out

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,480
because they got married and bought a
house or

131
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,800
various things like that were said sorry
guys can't do it anymore

132
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,170
they paid off for the last month and
moved on but a

133
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,240
if you plan well enough they have a bit
of a slush fund it doesn't hurt that

134
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,290
badly too if I did remember

135
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,130
we actually kept I think it was three
months worth of slush

136
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,170
in slush go well that's a good theory

137
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,040
it doesn't always work out that way I
was going to originally pulled all sorts

138
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,540
of graphs and charts in a way

139
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,720
nifty financial stuff which I never
actually choose to do

140
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,980
by Tom you do need to keep some here
funds

141
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,820
squared away so that you can at least
operate the space assuming

142
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,469
worst-case scenario for three months

143
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,290
you can you truck jump user some

144
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,830
speaking of things like leases which
provide flying

145
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,870
actual it's only once when she found the
people you have the drive in the means

146
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,510
to do that

147
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,349
next thing is to find placed stuff

148
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,530
so that what size like to determine what
kind of

149
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,160
a bigger place was I think for
poughkeepsie at least what we did was

150
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,770
we measure our apartment we decided that
well okay my

151
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,409
like crap roomies about 1/4 this
apartment

152
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:43,490
about half so I'm 18 so having

153
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,550
we ended up with a number like a
thousand square feet or 800 square feet

154
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,420
some like

155
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,680
yes something in the 800 to 1500 square
foot Rangers are original target

156
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,830
the the way commercial space generally
works is you pay

157
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,330
per square foot per year so

158
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,790
in an ever a number that we were looking
for seem to remember was about seven

159
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,980
bucks 750

160
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,130
or so and that's some dollars fifty says

161
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:12,210
was a price that you know people
advertises a its

162
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,230
seven dollars and fifty cents per square
foot per year

163
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,790
per mile no for you

164
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:22,110
if you do the math okay its you know
works out about

165
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,670
if it's in the square feet were

166
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,110
trust me it works out it didn't sound
right to you to me

167
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,400
in addition to that you have any sort of
shared space you have with other tenants

168
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,390
in the building

169
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,510
our case we bathrooms and others

170
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,640
sort facilities which shares week

171
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,710
beans for that there's more costs like
utilities get to that second

172
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:52,080
home book we're talking about size the
space will support about special final

173
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,100
sick that the next important thing the
suicide rate

174
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,020
at that stage things distance should
expect people to go that far

175
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,430
well as living in New Haven his writings
ArchiCAD

176
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,960
and I was a flick 45 minute drive for me
Cycle Show build

177
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,510
this to go there once a week if that

178
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,819
so should find a place that central
everybody

179
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,490
no one has to travel too far to get
there that's pretty

180
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,589
and then think that young

181
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,100
physical location obscurity gonna have a
place for the class

182
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,680
storefront or something like that wanna
have place that's pretty obscure no

183
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,790
one's gonna really know what's going on

184
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,140
advertising watching hearing here you
know

185
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:37,180
this couple that both some also checking
out the building and integrity

186
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,750
place it's falling down has water damage
a leaking roof stuff like that

187
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,940
and especially then take the electoral
system you have a lot of computers

188
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,300
running

189
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,960
you want something with fairly he said
little service

190
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,290
one thing I remember to keep see was so
when we moved in the

191
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,279
there is a a certain for the ceiling
which had been replaced so there is you

192
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:54,570
know

193
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,710
mushi rock up there which just look
different from resin we didn't think

194
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,750
anything of it

195
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,810
on on to the peaks no

196
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,700
and then that rose in the is a flat roof
so

197
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,790
drain dreams basically out

198
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,449
normal drainage system and so water in
their froze

199
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,589
pushed out the service can and then once
the water melted

200
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,839
including all the water on the roof it
came out the service

201
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,779
and about half a foot away from our
primary iraq we had one rack at that

202
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:26,529
time

203
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,779
so about half away from Iraq one was
johnnie

204
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,710
and now so you want to be careful about

205
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,020
even though you can't see you know these
are some tell-tale sign

206
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,420
might indicate a problem the other thing
to consider is

207
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,270
what former heating the building has and
what former cool in the building has

208
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,760
the first place we looked at tipsy was a
really really me

209
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
%uh old IBM buildings on Austral girders

210
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,839
use power buses and everything until we
discovered that

211
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,690
its stonewalls small windows and

212
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,970
no central heating system at all the
only way to heat it would've been

213
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:03,970
electric

214
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,149
baseboard heaters running of our power
bill

215
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,070
I think account without as like three
thousand dollars per month

216
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,460
just electricity to operate enough
heaters to keep that place

217
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,029
he did I don't remember how I keep

218
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,210
no we we have radiator for ours im we
have the same sort of thing like it's

219
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,570
all breaks

220
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,089
radiators works really well but trying
to call it down

221
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,240
yes we have fifteen foot ceilings

222
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,850
and wall units sometimes just don't cut
it we have one

223
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,899
12,000 BTU air conditioner

224
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:41,970
and while there really kinda cools it
down a little bit

225
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,360
it doesn't come close to really
providing the cornice the from

226
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,100
two racks of servers running on
thankfully for us our electricity bill

227
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,399
doesn't seem to go out no matter how
much more

228
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,610
the add-ons yours we've gotten all
factory

229
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:00,210
where there are a lot of seamstresses so
they're

230
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,600
heavy duty equipment running all the
time there's like

231
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,110
syriza 200 amp breakers down

232
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,860
in the basement so we had to it all the
time and it seems worked out well

233
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,940
but if you're not lucky enough to have
that then

234
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,800
electricity costs for calling can really
cripple your

235
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,010
yeah we know we know all about that
Cambridge Massachusetts that so

236
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,290
are tough she's electric bills

237
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,099
sometimes definitely they left us

238
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,029
marquee sorta realize it's going in but

239
00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:38,080
much to electric heaters

240
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,290
machines interested calling in the
summer

241
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,529
its very difficult for a while using
little portable a/c units

242
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:51,740
I would recommend stay away from us is
there really not designed to have the

243
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,910
exhaust or the out-take whatever
extended also after going through about

244
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,380
three of those contacted a professional

245
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,930
HVAC guy it's pretty cool

246
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,680
if you find the right kind of person
they can so used here you achieve so

247
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,820
ended up getting a 30,000 BTU

248
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,140
to care much for the call summer cost
about as much as

249
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,449
for just the right person

250
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:19,560
definitely if you're looking at try to
talk it out

251
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,300
here utility bills for water

252
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,870
down with will be before you you know
jump into it sign

253
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,690
his for big data centers I think the
largest cost item is actually which is

254
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,130
not being

255
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,899
yeah that's true and it's getting worse
because Obama all these rack-mount

256
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:38,920
servers

257
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,740
realize the density get smaller Heathrow
this is amazing

258
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,089
in Poughkeepsie now we have gas heat in
the winter which

259
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:50,500
we rarely turn on at this point because
we just beat the system there the room

260
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,410
with all the computers

261
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,610
and than during the summer we have a
18,000 BTU wall unit

262
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,279
and then to 12,000 BTU stand-alone units
just for the server room

263
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,200
and it barely keeps up it should be said
to you that it seems like from talking

264
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,589
with a lot of people

265
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:10,830
this there's mobile units actually

266
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,959
seem to provide a lot less generated for

267
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,690
on they suck yes so so if you if you're
buying at 12,000 BTU

268
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,560
mobile unit expected to put out a lot
less than 12,000

269
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,050
is there also twice as expensive yeah
they are i mean they just

270
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,420
don't really seem worthwhile if you can
get a place with Windows

271
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,080
large enough to accommodate some larger
African wall unit air conditioning

272
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,860
on there's there are far better in terms
of efficiency

273
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,130
we had to go with the stand-alone units
because our server room has no

274
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:45,730
Windows so we've had them directly into
the attic

275
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,330
the attic fortunately is is pretty much
opened a ritz

276
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,790
its orbital where house you'd

277
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,540
home so we're talking about

278
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:59,930
cooling & Electric our

279
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,640
the space pieces that we are so getting
electricity from

280
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,709
the guys we ran from so we pay a static

281
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:10,810
two hundred dollars a month no matter
how much we use pretty much

282
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:14,670
so lucky yeah how does that compare to
you

283
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,709
that seems to be the case for us a case
for you yeah

284
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:21,120
like I said there's there's a lot power
coming

285
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,740
and we plug in things all the time

286
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,420
and nobody ever seems to notice an HP so
is the power bill in your name urs it in

287
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,330
the

288
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,480
least the place releasing from I believe
it's in the owner's name i'd have to

289
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,950
double check on that but I'm fairly
certain that that's the case

290
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,680
know and Cambridge again actually fairly
sore SF

291
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,100
our ability few months but if you find a
pic metropolitan area

292
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,839
I would look at your factory space it
that's included a lease but

293
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,850
are 42 much on this but look at the
different options that your electric

294
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,899
company provides and frites you figure
out a way to swing

295
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:01,240
the lowest one certain means

296
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,040
commercially zoned space there's over
there too with major ways

297
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,909
metering power as I understand it
there's the how much power using

298
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,970
demand for the entire month and then
there's so much power using any given

299
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,720
moment

300
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,150
for the entire in there's a slight
difference there

301
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,370
you guys are you guys on this little one
hour

302
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,890
we have in store on Boston and they

303
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,299
have two different plans residential
demand planner demand plan set up for

304
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:27,750
more

305
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,830
like people that use so much and stuff
like that

306
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,460
as a huge rush AC motor exxon

307
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,549
yeah are building that were in
Poughkeepsie is leader of

308
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:43,870
that it's an old bowling alley and it's
currently full day Cement Company

309
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,470
so they get metered by peak usage which
means

310
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:51,230
they basically don't notice that were
there using their power

311
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,840
%uh if you go to try to figure out where
your pal power bill is going to be

312
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,020
should probably come up with a number
and then at least double it

313
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,799
we look at all of our equipment and not
counting the air conditioner

314
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,809
on the 244 line that we can't measure

315
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:11,120
we yes to me were running something in
the city 5,000 kilowatt hours per month

316
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,870
which with the it's a lot of power we
should be a significant

317
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,080
bill I don't even calculate that there
we've got this little

318
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,280
handy dandy me to call the Q law K

319
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,970
bash a dash to view ATT I think
ThinkGeek sells on the amp started

320
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,510
sewing

321
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,320
here you can also use a multimeter with
an improved

322
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,809
yes but only if you separate out the way
3 on it so you have a space

323
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,928
yes some people on what you do with that

324
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,220
a couple things the first thing you want
to do do that with stuff that we found

325
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,250
that that works to trial

326
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,720
is aside a function teach person one
person will be in charge

327
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,450
you know with the landlord be a liaison
for that on personal be a treasure

328
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:57,059
back-up personnel personally take care
network operations a personal take care

329
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,570
you know fiscal of least in our place we

330
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,299
do a routine cleaning schedule at most
people don't think about that but it's

331
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,250
really important

332
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,340
is place we'll get really nasty really
fast

333
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,000
you don't have someone clean the Florida
batter whatever so

334
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,370
we find on just havin monthly schedule
usually works

335
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,580
yes stick with that were slightly less
well-defined keep see about that

336
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,689
but a we look at where some of the
cleaning is done by the cleaning service

337
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,120
that

338
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,350
the company that leased space from hires
veterans are insured area

339
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,230
but for the rest of it when it's time to
clean weekend just call everyone say

340
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,700
show up and we're going to for a buncha
crap out if you don't show up

341
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,880
your crap like it from now yet we're
pretty much the same way

342
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,280
we have a shared facilities as well so
luckily we don't have to clean up after

343
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,360
everyone else which is pretty nice but
when it comes down the cleaning the

344
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:48,910
inside

345
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,880
space it becomes rather difficult to get
everybody around

346
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,100
so unit meeting times

347
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,600
we have concrete floors obviously worked
ok Rico no

348
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,530
even before that we have that concrete
floors and I'm constantly amazed how

349
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:03,990
much

350
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,230
actual dirt gets on those floors if you
look on any

351
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,520
anyone at your desk for those of us were

352
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,168
roads under desks it is it's actually
like a note that you can

353
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:17,179
you can scrape with your finger new in
there's actual

354
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:21,010
depth to it it's kinda

355
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,270
unless you actually market every week or
something

356
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,799
unit do so think

357
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,230
it's just really really attend remember
actually

358
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,380
the room that we we inhabit used to be a
show for concrete

359
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,700
so we had to do was basically take we
took book it's

360
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,549
water threw it on the ground we pushed
it out before we moved anything yet so

361
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,129
we were

362
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,230
by any means clean it when you first get
in there to

363
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,280
as much as you possibly can if you can
afford it to air filtration systems like

364
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,260
have the filters

365
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,610
on even know when you're in your case
you probably have to change them fairly

366
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,340
frequently

367
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,230
very far are very nice do about once
every two weeks for a place where the

368
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,110
furnace filters

369
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:08,230
we we have a special exhaust fan exhaust
into the server

370
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,549
and goes through a filter in this field
is clogged

371
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:16,040
about two weeks yeah one thing that's
funny about concrete which

372
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,639
I didn't realize at least here other
people probably knew when I just

373
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,360
still concrete plus

374
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,890
water equals caustic to metal which is a
problem in computer

375
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:31,000
so filtering out

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,919
stuff became very very important for us
very quickly after we started to see

377
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,260
still although I don't think we've
actually seen things we we fail

378
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,929
I blew a power supply here the the other
thing that can be very funny concrete

379
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:44,049
dust will do is collect

380
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:47,230
on all the services that are supposed to
be

381
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,650
heat sinks and so on and so forth just
inhibit

382
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,700
is not just concrete dust though our
chances are you're probably getting a

383
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,309
building that is brand new

384
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,600
so chances are there's going to be a lot
of dust falling from everywhere

385
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,970
so you need to plan to take care of that
and you'll probably want a plan about

386
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,340
air filters wanna concrete justice
particularly pervasive and fine

387
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,070
but any old building any industrial
space is going to be full of dirt

388
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:14,159
gonna get into servers and what not if
you don't put in air filters

389
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,440
a in our case we maintain positive
pressure in the server room

390
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,049
so that we exhaust and so that a minimal
amount of dust comes in since there's no

391
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:27,120
direct connection from the server the
concrete factory people

392
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,600
we haven't done it yet but um one thing
you can do to cut down on does

393
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,200
done this at work is to it a concrete
sealer get

394
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,970
people whatever put it on a bare
concrete floors that just basically

395
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,840
keeps the

396
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,059
any dust from rising from the floor ft

397
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:45,600
shoes covered you drop a heavy surf

398
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,140
some answer free

399
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,750
it so one thing to keep people there
sounds

400
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,130
it's good to schedule a weekly meeting
really stick to it say

401
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,220
okay we're gonna meet every Wednesday
night 8 o'clock make sure we should

402
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,340
and that that's come the 18 where it's

403
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,250
other other things you should think
about are like their policies and

404
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:15,320
policies on someone leaves whatever
usually ask for like personalized

405
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,889
but so if you have a visitor policy it's
good to have phone

406
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,700
you know one night a week where we get
together to work on a project clean the

407
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,650
place

408
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,510
work on infrastructure something like
that and just not have rendered people

409
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,809
come over to drink

410
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:30,750
where on really can't stress enough that
it's really important to just

411
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:35,130
say okay certain things need to get done
to get done once a week

412
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:38,620
that's pretty much the in that that work
pretty well

413
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,660
if you include food people seem to come
yes really

414
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,169
you get together dinner then to work on
a project afterwards

415
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:48,419
yeah along those lines on

416
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,400
having some there is a space in every
look at their own work area for stuff

417
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,870
but then

418
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:55,770
having clear to find separation in the
common area every just things out

419
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,929
have a video projector couch couple
video games ever

420
00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:03,590
its complete separated from people's
work space is pretty important

421
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:09,428
for quite a few reasons having a server
in completely separated of

422
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:12,679
is also kinda nice on when you're jammin
in a bunch

423
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:16,120
sheets together as many as you know it
gets pretty friggin Wow

424
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,280
on and so being able to have a public
area where you can

425
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,840
and get away from all that noise is
really nice

426
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,189
when we move into our space there is a
serviceable cage area these teasers

427
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:32,750
to shit home eventually what we ended up
doing was what we try to put up this

428
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,520
stupid thankful in order to to dampen
the sound that actually worked pretty

429
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,429
well

430
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:42,750
we thought and we had a more machines
she's we got more sensitive to issued

431
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,890
much noise so we certainly she rocking
well

432
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,370
that was great on and then we put more

433
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,520
insulation in their league actually or

434
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,780
15 insulation with fiberglass insulation
fiberglass insulation

435
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,928
any other where she rockin then that's
what we got elements

436
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:04,299
rei it's too loud some places

437
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:07,480
because government vento so

438
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,980
rate so one thing bud can talk about
what she touches down with a minute

439
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,220
that's been important

440
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,429
on the workspaces those involved in
Boston rented a place

441
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,820
that we can get the assault or anything
to it

442
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,049
so we had a space about three months we
had to leave the least because

443
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:25,150
can get it down spree week couldn't
really use it for

444
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,080
is intended purposes so on two different
options to pay or you live for looking

445
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,460
up in Boston to

446
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,929
departed a cough cough realized who
pretty much runner church guys

447
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,850
to help offset the cost I think all the
work spaces do this is offer

448
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,299
like web hosting a co services preachy

449
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,340
have people you trust me I'm in 10
machines

450
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:52,340
a netbook for them that that's good
income to help us at the ballot

451
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,130
was a time you gonna want to go with the
commercial this all service specially if

452
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:55,990
you know you have people

453
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,320
thank you to see you get a good sooo
don't try to do something with

454
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,870
cable chief DSL or something like that

455
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,059
yeah arm we look at getting an official
t want

456
00:26:07,059 --> 00:26:10,440
tipsy and thanks to the lack of

457
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,710
any tech companies for the most part
except IBM

458
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,179
in the Cape see arm at1 would have cost

459
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,390
up about nine hundred dollars a month

460
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,640
it's a big expense that's more than yeah
so what we ended up getting was a

461
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,750
commercial DSL line as well

462
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,190
and we lucked out because there's a

463
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:33,289
non Verizon on phone company DSL

464
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:37,080
company in Poughkeepsie so we're one of
their largest commercial customers so

465
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,030
they tend to like us

466
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:42,559
which is really beneficial you have any
problems with your with airlines

467
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,389
there was a guy we suppose that you
present at this conference you could

468
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,210
make it

469
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,720
on who did a lot of skinny a lot of
things

470
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,970
most eyes peas wages but the collage
home

471
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:58,480
they called us up first and say well
what's happening with this guy seems to

472
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,510
be doing this you

473
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,500
and I can actually talk to them and
explain to them what exactly was

474
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,430
happening

475
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,320
is a girl okay well you know we're
getting complaints this that and the

476
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,770
other thing

477
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,160
and he could finish is researching

478
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,780
he ended up finishing his research so
having a friendly company

479
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,870
a person you means that you can call
this exists at

480
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,910
larger companies to but unless you're be
commercial customer

481
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:27,550
you generally don't get that level of
attention the guys don't know you too

482
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:27,960
well

483
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,430
finding the smallest he talking to them

484
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,610
at a time showing the house include huge

485
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,440
work more probably yet demonstrating

486
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,370
cool for missus really good if you can
talk to their text directly up

487
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,260
we were lucky enough we even got reverse
DNS delegation %uh when we first asked

488
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,910
about it they went no because

489
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,160
people we screwed up in the other server
dns is broken and were actually able to

490
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,400
persuade them that we're not

491
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,400
stupid and we lucked out in there

492
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,970
as well that would never happen if we
done yourself Verizon or something like

493
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,370
that

494
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:07,370
it also helps if you on wanted okay sure
something like that justified

495
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:11,360
we gotta after class see for ourselves I
guess you you have

496
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,560
you own your own see sure you can sort
of

497
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,000
we we take have a classy from your ISP

498
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,640
on I remember when when the they come to
install it for commercial customers

499
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,990
there's really nothing you can do

500
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,930
to prevent them from coming to install
so they sent along this guy who just

501
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,980
happen to be living

502
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:33,080
in the direction we were on his way home
and

503
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,710
he was a dork he was a UNIX admin for
the company

504
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,630
they were small enough that the UNIX
admin also that installs every once in a

505
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,350
while so he came

506
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,530
he sold redoing he was really

507
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,470
how often would you ever imagine rag-tag
group for people in this

508
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,420
concrete factory nerding it up with all
sorts computers

509
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,110
so he was amazed and and turns out that
he's the actual does the Riverstone

510
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,610
nations so gave him a call-up and and he
hoped that sounds ok result couple

511
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:02,480
problems since

512
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,080
wanna the when the coup for people
israel's was a building with how much

513
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,460
being with you actually keep which doing

514
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,780
how much do you need how much determine
running two teams

515
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,110
for you well

516
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,130
again that's situation get preachy

517
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,570
return it ourselves farewell

518
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,919
touch other families here two years ago
Cambridge now its REM

519
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,080
it's a group of people Boston this

520
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,320
said okay work pretty fed up with all
the sites teasers costar so

521
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,990
but to the whole company today we have
10 people but he wants you know by 10 I

522
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:43,650
want

523
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,860
fast where we get a lot like 5-10
dollars over cost

524
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:52,520
their termination fees you looks like
the space to look at the physical plant

525
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,639
around the space

526
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,600
the coppers horrible you know schools
are showing up whatever you call you

527
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,140
have a lot our time DSL

528
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,000
their frequent your office building as
fiber to

529
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,370
going to like this or something like
that it's free a definite plus

530
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,720
so if you're looking to purchase basis
of if we look at the first one to see

531
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,330
look at 56 basis crisis is a good place
to look just running around your city or

532
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:16,850
whatever

533
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,040
performance on this just keep table
what's good

534
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,980
what features space everyone leave

535
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,170
its kinda nice if you're in a and major
city

536
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,170
to the near public transportation as
well

537
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,720
were kinda rate of the subway and so you
know it's a quick trip down there

538
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,090
people who don't have cars can get there
easily without having to pay

539
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,800
you know taxi fares one and its it's
pretty nice

540
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,690
general I think we went we when we were
looking we went

541
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,060
just tool was not the whole group users
like his or

542
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:54,399
6 I think originally there about 10
people its first tentative interest

543
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,550
and you know we end up now with 1234

544
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,020
for about six people were and

545
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,820
so just the two of us got in the car and
drove around until we found stuff

546
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,689
near us that was pretty big about the
right copied on the phone numbers to

547
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,130
Publix your pictures

548
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,110
picture weir's actually when contacted
them two pictures inside

549
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,929
shouldn't everybody and a we all went
out the biggest

550
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,470
the best with where we were

551
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,630
if you're in a more rural area it might
be worth your time to investigate

552
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,080
how or rather where the telco

553
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,949
switching stations are City make sure
you get close enough to DSL

554
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,290
the first place we looked at we could
literally open a window for a rockin

555
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,120
AT&T

556
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,970
it was the bigger ok no we didn't that's
a place that we couldn't afford the

557
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:47,060
yeah North single

558
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,090
will probably take questions for the end
if you wanna keep standing the whole

559
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,530
time

560
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,850
you well we weren't 33 minutes past the
hour

561
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,190
from can we spend but say three minutes
talking

562
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:00,460
require stuff and then and they will
head to

563
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,600
so pictures and stuff and then to
questions

564
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,900
hope 10-15 is a question years so

565
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,950
home how did you decide what you needed

566
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,669
and how did you acquire all the crap I
think the key word is

567
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:17,210
grift yes I

568
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,120
there's an amazing quantity of free
stuff out there check out the local

569
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,820
colleges especially in without days

570
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:27,020
I'm working for local universities
discrete to

571
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,090
they seem to have a lot of turnover in
things on

572
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,620
at least in pennsylvania it costs a lot
to recycle your computer's

573
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:38,890
so if you work for a local university
talk to your manager more often than not

574
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,260
you know they'll have to sign a paper
that says you're not responsible for

575
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:42,800
office

576
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,540
here and you can walk home with older
son servers

577
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,810
what's a Dell gear on occasional network
switcher too

578
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,730
and I mean all that just absolutely for
free

579
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,860
with a lot of furniture from our local
university

580
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,150
home when they were throwing out to all
the all guests from a computer lab

581
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,730
just piled up in a warehouse or I'm so
anywhere

582
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,810
so we for the whole bunch desks is

583
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:14,530
space worked out really well is actually
amazing when we started to space and we

584
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,510
talked to everybody we knew even people
who were actually involved

585
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,410
how many people just came forward with
hey you wanna couch %ah

586
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,800
here's a rack things like that which is

587
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,210
well I Q the first coat you had already
yet but then there is

588
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:33,280
to catch is that came after that me with
a partial

589
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:37,418
knows those those his account said no

590
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:40,570
it you have to get up from the couch

591
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,620
um so furniture

592
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,870
everything we have any other tips on the
university's

593
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,870
on well you know there's always
Craigslist there's local garage sales

594
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,220
for things like furniture

595
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,500
it's helpful if someone you know has
pickup truck

596
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,410
because it's easy to take a ride around
on you know Saturday or Sunday to

597
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,570
local thrift shop for what I you buy it
so

598
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:08,850
for like 50 bucks so that's pretty known
this coz there's the MIT Swami

599
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,710
yeah I found a while UPS's and some
computer we'll keep a lot of computer

600
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:14,000
equipment that's communal

601
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,609
aside the stuff that's been there so
long which uses

602
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:20,739
so we found like for your UPS's

603
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,220
and those actually last was replaced the
batteries

604
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:29,710
which is expense we were out we were
lucky enough we got are to me

605
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,929
UPS's which are right now UPS's

606
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:38,970
2200 for free on there was a mistake in
order and they can return

607
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,399
so it's helpful if you're known as the
guy who will take

608
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,830
any bit of hardware that comes your way
whether you're gonna keep it or whether

609
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,359
or not you're gonna throw it out

610
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,739
if everyone knows that you'll take it
damn when they have something to get rid

611
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,649
of their gonna come to you for it

612
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:56,290
on and so thats really really been
helpful

613
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:00,090
it's gone so missed everything I don't
we haven't bought much that's actually

614
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:01,400
brand new

615
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
aside from maybe some access points

616
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,800
our core router double-edge sword though
sometimes you end up with a walk

617
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,050
yeah you'll see that the pictures yeah
speaking of which your way

618
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,350
move along to their careers one quick
tips on acquiring network hardware

619
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,380
if you can give the techno house if you
look on ebay there's

620
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:24,500
so much network equipment that's forty
LTC

621
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,940
you can get yourself DC regulator

622
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,960
rectifier preachy find network routers
or switches you get them

623
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,550
maybe a third at their cost if you're
willing to user

624
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,990
especially left over from people

625
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,640
cookie that stuff tokars its it's really
cheap

626
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,230
yourself 24 switch 50 bucks

627
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,500
is also if you look for some the off
brand stuff

628
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,600
Nick pointed us when we started our
space towards Cajun equipment

629
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,420
which has been made for a while but
we're using it and its

630
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,359
pretty much as good as Cisco's far as
we're concerned because everything we

631
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,390
need to and

632
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:06,200
parts to replace anything embraces free
pretty easily

633
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,580
stop with the management face you says

634
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,410
making your face in those things

635
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,569
it's with some pitchers kinda the kinda

636
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:24,570
touch on some stuff we talked about talk
about

637
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:28,380
answers picture keeps the space from
just before we moved in

638
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,299
are just before we got there they're
using it as a storage area

639
00:36:32,299 --> 00:36:36,970
for you its you also notice the

640
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:43,970
interesting water damage that we didn't
pay attention to and

641
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:48,308
that's when it got turned into as binary
pointed out leader

642
00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:51,349
try to create a bit of a division
between where you hang out and where you

643
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,109
work so

644
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:55,240
from that perspective all the tests in
the servers in one hour behind us

645
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,950
her behind the the camera so we keep
where people are just hanging around

646
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,690
chatting

647
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,359
probably good 20 feet away from where
people are trying to work which cuts

648
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:03,940
down on some

649
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:10,109
no reason overflow like that and

650
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:13,880
that's just an example love cheap ways
to mount racks %ah

651
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,119
go get it for by foreign cut in half at
Home Depot to cut in half for you I

652
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:19,150
think we paid about

653
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:22,249
30 bucks for the rack mounts and

654
00:37:22,249 --> 00:37:27,980
nothing for the racks so as great if you
can sit on the floor you on Israel for

655
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,700
post you really do have to secure those
the floor we're using user

656
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:36,180
you know be a service these are two post
0 X the actual handle it iraq's or

657
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,249
strong enough to do that

658
00:37:37,249 --> 00:37:41,009
but you do need to get them onto the
floor really well and even in this case

659
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,460
you can you can sort of pushing

660
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,880
walls it so if you're an earthquake

661
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,089
think but ago

662
00:37:49,089 --> 00:37:52,119
yet defeat there are four feet long to
give an idea of how much

663
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:57,029
balance actually also just a a general
though

664
00:37:57,029 --> 00:38:00,730
you probably should ground iraq's a lot
of people

665
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:04,730
do that by when before we had grounded
racks

666
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,410
and when I was a certain grounding into
the racks

667
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,098
I did notice that there was a difference
for some reason that just made me think

668
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:14,759
OVA

669
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:18,559
now I for think about 5

670
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:23,289
I'm I'm really tired he CC right just
since those diagramming a sec ago

671
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,349
you see there's two lines coming in from
the from the right there

672
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:30,279
and they're going down to a black thing
and that's that's actually or ground

673
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,809
we've got that big giant loop

674
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,829
like a laptop gone all the way back to

675
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:39,190
to ground stake that so real hard ground
we paid make sure

676
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,309
200 bucks for yeah should make sure from
the

677
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,450
people you least from what their
policies are earning more power in our

678
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:46,339
case then you know it

679
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:49,819
they do an electrician at work on the
side so we were able to

680
00:38:49,819 --> 00:38:52,839
save a little money there and they're
pretty flexible about

681
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:57,170
running heavy condo cable for their
feelings and what not drilling holes in

682
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:57,690
the walls

683
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,019
but if you don't have a place that
flexible you need to make sure you have

684
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:02,160
enough power there already

685
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,848
you may not be able to add more we've
got 3 30 amp circuits

686
00:39:06,849 --> 00:39:12,099
3 20 amp circuits 1234 28 Nov 3 2010
circuits

687
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:17,749
and to 30 answer yet or in just for the
servers not counting people's desks

688
00:39:17,749 --> 00:39:21,680
and the air conditioner for the name
this picture here

689
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,399
is the other two well news almost
because the two air conditioners the

690
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,749
12,000 BTU or one time for those which
used

691
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:35,720
so that's two tones air conditioning
theoretically home

692
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,549
one thing we should know from there or

693
00:39:39,549 --> 00:39:43,640
will clear plastic tubes that are
heading down those the condensate oops

694
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,239
on the emptied into a bucket the book
was on a scale

695
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,369
skills attached to an email address
which page does whatever the street with

696
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:56,079
brisket think

697
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,170
if we also had MRTG grass and everything
set up so that you could see

698
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,519
for the skew hopeful the book it was
insane you when you had to go

699
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,470
into you if that lasted about three
weeks before we realize were empty the

700
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,239
bucket every

701
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,789
hours yeah I was nothing better than
getting woken up for the morning to go

702
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:16,089
into the air positive get a long look at
this isn't like a small little this is

703
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:17,200
the big honkin

704
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,450
anyway home humid times sometime

705
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:24,339
might i remember humid plus concrete
equals

706
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:28,328
me um I think it's all

707
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:34,470
say about picture with little services
though wanna

708
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,039
factory in Philly on and some other
things that we tried to do

709
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,460
were build utilitarian desks that could
be used for

710
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,839
electronics work for you know said
laptops or desktops

711
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:51,970
and being able to you have a fairly open
area where people could just fly again

712
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,250
and you know there were some spaces that
want to claim as their own but the rest

713
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,779
space is pretty much open

714
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:01,809
first come first serve on you see the
two racks

715
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,000
of to the center into the race and
there's

716
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,390
were just moved in they were donated to
us on and we're trying to keep them as

717
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,089
far apart so that we can keep

718
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:16,480
the sound out at that as much as
possible

719
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,009
isn't that the tabletop a whiteboard
yeah oh yeah I'm sorry actually

720
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:24,029
from Home Depot I you can get tabletop
that acts as a way forward

721
00:41:24,029 --> 00:41:28,160
on so if you don't really have wall
space to hang a way forward

722
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,629
it's nice to just be able to jot down
notes on the table and know that you can

723
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:38,630
actually a race from later

724
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:43,160
so I this picture was thrown and simply
because if you look at the door

725
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,470
on you may see something that looks
familiar to you and it's probably

726
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,690
something that every good

727
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:51,890
hackerspace should have on that's a
picture of Captain Crunch that states

728
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,868
cities watching you

729
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:58,259
who %ah we had shared bathroom so we
could really keep it in there because it

730
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,480
tended to flee a lot of people out but

731
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,519
is kinda fun to have nonetheless

732
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:08,009
but also you could use a store space
metal racks

733
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:15,009
lot of companies those

734
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:18,049
%ah so this is an example of how easily

735
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:23,920
John can actually acquire on we don't
tend to throw out a whole lot without

736
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,359
all bunch of pushing on so we recently
went through a major clean and sweet and

737
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:33,828
everything in this picture pretty much
wind up being thrown out

738
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:39,170
on in in pennsylvania you can either
drive to the ghetto and drop it off in

739
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:42,209
some street corner you actually have to
pay to have a recycled

740
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:46,379
so it's something to think about as
you're gathering here

741
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,789
because it's like twenty dollars per
computer to have a recycle

742
00:42:49,789 --> 00:42:54,519
make sure you ever get a nearby or they
already

743
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:59,099
in the ghetto shark as this is a just a
quick picture showing on

744
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,640
is the pastry in Boston our division
culinary in workspace re-election a

745
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,459
separate or

746
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:07,868
still there on city level security
seeking

747
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:11,880
people can hang out for without
disturbing anything

748
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,309
it's going on and other world I appear

749
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:23,249
gonna ask freak out sometimes and
culture this is well

750
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:26,650
we are final solution our air
conditioning our server area was

751
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,890
said we are called around we found hace
goes to a willing to work on the side

752
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,368
any soul this this commercial a/c unit
that was pulled out of an office

753
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:35,880
building

754
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,400
was working large condenser unit outside

755
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,380
came from Leichhardt university or
something like that he sold it was very

756
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,589
very cheap if you ever seen the movie
Brazil

757
00:43:44,589 --> 00:43:48,099
on your mind me a lot of very title
especially with this

758
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:52,729
whatever the hell those things called
over here on our works pretty well in a

759
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:53,349
bikini

760
00:43:53,349 --> 00:43:56,989
it's actually because it's so large it's
much more efficient does the compressors

761
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:58,289
and you to run nearly as much as

762
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:04,119
no reason for the units Texas Health our
electric bill and this is a rare picture

763
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:05,089
of minus

764
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:09,299
enjoying the view this is a for space
those involved

765
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:16,299
hitting pictures

766
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,980
I think so go to questions I think we

767
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:26,310
minutes line up at the Mikes and

768
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:33,310
ask your question perspective apparently
very short person that was also a

769
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,200
you use that Mike hit that my go

770
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,120
okay I'll

771
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:46,589
first off track are good friend over
wants to send free to you from

772
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:47,170
Albuquerque

773
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:51,620
com but my main question is about Tom
are you guys

774
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,980
a nonprofit 501 c3

775
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:59,330
perforated you guys do anything like
that for for the organization's

776
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:02,730
we'll we looked into it in Poughkeepsie

777
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,960
and we may still do it at some point are
there some benefits in there some losses

778
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,990
to it a

779
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:11,280
it's a lot of people work you have to
have regular board meetings

780
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,410
have tested mission plans and there's
some restrictions about what happens

781
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:19,129
to the equipment you acquire as a
corporate entity when you then dissolve

782
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,240
namely if I recall you have to hand it
off to other non-profit entities

783
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,930
so if you we're trying to use 501 us

784
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,740
once I won't see three-state if you try
to use non-profit status be able to get

785
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,200
equipment

786
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,760
tax-free and other things like that then

787
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,970
can't take it with you if you break up
arm

788
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:42,160
possibles five hundred dollars for the
application to become

789
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,350
501 c3 yeah but when we're starting out
that was

790
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,900
five dollars for defrauded have on the
upside

791
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:52,780
a your nonprofit so donations you can be
written off

792
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,690
so theoretically you could try to get a
of

793
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,510
someone to donate space to you as a tax
write off I don't know that that's ever

794
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:00,930
work

795
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,200
certainly try are you might be able to
get network ran with donated or things

796
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:05,710
like that

797
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:09,030
liability works differently in get

798
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,840
insurance a lot easier their benefits
there as well

799
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,060
yeah it's a something you should you
could look into which if we do a lot of

800
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,610
reading on it because there's

801
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:22,190
a lot of subtleties to it Boston we

802
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,530
formed a partnership which gives us a
federal tax ID this file

803
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,620
LC probably be the optimal go

804
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,310
for this many reasons sort have any

805
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,900
shirts on in Philly were kinda mixer

806
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,460
so as a group word kinda loosely knit

807
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,600
and we don't any any governments

808
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,740
concert sponsored status

809
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,880
that all other networking and everything
else is currently under an LLC

810
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,640
and we do that primarily because it
gives us better rates

811
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,810
were able to get things wholesale that
way if we need to

812
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,320
we just have our offices there as well

813
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,430
trigger for through your questions yes
gotta

814
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,290
the line and not much time go ahead and
you it's not the

815
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:14,520
band with situation 381

816
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,110
19 of course we have newer systems

817
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,780
I have files somehow save 10% down to up
30 month

818
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,700
I wanna kill me here I'm ninety dollars
a month 31

819
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,110
has anything Valley because what
commercial areas that

820
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,040
it features you read your service
agreement that's a question

821
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,490
I'm unlocked I can do any part doesn't
matter I've been up yet the weather

822
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,680
as obvious service-oriented yes alerts
yeah says

823
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,910
basically on your whether or not for
profit or whatever is that was

824
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:50,819
dictating this situation you all if it's
also a complex question answer but it is

825
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,920
different tiers and different service
levels and different places you care

826
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,030
onto the internet and fire this is a
completely different animal its

827
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,850
residential

828
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,920
for things but what and has anything
come along

829
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,570
that prices have dropped because newer
technologies available to the consumer

830
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:09,710
well a lot of it has to do with her
first gets fixed

831
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:14,210
race yeah that that's makes you very
much but I don't think he

832
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,310
well especially if they're all sitting
your BAM with by

833
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:22,170
are charging other people services you
can't really do it with a residential

834
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:22,660
plan

835
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,540
you need something you gonna be able to
get on the phone and speak to someone

836
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:30,730
about when your links gonna be back know
that there's trouble shooting in place

837
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:34,420
with fires were cable or regular DSL

838
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,590
you simply not gonna get and you're
always going to have a flutter

839
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:41,100
on it's just not worth basically that up
to

840
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:44,650
yes its York Times the availability if
something happens to our line this phone

841
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,190
will ring within five minutes 90

842
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,100
if it doesn't then there's significant
fiscal penalties to the eyes peas

843
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:54,140
so we've actually been called by ISP
worry organizing our server room

844
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,770
we on for the DSL modem to move things
around and they called us and said

845
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:02,560
did something happen how's that for
certain we have only limited time

846
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,880
as much people set up their own unique
lady talking to known also Jeff

847
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,320
thank you a up too quickly that also

848
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,970
implies that you be using your link at
the space to host servers

849
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:16,390
if you just using it as a work area and
you're going to do your sir if you look

850
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,980
at your the coal facility you doing all
your hosting of

851
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,620
site then it might be much easier for
you to get a cable but

852
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,740
if you're looking to host servers
yourself or submit your band without the

853
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:26,800
need to

854
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,100
get something that lets you do that for
me it's expression

855
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:33,850
also on the ice you know if you're in a
buildings more than one or two stories

856
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:38,029
look around for a local wireless ISP is
there for mom and pops my friend cool

857
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,870
sysadmin

858
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,850
I don't know about the uptime on those I
wanna ask really what do you do when

859
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,060
when somebody in your space to something
really stupid it's the whole place rated

860
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,810
it's sitting in a warehouse next the FBI
building in Virginia

861
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:56,410
what do you do how do you Inslee
yourself legally when one-member the

862
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,480
space does something really

863
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,020
a peaceful that yes I

864
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:05,650
Gaurav pillowcase those oranges works
very well too

865
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,120
doesn't leapers I guess that's why we
really gotta be careful about

866
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:12,650
you accept and what sort of levels and
access you give them

867
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,930
on are our group is trust the key group
where we've known each other for a

868
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,190
really long time

869
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,900
and any guest access is is fairly close
that goes for any

870
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,350
any kind of working organization to I'm
in the office who work in what happens

871
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:29,700
that person that sits next to you this
is something like that how are you

872
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,700
liable

873
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,340
mean it would have to be something that
would put everybody risk

874
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,540
I think in the office situation they
going to take that

875
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,900
persons machine you know it from there
caster an organization

876
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,150
the exact same thing in the space is
that a citizen of a situation that's

877
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:45,390
basically what you're free

878
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:49,759
it doesn't look very professional
because you know you're a shoestring

879
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:55,550
its deletion of the situation is still
we should be taking and if they take

880
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:00,710
if you know they're all in the same
crackin AR warrants as any

881
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:04,070
it's a situation we haven't had to
address personally but hopefully

882
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:07,140
never will here like no other

883
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,109
with the deal number of people you
should get to share one space

884
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:14,550
all that really depends on the number
people involved in how large a space

885
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,660
you can get we find release

886
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,899
the space evidence of that we find six
or seven people

887
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:24,860
is a good number seems to be the magic
number I think we have we both have the

888
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,580
so 6 a I probably wouldn't go much
higher

889
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:33,220
one i guess i you know way like core
people versus people who come into work

890
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,090
on various projects %ah

891
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:38,420
but definitely contributing members we
have six as well

892
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,400
yeah we had the original division uva
full-time people and students

893
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,910
center right near the college we didn't
feel that we could charge them for price

894
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,049
when they don't have

895
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:51,290
a real job yet are but so we had a
number of students that would come in

896
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:53,000
and out and then we had a a

897
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,470
about five or six core people that would

898
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:00,440
pay most the bills we charged issues
very we charge a $50 bucks a month for

899
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,550
basically all the same things except for

900
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:06,330
they all shared one joint desk on 2
minutes left

901
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:12,529
next question please

902
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:17,090
could tip the mic down your sorry short

903
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:20,500
first sure

904
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,530
in this situation hits from

905
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:28,190
one just how to maintain security

906
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:31,250
between our office this

907
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,630
its

908
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:38,140
I I guess it depends on what level
security I mean

909
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:42,000
if you can put up drywall like there's
obviously visible security but that's

910
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,930
not really gonna keep people out

911
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,640
on I don't know that I would necessarily
want to share

912
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,180
a space with a law office but I mean if
you get a donated thats

913
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,480
pretty hard to turn down of into tipsy
were fairly lucky that were

914
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,360
really friendly with the people that
share the building with us where their

915
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,270
ISP

916
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:01,810
among other things that we do tech
support for them when they need it so

917
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:05,320
they leave their office door unlocked
all the time don't think about it

918
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,400
we've forgotten our inner door unlocked
and we'll think about it

919
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,730
that they accept packages for us

920
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,140
I mean you should definitely build up
their relationship with the people

921
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,390
around you is what it comes down to

922
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:19,520
if you could do drywall and put up like
a cheap a

923
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,710
actual wall there that's the best I can
think of something

924
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,790
we can talk to you more afterwards last
question

925
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,210
just get one more question and then we
gotta it out

926
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:34,020
no no question okay very well one last
question

927
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:37,340

reference that

928
