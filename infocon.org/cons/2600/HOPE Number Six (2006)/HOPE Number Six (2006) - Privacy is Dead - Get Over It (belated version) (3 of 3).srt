yeah

84
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,060
and yep

85
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,960
wall you

86
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,960

00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:38,339
yeah said

89
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:41,369
and

90
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:46,570
you

91
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:50,570
yeah okay that was weird question but

92
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,250
calls for coming and a following number
one if they have no wallet

93
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,810
shrewd beyond belief you need to be one
of the few people that actually goes

94
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,950
into the Social Security Administration

95
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,650
and gets a new social security number
you're screwed

96
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,510
somebody gets your whole wallowing and
they have half a brain they own you

97
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:13,599
a source the privacy thing let me tell
you so

98
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,310
people in Europe for its yeah

99
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,570
you know good huge what makes America
different

100
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,060
you know you can say whatever you want
about george bush to perform policies to

101
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,220
promote the policy

102
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,740
here's what makes America wonderful and
pretty much the best place they rose

103
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,100
you have a right to your whole life

104
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,930
you have a right to take control of your
own life you don't

105
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,870
give massive amounts of taxes to

106
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,100
the governor you think that I tax issue
check with the doing hollom

107
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,300
I then president dole back out to you

108
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,100
we have firearms in the United States
and they'd only in Europe

109
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,420
because america trusts its citizens with
goes

110
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,200
and so is you have a right to be able to
protect yourself without going home

111
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,050
police

112
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,590
yeah it's a whole different mindset so
school what they're doing all

113
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:11,900
and that doesn't want you that's that's
my political point of view I'm sorry but

114
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,160
I think that's that's it thoughts who
greatest thing about a month

115
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,730
you have a writing to be left alone not
a constitutional right although people

116
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,720
think it's actually

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,920
in the constitution but it's how we do
things in america

118
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,460
the fraternity guy I

119
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,020

don't have a freaking computer

133
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,900

find it amazing that something

134
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,889
that you would even be asking this
question your I don't you

146
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,070

forth

150
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,610
everything that you do you leave these
little digital footprints which we've

151
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,350
been talking about

152
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,839
some of the really really obvious as you
go through your day

153

sensible enough to know that there are

156

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,830
completely the short answer is it's
completely dismiss that it was the

226
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,500
smallest

before and i can only tell you what
happened I've had this is actually

228
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:13,100
important because it really speaks to
the new unit democracy for

229

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,780
but nevertheless it was a real guy who
was a government informant

243
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,150
nobody knew who he was

244
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,110

267
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,880
million bart's

268
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,410
I actually his reputation goes down from
what I just described

269
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,810
yeah in fact since you brought a book

270
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:51,410
slocum he reviews the principal she

271
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:56,560
a the second Boeing Gracia little

272

Austria

peeking out of his whole that's the
Prince today

274
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:10,510
and here is the prince when he started
his career

275
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:13,990
arm

276
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,270
do the same guy with the 15

277
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,119
felony history being taken away

278
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,810
for heating up his mother and putting
them opposed to getting your head

279
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,940
being taken away to a mental institution
so on and so forth when I found the so

280
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,790
assorted question family members a
reason to question his family members

281
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:36,950
first of all it's a good investigative
tactic

282
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:41,410
the several every family member who a
question so it's about time since the

283
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,750
peninsula Bigg

284
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,560
let me tell you what he did when he was
14 had them

285
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,090
certainly there for the whole day told
me as his criminal history

286
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,300
when they found out I was doing this
they convene a grand jury

287
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:59,300
and the subpoenaed my investigator for
the FBI

288
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,260
well for those of you who are lawyers or
her

289
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,560
any knowledge of the law let me tell you
you don't get investigators for

290
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,600
you can subpoena work product that's
foolish

291
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,750
so the lawyer who I was working for

292
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,240
wanted from the emergency jobs I'd like
to give you a big fat legal reform when

293
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,440
he can't do this

294
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,710
but this has never happened before in
the history of the Southern District of

295
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,180
New York

296
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,930
here or no case is ongoing been trying
to get your defense investigators for

297
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:33,000
the judges you can't do that you

298
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,320
so the FBI went to the judgment on the
kg

299
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,919

pretty much any magistrate if I just to
say you can't get up

303
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,000
skies an investigator is not over

304
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,470

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,190
they have they have bounced the
prosecutor water on schools

313
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,410
I mean there is somebody with the bottom
well

314
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,450
couple days after that they figured they
would make their point so they found a

315
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,070
place where I would be speaking

316
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:51,120
to 1100 people your I'm thinking in
seven games with ray jackets and took me

317
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,110
another

318
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,580
now in the federal system you have
you're arrested

319
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,379
and then they have to induction you have
to be indicted this the cases to go for

320
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,750
original

321
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,990
well what an hour before the grand jury
II

322
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,970
I you don't know the guy if this to bonn
you don't

323
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,880
for one hour before New York they
decided we're going to

324
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,750
not george was thrown so all charges
dropped

325
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:25,290
three weeks later they have me charged
again from californian

326
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,800
the exact same complaint work for all
they did was change the FBI agents

327
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,910
name and again

328
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,590
one how long before they were supposed
to indict me the drug of choice

329
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:42,060
so I probably have a Guinness Book of
World Records

330
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,399
record you know arrested most times
without indictment doing one love

331
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,560
something like that the point was they
were trying to tie me up and create a

332
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,780
situation where could not just you

333
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:57,190

when I dole's a party came in and said
no no no you can't do this

335
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:06,550
the prosecutor was booted out said to
her was given a deal is not go to jail

336
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,740
all charges against me were dropped my

he is though most since those or

367
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,790
under the radar I mean you wanna do you
in the head once you have no idea what's

368
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,480
going on

369
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,929
people don't accurately tell you house
whom you're gonna be

373
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,149

classes I'm zones

374
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,260
people who log or viable

375
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,429
Amazon makes money think don't keep a
record of the purchase

376
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,929
after it's actually been delivered to
your home there's no need

377
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:45,630
that would be the other classes people
who don't care

378
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,530
yes they have a 20-year listen
everything you've ever read

379
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,309
were expressed interest um I think when
I was on was doing is

380
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:58,600
is a bush I think it's on us that's not
a political opinion that's a

381
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,340
professional

382
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:05,080
your you can reward you can be all about
anything the last thing I want I mean

383
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,100
the only way to make things worse is
involved US government

384
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:12,980
the was that every situation I i think
that there has to be

385
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,090
a consumer-driven

386
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:20,820
movement where you were you gravitate
towards the people

416
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,889
single instance in the United States

417
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:29,549
where somebody was court and prosecute

418
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:34,019
as a result of information that would
not be available

419
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,499
had not been approached a picture

420
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:40,929
I'm not aware the single

421
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:44,029
R Us not warm now

422
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,659
I gotta tell you I'm very happy to say
the US government doesn't mean daily

423
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:48,350
briefing

424
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,570
book by know what hurts so

425
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,299
with everybody vision about the
patriarch they would've trotted out

426
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,580
really good example

427
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,918
phone their is no you know everyone's
talking about all we have to have the

428
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:02,480
lime

429
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,309
to download telephone databases so we
can do

430
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:10,999
data mining and see who talked to who
you could be here right now

431
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:15,799
your go to the phone company you say
give me everybody who's been talking dog

432
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:17,210
because three months

433
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,249
new effect the NYPD which does not use

434
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:26,239
Patriot Act provisions if they don't
somebody made a phone call

435
00:27:26,239 --> 00:27:29,940
from a payphone thinking every incoming
and outgoing call

436
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,549
think you know it is just

437
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:37,039
in my opinion of professional

438
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,249
investigative billion perhaps a loose
him all

439
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:44,840
absolutely there is not a single bit of
information you can gather

440
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,440
onto the page you know that you can't
get without on do

441
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,039
so the laws that existed prior to 2000

442
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,570
you don't not 11 2001 also is all what's
changed he is

443
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,668
sharing the information among
governmental agencies which is also saw

444
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:03,200
an assault on your privacy

445
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,279
but it's one that's just the phone the
example for once we were going larger

446
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:12,580
as is is an excellent example up but as
far as

447
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,009
giving the government additional she
knew being a building

448
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:21,210
they've got the maximum they've ever
needed and I don't know who use

449

00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:22,509
a motel address their own

481
00:30:22,509 --> 00:30:25,830

was all legal research in addition to
that

624

something that I don't have

627
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,530
a legitimate need to write a reason to
do so and

628
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:49,400
frankly I can see you follow what the
caller is what she this is this is not

629
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,650
england where

630

enough to hire an attorney in my

633
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,780
liability insurance rates to OpenSSL
modssl course

634
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,150
be addressed the issue LifeBook that's a
legal reasons

635
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:21,150
yahoo.com from most people go to private
investigation

636
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:27,250
or not Thomas Magnum or more most people
go to private investigation

637
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:31,430
have significant number three years
behind them

638
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,819
in one criminal justice field win over
or perhaps the reporters

639
00:40:35,819 --> 00:40:39,420
in states that what you qualify that
with these are people who

640
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,640
I've got it so you aren't typically
interested in making the world a better

641
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,470
place

642
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:48,640
that's why they're in the feel I don't
know of a single problem first year of

643
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,220
work with local to move

644
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,980
the pro bono issues so screw think most
people who see it as a predawn

645
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,339
ethical be arm Franklin

646
00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:03,349
I'm not saying this was my personal
circumstances

647
00:41:03,349 --> 00:41:06,970
i've seen more problems switch forum

648
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,270
law enforcement officers who get lazy
the

649
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:15,960
private investigators okay something
else is a big problem

650
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,369
for law enforcement officers when they
go private because they don't have that

651
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:20,460
bitch anymore

652
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,950
you can say up detective Jones answer
these questions

653
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,930
they have to come in and be inventive
would be slower get the information

654
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,720
this big learning curve and it's a big
adjustment um

655
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,349
the cops the were lazy and behaved
improperly

656
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:42,210
lose their licenses within the first
year in the same Texas for example

657
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:45,619
were is very very easy to become a law
enforcement official

658
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:49,470
up but it's not so easy to supply was a
problem just you know

659
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:53,319
one-third of PRI's give up their
licenses every year

660
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:57,050
one-third of the industry goes out of
business over your

661
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,390
I've been licensed in Texas for 22 years
when I go in there

662
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:03,629
milo license number people think its
anti-people

663
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,390
honest you um so good

664
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,629
the summary of what I want to say is
there are plenty of laws preventing

665
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:17,160
there are lawyers solving the
opportunity

666
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,480
to sue somebody with a multi-million
dollar liability policy

667
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:25,990
and most people's premiums not

668
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:31,079
a technology question however mmm
getting back to what you were saying

669
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:31,450
about

670
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,540
never give up users you unless you
legally require any

671
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,140
less than a review mentioned
specifically

672
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:43,750
don't do it someone you credit for

673
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:47,790
what are the one what are the chances

674
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:51,640
someone giving using a credit card him
social security number

675
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,540
and just lead try and somehow are you
not legally

676
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,410
for try and find a I if so I'm never
problem

677
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,930
with my last record is are you know I
just put

678
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:06,879
I just put in walls zeros basin

679
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,480
like no no I put in all zeros

680
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,000
but I wrote next in parentheses will not
give out social security number

681
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,569

682
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:23,650
also record your kill weeds grow poor
are that's a patriot law

683
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:27,140
I'm yes the legally required to do it I
mean giver

684
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,480
I skated by you my post office box

685

ridiculous Commons that anybody who does
not have the Facebook

697

and you do not believe that there is not

698
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,570
zillion pots loading reopened around for
a small

699
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,730
all something the information to someone
who's

700
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:30,350
were not only a few not so the Privacy
Policy don't know they exist

701
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:35,799
solely all those a the exact on

702
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,370
sleep or inside people's

703
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:43,790
okay importance is number one any

704
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,080
online site where there's hundreds of
thousands or millions that use use

705
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,770
who promise you privacy are big flood
waters

706
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,830
because any one of those people that has
access your profile can

707
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,029
assist in the violence your privacy I
could tell you

708

I have mobile profiles and multiple

709
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:09,660
passwords every single one of the sites
I'm never called what's

710
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,100
I mean I once saw all these identities
because I figured

711
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:16,750
argues what what's the catch is the
cutoff for me to use the next one

712
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,600
then everyone found them so

713
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:27,350
yes in my you the Privacy Policy on the
Site is meaningless

714
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,470
it may be you to buy them

715
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,590

723
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,650

black ones got nothing no

761
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:42,098

director

762
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,230
saying Steve you're always you time

763

they don't give you anything they can
cut out i mean they're so

764
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,270
by the way this is not a bad thing its
its abuse

765
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,740
but they have the right to say we want
to protect confidential sources

766
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,570
we want to protect believe the phrases
methods and means basically

767
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,339
how they feel about your criminal in the
first place and so on and so on

over these things and zip you know it's
it's a really it's really phenomenal

890
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,920
questions cause she knows

891
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,630
I was on those with those pretty much
nobody else does

892
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,780
if I want to use I was on one way or
another I was all like service

893
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,240
what do you know that's a huge problem
and the answer is

894
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,520
if you're really determined to protect
your privacy

895
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:16,940
server online identity that fits all the
requirements your mailing address

896
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,819
incredible

897
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:21,850
your post office box the bureaucratic or

898
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:25,600
lead to hook up if the crime called
clears

899
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,750
they don't really care limit

900
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:31,760
was for jobs so no

901
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,150
usually just see when I missed it

902
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:38,609
something everybody's from those places
services they've all

903
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:45,160
it stately privacy since his

904
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,259
you know thats that's the point it has
to start sort their business

905
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:54,619
and the reason it does a this because
you people are clueless

906
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:58,140
I mean I think it's fair to say
fifty-something focus on other

907
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:01,259
up the stuff we discussed today most
people you didn't know about

908
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,330
you are terrifically educated people
another inquisitive

909
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,799
I do you know about imagine

910
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:14,290
I mean a matching the theology Norman
don't purse

911
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,850
so for some was making the public aware
that something will change in the public

912
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:18,810
eye on to the

913
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:21,830
what's out there can't do anything about

914
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,799
I mean you has to be penalty few
gathering information on me that I don't

915
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:30,460
