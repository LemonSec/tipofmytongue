1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,290
the evening everyone it is a Saturday
1900 area be

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,290
we're about to hear from G subsys

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,150
to number 55

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:21,150
the German number 55 thank you

5
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,929
my name's J Cell to hurt us the I am a
member of hacktivism

6
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:32,449
which is a human rights and Technology
Group some you wanna see me before today

7
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:36,570
when can we released a big major piece a
software called scattershot

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,190
I see some familiar faces scatter chat
is a

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,289
major project I've been working on for a
few years and

10
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:51,489
this presentation is a direct result a
bit constructing cryptographic protocols

11
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:55,519
in this

12
00:00:55,519 --> 00:01:00,070
I miss talking to show a very basic
cryptographic protocol

13
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:05,610
and I'm going to interactively build
upon it through several rounds

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,090
an initial at which round

15
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,670
what's wrong and how to fix it and so
you build up

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:18,040
to a final protocol which fulfills all
these requirements for john Lynch

17
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,530
for this presentation on

18
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:26,940
you're going to need knowledge on basics
of cryptography

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,899
like what asymmetric and symmetric
photography is

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,160
the general idea behind each max

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,770
digital signatures that senator you
don't need a math background

22
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,240
but be good if you know if you're
familiar with mathematical notation

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,240
alright well the protocol that I
designed a miscarriage a program

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,870
is want one communications protocol

25
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,070
that means one person talking to exactly
one other person

26
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,560
I mean daughter up from the

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,020
one too many your many like for example

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:10,590
chair finance that instant messages
would be one thing

29
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,790
so this protocol was signed

30
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,870
as several advanced cryptographic
features between

31
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,630
talk about a show and explain and like I
said

32
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:27,049
start with a basic protocol builder

33
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,850
the first before we go to that the
requirements before you start designing

34
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,480
anything you have to understand

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,500
we're trying to go what goals are trying
to me

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,930
so these are the requirements for the
protocol but I was designing

37
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,870
for one has to be secure against
well-funded totalitarian governments

38
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,240
those are the people that are looking to
bust

39
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,860
political dissidents human rights
activists operating in

40
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,920
oppressive situations so that's to be

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,450
fairly strong too is that the passive

42
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,830
here cannot be pro passive here i'm
talking about.

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,450
the one peer that does not initiate the
conversation

44
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,650
the ones passes reason for that is a in
some countries

45
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,580
cryptography is a legal just plain
illegal use it you go to jail

46
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,390
immediately soon the you're doing
something that so

47
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,060
it would not be good if the protocol you
design

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,180
you be able to send some kind of pain
packet amid

49
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,740
your protocol automatically responds to
it that would give away the fact that

50
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,110
you

51
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,380
are capable encryption and then you get
thrown in jail

52
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:47,349
so that has to be avoid on next one is
resistance to traffic analysis

53
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:52,640
I'm gonna detail with traffic analysis
is later on

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,700
also has to be resilient against partial
compromise

55
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,920
so for example if one appears was
arrested

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,310
and had his place rated by save the
Chinese government near the Saudi Arabia

57
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,739
Arabian government

58
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,910
and once I dove the

59
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,000
the protocol was freeze

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,689
that person's key was compromised and

61
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:23,259
past conversations and also compromised
so as

62
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,259
has to be partially reviewing

63
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,419
all so as to allow file transfers

64
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:34,240
so some notation first

65
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,370
like I said when I'm gonna talk about
asymmetric encryption and decryption

66
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,090
at the top I'm going to to know them

67
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,370
like so he

68
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,719
subscript a underscore pod

69
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:54,409
um people see says public key encryption

70
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:58,409
using eighties key A's public key

71
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:03,669
above message and yield cipher text see

72
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,779
next to that D Christian using eighties
private key

73
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,990
love this sorry for text equals

74
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,430
the original message and then symmetric
encryption and decryption operations you

75
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,680
need to know

76
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,389
like that lower case the with two
arguments came in and K is gonna be

77
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:25,539
your shared the his message people
cipher text

78
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:31,318
likewise for D

79
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,370
case around wanna protocol

80
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,559
I'm going to stick with the traditional
using Allison bob is the to peers

81
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:47,039
as is the tradition cryptic
cryptographic protocols

82
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,068
the first to Alice needs to get the
bob's public key

83
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:54,939
referring to start this off using public
key crypto

84
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:59,650
so else gets bob key somehow either from
Bob directly

85
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:05,509
or from a server from there Ellis
calculate C-one

86
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,900
by encrypting to bob's public key which
you just downloaded

87
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,860
some I'm one I met you transmit and one
across the wire

88
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,710
over the right to Bob but 2d crib is
crazy as private key

89
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,359
d krissi001 which is what you just read
to recover and one which was the

90
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,409
original message

91
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:32,409
so you can read what else just Sun

92
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:38,529
K there's the one main problem with us

93
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:42,039
does work for small messages

94
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,438
for larger message is it does not reason
is because

95
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,499
public key encryption is very very slow

96
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:54,240
its several orders of magnitude slower
than so much for decryption

97
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,879
you cannot use that in real time to make
writ large

98
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,460
amounts of debt file transfers large
files cannot be

99
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:07,119
encrypt it with public key encryption

100
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,979
you can encrypt it with symmetric key so
we're going to need

101
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:17,979
eventually is I a hybrid system both

102
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:25,649
Sears round two will build upon

103
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:31,259
we have Alice first calculating c0

104
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,270
she generates a random PK no

105
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,580
actuation I should mention there's not
enough remind all my slides to be

106
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,289
very for me and all my definitions here
so I have to dictate

107
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:45,539
you know what somebody's these figures
means

108
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,289
so she's first generates a random PK
which we're going to use as a symmetric

109
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,289
key

110
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:56,419
like I said you can use metrics unit to
encrypt files

111
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,179
so we're gonna have to use their

112
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:05,659
so we encrypt this random TK call it c0

113
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:09,229
Alice also than take sexy

114
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,639
and applies a symmetric cipher

115
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,949
to compute C-one and that you transmits

116
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,349
c0 and c1 over about barber covers the
key K

117
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:25,199
using public key the crips and

118
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,939
on c0 so he recovers K and then to use a
symmetric decryption

119
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,479
with that PK on c1 to obtain

120
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,880
someone the original message

121
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,719
and then if you want send a message back
to Dallas just computes

122
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,240
you know encryption of that same key
holes on 2k for this session

123
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,519
the problem with this protocol there is
no integrity checking done

124
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,380
on c1 which is the key

125
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,480
ciphers kenna ensure integrity

126
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,870
they don't by design

127
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,259
excuse me they were not designed for
that purpose

128
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,480
so the integrity of K is not sure

129
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,350
file transfers are possible now because
we are using symmetric key cryptography

130
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,639
and also notice though the Bob campy pro

131
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:24,380
doesn't necessarily have to respond in
any way

132
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,430
so the passive the passive Pierre

133
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:35,430
can stay anonymous if each if
researchers

134
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,160
so around three I'm gonna keep building
this up so I'm gonna

135
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:45,560
second right yeah you can see the green

136
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,910
is what I'm gonna be adding I did it
this way because

137
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,010
the slides are going to be a pretty
messy Frank previous

138
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,620
notes so the green stuff is what I'm
gonna be adding red stuff is what I'm

139
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,510
gonna be taken away

140
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,860
so there's no integrity on K

141
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,790
so we need to add some I was first
calculates

142
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,660
s 0 by computing and digital signature
with her private key

143
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,089
on K course also ship generate K

144
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,460
she then encrypts K

145
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,350
to bob's public you to create c0 and
then again

146
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,520
just as before chink rip someone to
create see

147
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,040
she transmits all these three

148
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,130
over c0 us 0 which is a signature on
Cesar

149
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,640
and then see what Bob to recover the key
K

150
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,500
he verifies with his public key

151
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,270
with A's public key alice is public key
you verify the signature on K

152
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,439
and and is guaranteed now that the
integrity is valid

153
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,690
and then we can recover M-one

154
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,510
than later if you want to transmit his
own message you can compute the same

155
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,170
thing did

156
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:06,630
Ellis did before and also center Assane
long

157
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:13,630
his own signature on that

158
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,360
signature own on sorry I'm sorry

159
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,730
yeah that's that's a mistake there's no
small strike just want a

160
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,690
I would prefer to take questions at the
for

161
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:42,690
unless there's another mister occurs

162
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,170
3 okay

163
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:52,189
the problem with this this protocol
around three stone round three

164
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,760
the problem with this is that we're
exposing a signature on

165
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,730
K which may leak some information that's
not

166
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,070
the tonight solid vulnerability

167
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,270
it's just kinda love not considered good
practice

168
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,410
in my opinion to expose a signature
especially if it's possible to hide

169
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,240
their signature

170
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,220
you can you can have the same guarantee
integrity without exposing

171
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,580
the signature that is what I call

172
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,260
a proactive design I'm a big proponent
protracted designs

173
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,090
and so I would maintain the as 0 should
be

174
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:36,090
k so to hide

175
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,770
us 0 we appended to

176
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:48,630
the key K and we hide it we had a
bankrupt in

177
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,090
encrypt it that that double pipe symbol

178
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,060
to know it's concatenation what you do
is just

179
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,790
take a whole buncha bites slaps another
bite at the end that's okay

180
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,400
so in this model

181
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,410
we're hiding the signature by
concatenating

182
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,630
toukie K encrypting all that and now we
don't need to send us the road

183
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,380
as you can see and

184
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,860
also noticed by can still usually
recover this

185
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,760
he just the crib c0 splits apart K

186
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,319
and s0 runs a verification signature

187
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,710
from there he can get the message and
then he can centered

188
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,710
you can send his own messages so for tax

189
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,330
X aka

190
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,510
so the the signatures now protected

191
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,520
the problem with this though is the

192
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:54,520
the messages are not signed we just the
shirt I integrity on the keys

193
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,520
the non messages we do this also

194
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,520
similarly by signing M-one

195
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,199
and well we were

196
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,320
I just made a point about hiding the
signatures want to do it again

197
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,000
we can hide it there in c1 the signature
on

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,800
and we can encrypt all

199
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,980
so the the signature on the messages
also

200
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,350
do not pass over the wire notice bob

201
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,650
and d crypto this and verified us

202
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,880
but the problem with this

203
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,880
this protocol is that we broke

204
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,390
files file transfers why did we put
break

205
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,949
transfers speaking like to use

206
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,890
this is one

207
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,199
with asymmetric well there is no

208
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:06,200
asymmetric encryption going on

209
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,210
it might be hard distinguish the
signature from the file

210
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:22,210
no because you can't begin D crippling
the message until you get to the end of

211
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,500
the entire file and recover the
signature

212
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:33,360
no up okay

213
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,300
the reason is weaving last absent the
reason is because

214
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,410
digital signatures are also slow reason
digital signatures their

215
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,790
signatures on K and

216
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,870
someone you sir crips

217
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,960
he was close

218
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,960
the setting for a few minutes signature
concern yes

219
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:07,610
so used signing will depends it depends
on the

220
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:14,050
the question was assigning the signing
take as long as a cryptic it depends on

221
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:14,690
the

222
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:18,060
actual protocol in use if you're using
arce it's the same

223
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,350
mathematically speaking algorithm

224
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,090
is the same thing urged for predicting

225
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:33,330
okay

226
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:38,600
alright

227
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,080
so the problem was the digital
signatures so we just heard

228
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,100
replace them with H max age Mac function

229
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,940
is the symmetric equivalent digital
signatures it's the same thing

230
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,750
if you're interested in knowing how it's
implemented is

231
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,170
a hash function the mixes and the

232
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,870
input with a key through

233
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,420
is its secure hash algorithm upcoming
samples

234
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,220
you can you show one show 256 or 512

235
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,280
there's a specific way to do it out

236
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:20,680
actually mixing your key you can look
this up but actually before the

237
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,260
notice the Allison as 0 she generates

238
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,260
two keys k1 and k2 the reason is that
you want to use one key for encryption

239
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,410
and 14

240
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,760
integrity you don't want to use the same
key for that

241
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,900
actually

242
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,180
I'll I've never actually read any
attacks their

243
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,570
exist if you use the same fever

244
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,620
I believe it's just bad practice to do
so

245
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:54,160
and I can imagine I mean I I kinda get
that feeling

246
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,160
if you use the same fee for both that's
a bad idea okay so I also notice on the

247
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,790
right bob

248
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,930
just runs in each Mac Shack in this case

249
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,590
like I said it's all revolves around a
hash function so he just

250
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,659
re computes the

251
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,110
half and check to see that it's what was
sent

252
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,870
and that then it guarantees that the

253
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,450
he message Herbals are both fell

254
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:33,450
that their integrity is assured the
problem with this round is that there is

255
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,690
no perfect perfect forward secrecy

256
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:43,690
tried K if an adversary logs all the
conversations

257
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,800
then obtains one peers privately say the
Chinese government takes down somebody's

258
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,280
door

259
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,629
those conversations cannot be decrypted

260
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,860
if perfect forward secrecy was in play
and I'll describe what

261
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,190
and all rolls around that equation right
there

262
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,620
a people's k1 x32 if

263
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,780
each side so if you want your to
generate a key

264
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,120
safety k1 in k2

265
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,890
then they exchange mickey's

266
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,600
the trader so the both sides

267
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:27,260
q1 q2 then they can compute K with this
equation and notice that both

268
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,930
come up with the same then the Federal
Way k1 k2

269
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,680
they wait for members it's not needed we
just arrived K

270
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,790
we throw that away use K as an ephemeral
sessions

271
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,639
so we're going to use this key for one
conversation

272
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,640
so if

273
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:55,159
k if the first here the

274
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,720
the private key words: compromise the

275
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,080
K one can be recovered

276
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:09,080
but k2 can and if k2 campy recovered

277
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,350
just after one you can't

278
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,550
computer K camp computer K

279
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,860
you can recover though and you

280
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:25,860
the saved messages

281
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,090
this is just the

282
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,520
so this is just the beginning part

283
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,960
love last protocol

284
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,560
we sign

285
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,810
K the one which is the first half of the
encryption key

286
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,810
we sign kph one which is the first half

287
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,770
each mackey encrypt all their

288
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,850
encrypt the two halves and the signature

289
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:06,050
transmit that cipher text bob than does
the same thing that whole blog network

290
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:11,440
right is just the same thing that ousted
matter

291
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,020
and so he shoots over C-one

292
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,540
than the the crypt before

293
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:24,590
and they both computer that same
equation 24 for both keys

294
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,750
so they both then have key K E

295
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,730
key each

296
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:41,730
was gonna pause for a second pleasured

297
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:52,840
K-seven just like before else that wants
to transmit a message

298
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,899
she computer stage-managed then encrypts

299
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:03,340
the message appended today & Sons
likewise

300
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,230
case a replay attacks

301
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,340
me for Intex involved introducing in
crib two blocks from previous

302
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,350
conversations

303
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,870
you blog stream from before

304
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,530
pick out some blocks and try to
reintroduce them into a new street

305
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,899
attacker would want to do that

306
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,650
for several reasons to introduce errors
into the street or to spoof messages

307
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:32,790
that can be pretty pretty serious

308
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,690
sometimes blocks are known by the
attacker

309
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:41,220
you can sometimes discern what they are

310
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,070
for such an analysis which get into or
it could just be around mister

311
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,059
like blisters try to get lucky and try
to insert messages

312
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,940
they can be

313
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,240
replay attacks Louisville against
automated communications training so

314
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,650
some kind you know server client program
that issues

315
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,160
data to each other they can be pretty we
feel

316
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,150
less urgent in real time chat settings I
mean

317
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:12,179
imagine if you have a long just the
messenger conversation

318
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,440
and also in like a previous sections of
sentences start appearing

319
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,800
like you know something's up just not
heard

320
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,500
it's less urgent but it's still pro

321
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,580
so how to

322
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,090
immunize yourself against this attack
one way is to do

323
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:37,540
introduce a message counter to encrypt a
message

324
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,290
you know and the signature and append
some kinda imager

325
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:47,720
a counter which you keep on incriminate
the receiver

326
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,530
also know CTR and and

327
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,670
check well after a crypt is does this
message match

328
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:02,520
the counter that I'm expecting you have
to be careful with this

329
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,560
this method cuz if below

330
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,030
blocks coming in a synchronicity

331
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:13,620
a synchronously you handle it allies

332
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:20,620
your screen is cracked traffic analysis
is studying the patterns of

333
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,190
communications to drive

334
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,850
extra information here's an example
let's say in the 2004 election in texas

335
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,330
you capture traffic from voting machines

336
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,350
the messages you notice contain
repetitious

337
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,440
see tabulate these frequencies and this
is what you come up with

338
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,560
yes eighty percent evolve messages

339
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,110
are created encrypt messages come out to
the following

340
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,020
thats overtaxed nineteen percent and
then you have one percent

341
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,080
that strain right there no knowing the
context

342
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,159
here 2004 Texas

343
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,820
what do you think that eighty percent

344
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,460
is you can look at the you can analyze
this in a couple ways

345
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,929
the first thing is a eighty percent of
something

346
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:17,140
tells will information to the wife

347
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,690
that Sypher tax four letters long some
information

348
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:27,770
next the middle sorry for taxes five
letters long

349
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,340
and the last minute filers so you assume
okay the top one is bush

350
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,320
the second one is scared and want to
guess what that one percent might be

351
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,620
alright nader

352
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:46,890
yes he's my hero yes

353
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,440
so they're yours and example traffic
analysis

354
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,830
appointed I want to mention is that

355
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,129
its it's very dependent upon the context
within

356
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,950
if I just give you that that tabulation
those frequencies

357
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,419
about tell tell you where it's from what
time it is

358
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:13,419
et cetera that doesn't mean anything so
to resist against this

359
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,380
traffic analysis can't be forward very
very difficult

360
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,970
word against traffic analysis but you
can you can introduce some resistance to

361
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,590
it and also you know

362
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,900
first is

363
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,440
to a few ski message life like I said
before like yourself or you can count

364
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,070
the

365
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,070
Seifert ex-wife they can give you some
information so you can do some

366
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,220
and you can align

367
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,400
the cipher text up to sun block

368
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,590
what is good alignment thats undefined

369
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,900
if you make it to large like let's say
align everything to something ridiculous

370
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,190
like

371
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,370
one megabyte so that means every single
message you send

372
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,520
and doing headed up to one megabyte
you're wasting water space

373
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,730
you might be hiding the true-life

374
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,159
like you to highlight likes with them
your message could be

375
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,070
three bites it could be killed 10k

376
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:19,950
but the downside is that your you're
wasting space on average a race day

377
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:24,060
half

378
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,450
on the other side if you make a
too-small line to see for Boyd's

379
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:33,720
you can't really hide too many messages
within

380
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,300
I don't have a good we need to use
suggests how to calculate

381
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,370
alignments it's just kinda something
that you

382
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:47,770
guess

383
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,129
a also to protect against message
repetition analysis which was a problem

384
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,010
previous example you can make nixon
random data

385
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:59,240
the safer input as you see there

386
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,980
take your message and you slam on some
random bikes

387
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,890
your resulting see is going to be
different every time a few Creek

388
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,730
and the same three times

389
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,890
the Seas gonna be different every single
time because you just encrypt a grand

390
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:19,990
you next summer

391
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,230
and don't 10 the one injures up

392
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,300
and rend towards the end problem

393
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:33,300
wanna sprinkle just saying

394
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:39,720
yes so that was the that was the design
methodology that went behind my program

395
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,390
my project call scatter chat implements
all these features

396
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,620
just a little a quick announcement about
it if they had to this application

397
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,650
enables encryption and freezers
anonymity over

398
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:55,530
instant messaging networks scatter chat

399
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,690
I just did a really big presentation on
it before one yet

400
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:03,560
CDs

401
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,330
any questions

402
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:12,810
just about to play

403
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,770
the X or to do the two keys together and
produce 30

404
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,150
is that was on the same problems like
diffie-hellman key exchange is that is

405
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,090
now that's used for

406
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,460
yes yeah have used that cuz to
standardize their

407
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,560
I mean its prime complicated sometimes X
or

408
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,290
um it I mean it depends on what what
situation one

409
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,580
use it in yet the diffie-hellman
algorithm those

410
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:41,290
does provide the same it is I mean and I
know thats much more complicated so is

411
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,629
it is there a reason you would do that
instead of just x or two things together

412
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:50,460
towers simpler a

413
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,270
so good that's a good question I am
having trouble coming up

414
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:59,720
with an example I do know that I am
switching to

415
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,130
did myself so I know that you know it's
not that

416
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,280
know if you can if you can replace the
back in the the second version the

417
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,500
protocol

418
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,870
I'm actually searching to elliptic curve
cryptography

419
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:17,970
very sexy

420
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:22,800
and two no it's not bad

421
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,520
it's not planted there's a lot of hands
and lips occur tiger fever

422
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,050
that other than itself is not that what
do you plan on doing about

423
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:36,990
the keys swaps this before interest

424
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:40,149
if the keys that swap to monitor the
activity to

425
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:44,120
21 this post their way every court have
swap

426
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,020
to the swept to the disc if it gets

427
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,590
I mean that's an operating system issue
at Sears have to say

428
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,740
if you really care saw

429
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,740
that's an option or use some kinda
secure memory livor

430
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:09,950
if you want to use a premium over them
or Fri meet currents

431
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:13,290
for a cost SSL what would your current
favorite be

432
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,200
feeding Monica trouble creating surgery
for

433
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,280
if you want to review if you want to use
a preemie cryptographic

434
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,280
system for key negotiations such what
with your current favorite be

435
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,840
doing besides my own your life

436
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:41,840
one is the

437
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,990
do some options of SSL

438
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,260
one or NTL

439
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,720
which isn't much every Windows computer
yeah I'm

440
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,909
I'm don't really know the the details
I'm sorry like a

441
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:05,909
in your

442
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,990
out for them to send you introduced a
Exchange under them

443
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,269
and that happens before the message is
sent

444
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,370
answer compulsory response does that

445
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:22,950
break one of your your own

446
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,309
China thing my China up

447
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,529
yeah I didn't go into to a wasn't as
verbose

448
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:35,870
on the as I should have like through the
the protocols on it so much

449
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:39,700
space on my slides but the

450
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,149
receiving Pierre does not necessarily
need to respond

451
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:48,880
when the initial they know who the
sender as before they negotiate the

452
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,960
sender

453
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,330
asunder sons initial message the
receiver

454
00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:00,210
can check the signature and then decide

455
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,010
of its broken not gonna respond news or
if it's not broken

456
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:10,039
let's leave it up to the user like
display key hash: save this person

457
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,419
was tryna initiate a conversation with
you anyone except

458
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:17,529
you can also then roll in 20 role in PK
I

459
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:20,620
into this so that can come to kill

460
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,320
things for them or so you can have you
know if it automatically

461
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,939
authenticates through PTI structure

462
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,980
then you can responded sitters you can
have a user settings

463
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,909
for all this depending on how paranoid
you are but the bottom line is

464
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:40,130
that the protocol can support this

465
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,570
and also does it support deniability and
houses

466
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,250
related to off-the-record which is
obviously on everyone's mind right now

467
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:51,590
yes said whittier

468
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:56,139
a all to your question I was hoping

469
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:00,360
nobody's gonna because that was like the
one thing the

470
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,270
I had on my big to do list that I never
got to and I have the

471
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,280
the documentation here that said look at
this stuff because somebody's gonna ask

472
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,109
you about this

473
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:15,810
and I didn't have time do you like five
minutes after this presentation

474
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,540
I'm gonna look at my notes like I should
have beforehand and I'll answer this

475
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,239
question ir

476
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,500
RM on poems somewhat involved apart our

477
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,679
great I am did the difference between
what you're doing of course is that

478
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,220
I'm you're sending signatures with every
message

479
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,450
so it's hard to refute the fact that
you've talked to each other

480
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,469
so with the two first-half talk to each
other and I for Chinese government in my

481
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:41,909
neck

482
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:45,480
and you still keep talking to me and the
Chinese government has proved it you've

483
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,349
actually talk to me

484
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:51,510
you've signed messages otra uses a
diffie-hellman key exchange

485
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:56,389
and then leaks out part of the Mac later
on which means that people can force

486
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,380
messages for only in the past

487
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,589
which means that even if I'm compromised

488
00:35:02,589 --> 00:35:07,920
you are not and the did of course the
problem with a tear for you

489
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,619
is that you doing a diffie-hellman key
sent all the time

490
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:15,130
which is expensive which works for I am
but not for from transfers

491
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,470
but that wouldn't be too hard to to
change the follicle to add a

492
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,430
session key generation to it forward to
a landing craft

493
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:27,279
symmetric encryption for from yes I will
definitely look into OT are

494
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,230
yeah it's been it's been done by people
who studied at Berkeley 10

495
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,190
professors universities I'm I know AT&T
has that some people look at it

496
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:40,440
I'm and not really find any problems
with it for porfis hard to do all by

497
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,170
yourself

498
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,390
yeah don't recommend trusting no

499
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,270
the one person cryptosystem and it's not
because it's you

500
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:54,330
anybody who missed and there I would say
the same thing understand the

501
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:58,190
or tears message tonight bility
functionality can be rolled into this

502
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:00,670
quake easily because I'm using its max

503
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:06,450
it's pretty easy to roll into so that's
actually this

504
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,169
that's partially correct there are there
was a big problem is covered with otro

505
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:17,170
yeah it's Alex right reckon it's been
since fixed but the original version

506
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:24,259
you're happy I'm so I'm sorry actually
so did you do your sign for the service

507
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,740
with

508
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,839
with session Keesler with was for

509
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:32,119
you when you're signing messages I and
after forgetting

510
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,230
when you when you do the signing of the
messages you did with it session key

511
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,740
or is it the more a longer-lasting key
sign the

512
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,810
session key with the long term side ok
so yes it does

513
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,599
the the question actually had his if
you're worried about I'm

514
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,770
traffic analysis why not use approach
like I love going chasing

515
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,880
to do visits and just things that turn
you stop it will look like actual

516
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,690
messages but the

517
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:58,800
will get dropped on your hands because
you know that they're not actually

518
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,520
coming from the person you're talking to

519
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,830
her right now I mean I'm it sounded like
you mean it that you made it sound like

520
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:09,890
more difficult problem I think it's

521
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:16,890
sorry of

522
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,470
US questions his

523
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,900
this she things in place but

524
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,880
would the polling public key indicate

525
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,950
and I'm workers just me

526
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,580
yeah the

527
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,000
which my friends here this answer I
don't know the laws

528
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,010
there but the technical question is

529
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,530
the scene the key is a all how do you
hide the key

530
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,839
steganography

531
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,240
wean where I mean it may not be
understanding something

532
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:06,150
pretty sensual when you said the prefer
to send to fix

533
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,490
word links with d

534
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:14,260
scattered to it hit the fact that you
have separate ones that these

535
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,430
up exactly the same length is not a kind

536
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,629
something to bring these messages
together

537
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:24,530
unless I'm misunderstanding movie
usurper be able to see

538
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:29,190
yes that although messages are the same
so they know that some paintings being

539
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:36,190
I mean that's that's assuming that that
public the design of the system

540
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,900
alright thank you
