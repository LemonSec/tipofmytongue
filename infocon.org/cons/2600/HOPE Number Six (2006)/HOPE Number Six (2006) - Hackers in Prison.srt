1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,540
to Asian legally for us because I

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,910
I was on federal supervised release

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,219
on people are familiar with the Federal
prison system is a

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,660
back in 87 I think the federal
government get away with it

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,410
has a congress get away completely with
parole there is no parole in the federal

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,310
system you serve your entire time or

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,340
or all but a little it less

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,330
I for good time havier whatever what is
it like 10 percent something like that

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,920
is they have some formula and

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,190
records and whatever but it's basically
serve your whole sense and that's how

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,400
that you get a whole second

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,629
hair loss ends or serial sense on top of
that

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:42,030
have several years under soup federal
supervised release

14
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,900
which is exactly the same as parole so

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,570
but it's not perot so it's basically
going to census like

16
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,860
yes it's a weird thing that's they'd
like to throw this exercise in there so

17
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,269
I had

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,370
I have three years a federal supervised
release after my release in

19
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,680
I I did as well and the thing that was
funny

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,329
be on hold is that while we were
scheduled to be on the same panel

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,330
technically and legally we're not
allowed to associate with each other

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,170
this one other

23
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,710
wanna the conditions of being on
supervised release is that you're not

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,670
supposed to associate with a known felon

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,830
and since we both were we are actually
on stage with

26
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,420
divider partition between us we

27
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,140
literally had a big piece a poster board
between us we couldn't see each other

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,270
and the we gave me the idea of doing
that I was talking with manual

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,880
that I remember the on forget to the
head of sinn thing was in there

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,699
in Britain UK he greatest crazy la UK

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,979
broadcasting law that the you can't air
the words

32
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,170
love anyone who is in a the British
terrorist organization nom

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,210
same thing so so they said so on

34
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,760
they would have these lips anchors I my
read the words

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,970
that they with you would have their this
head is in vain on

36
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,509
on TV in a news interview or something
without his voice and have somebody

37
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,740
this lip sync the words I just thought I
was a ludicrous we did we have to do

38
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,590
something similar this week with this
border between us we couldn't see each

39
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,100
other

40
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,129
and we couldn't talk to each other on
the panel but if I want to ask a

41
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:10,529
question

42
00:02:10,529 --> 00:02:14,180
mark on like a what about that happening
mark I would ask

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,099
a manual like a well I wonder if this
ever happened to mark a man who has he

44
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:19,619
told you

45
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,189
and then hearings got moderate it was it
was like this ludicrous

46
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:26,950
jumping through hoops kinda thing we had
to go through just

47
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,469
for rules that we couldn't talk to each
other Salaam

48
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,559
good thing we can talk to each other
that'd by Tom

49
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:39,079
this this panel today is basically
coming full circle

50
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:42,299
nearly nearly ten years later now

51
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,629
and I mean that's that's ancient history
and we thought it would be really cool

52
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,179
to revisit the original

53
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,230
now that we are allowed to associate
with each other while

54
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,209
little summary about how we got into the
predicament the first place

55
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,949
well your case was first no case I guess
I guess I'll begin at the beginning

56
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:05,760
and and I should say ironically a idea

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,929
basically I help take mark to priests

58
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:13,319
yeah in a in a bizarre way we'll get
into that part of it but

59
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,469
yes how did you get your jam mom

60
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:19,540
well I was involved with Joe

61
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,730
couple of hacker group back in the
eighties

62
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,079
Legion of Doom and masters of deception

63
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,180
make a long story short

64
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,639
we were extremely proficient getting
access to

65
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,439
just about anything we got into a lot of
lot

66
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,279
lot of phone companies throughout the
country telephone switches and so on

67
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:47,198
where a lot of packet data network
selects 25 stuff this is before

68
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,029
really before anyone was even bothering
with internet there was no World Wide

69
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:51,430
Web

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,689
there was none other on it was a much
more simpler time everything was pretty

71
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,108
much on

72
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,729
on and

73
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:06,729
make a long story short again we
ultimately got into

74
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:10,540
enough trouble with the government we

75
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,629
become very high profile up until the

76
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:20,590
late 80's early 90's number of us myself
included were doing a lot of interviews

77
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,720
are our personal identity was pretty
much known

78
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,310
so I mean really if the government
wanted to

79
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,160
catches in the act doing something
certainly possible do so

80
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,180
and yes they really seized upon the
opportunity

81
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,380
in nineteen ninety and ninety-one
several of us

82
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,730
had been rated by both the secret
service and the FBI

83
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,750
for charges including conspiracy

84
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,050
to commit wire fraud computer trespass
and

85
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,730
things of that nature well by myself
personally was not implicated

86
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,550
in any major in the indictment itself

87
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,260
I only had maybe two or three counts
against me well there were others in

88
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,390
me 20 or more counts

89
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,020
I was really one of the more your
profile people

90
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,340
that was indicted by the government and
so the government seized upon the

91
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,230
opportunity

92
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,610
to use that to their own advantage to
get a lot of publicity

93
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,820
as far as what they consider to be
proficiency

94
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,020
tracked down and prosecuted hackers
unfortunately for them I think

95
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,060
really backfired because the media
really didn't identify

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,740
with with their point of view

97
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,800
in fact I had found out from a number of
media people that I was very friendly

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,400
with

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,160
at the time because I done so many
interviews on a regular basis

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,320
and in fact media people call me

101
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,830
from my own and I and told me it was
going on

102
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,609
federal government didn't bother telling
me that happen so I actually showed up

103
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,250
at my own indictment

104
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,630
at Center Street here in the city where
the federal buildings or

105
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,760
and that's really unusual that doesn't
happen usually doesn't happen I was

106
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,960
tipped off by my own meet your friends

107
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,260
to go to my own indictment and was not
allowed to go in

108
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,740
because I didn't have press credentials

109
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,260
that was that was the the first 20 think
that day the second funny thing is that

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,080
was I figured well hey you know what I
just got indicted

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,340
not allowed to go into my own indictment
I better get a jump start on things and

112
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,520
get an attorney so I called I call legal
aid

113
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,780
and I told them I'm being indicted

114
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,930
and I'm gonna need you know legal
representation

115
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,950
and they told me how did you know you're
being indicted sir

116
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,219
anti-civil right across the street right
now in forty Centre Street

117
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,410
there's a big show gonna and I'm being
indicted trust me

118
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,730
you can go over there and check cells
mom so that was that was a really funny

119
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,960
demonstration

120
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,639
the bureaucracy at work time foreshadows
things to come

121
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,660
definitely

122
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,530
the thing that was really scary at that
time

123
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,110
prior to the actually as far as the
search and seizures

124
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,230
which oftentimes happen

125
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,570
your more before you can actually ever
be charged

126
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,780
mean simi it's very backwards to

127
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,830
get a warrant go into someone's home
expecting to find something

128
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,840
basically confiscate all their personal
property then review it after the fact

129
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,990
and then crafted indictment and your
later

130
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,530
after you have years time to look over
all the evidence

131
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,220
I would 10 think that most people have
something

132
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,320
that the government would find
unpleasant

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,909
in their apartment right now the
government was allowed to break

134
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,160
take all their things look over it with
a fine-tooth comb for years time

135
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,910
and then come back here later and decide
what they can and I

136
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,550
I would tend to think a lot of people
would probably following the auspices

137
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:06,990
the law and its you know may seem like
what is a fishing expedition

138
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,340
they can't do that well it depends how
the

139
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,630
the the wording is crafted honest on the
search warrant

140
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:18,600
and a anything to happen to see during a
pursuant to a legitimate search

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,210
they can also use but so I the the legal

142
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,820
I think standard is

143
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,440
if you're looking first on automobile
com

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,558
and you just put that that's that yet
item this search wanna say specifically

145
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,218
what you're looking for

146
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:37,779
%ah but if they're looking for stolen
car fridges they can look in your

147
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,979
refrigerator look in your filing cabinet
is the car could be in there so they

148
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:41,629
always

149
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:45,529
try to always without exception I think
in a search warrants a

150
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,589
that there are looking for things that
are really small like it to be a

151
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:49,839
document or something

152
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,509
that way they can hear it every nook and
cranny and then they find stuff in

153
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:57,589
values that and they were they return to
use a lot of a lot of wording

154
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,490
in the in the warrants that would allow
them to be

155
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,689
rather generic like including but not
limited to

156
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:08,839
is is a terminology love to use

157
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,059
it's like were expecting to find
computer equipment

158
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:16,290
including but not limited to CDs tapes

159
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,490
and so on and so forth there is also a
general paranoia

160
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,670
amongst the Secret Service and FBI in
the late eighties and early nineties

161
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,769
humane up familiar

162
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:31,860
all and I think it really stems from the
fact that

163
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,350
a lot of the agents that were signed to
these technology cases

164
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,689
really didn't have any technology
training

165
00:09:39,689 --> 00:09:43,290
amor sorta just thrust into it because

166
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,430
people were you know calling for a
crackdown on computer crime

167
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,149
and it was really being done by agents
with the more traditional law

168
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:52,610
enforcement training

169
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,930
so they would really arrive on the scene
not really understanding

170
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,009
what computer was and you know

171
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:02,149
really paranoid asking you questions
what's this what's that what's this

172
00:10:02,149 --> 00:10:03,300
what's

173
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,589
and you know not believing the answer
that you would give

174
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,279
like what's that poets my telephone
answering machine what does it do

175
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,970
you know it they were extremely paranoid

176
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,160
and you have some some interesting

177
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,319
funny about them accusing you of things

178
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:26,170
oh yeah on while getting del butler my
case but they would not only

179
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,430
not it was not that they there is a lot
of paranoia

180
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,619
on but it's not that they would just may
be out of ignorance

181
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:36,639
describe things that were %uh

182
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,209
found in your apartment as something
that wasn't

183
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:43,470
like the answer machine could have been
some you know they could

184
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,430
you can say with some illegal thing that
hard to do but if it's something they

185
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,949
don't know what it is they're more
likely to describe it

186
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,069
if the to do their own technically
grants they may not describe it is is

187
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,819
what it is describe it as something %uh
that would be particularly damaging

188
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:56,529
France's I

189
00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,600
me prom burner on is a did electronic
experimenting

190
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,079
projects and so forth and a I

191
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,490
also get some clients way I burn company
primes in there a

192
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,079
in there bias chipset mother was biased
ships would build up with their company

193
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,089
on which could be a waste of the hard
drive and

194
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,249
they describe this is a cellular cloned
ship adapter

195
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:25,290
thingy which wasn't electrically or

196
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,910
mechanically capable of programming the
type of chips that were used in

197
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,029
cellphones to store

198
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:33,449
electronic serial numbers but this
example love you know

199
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:35,999
lot of times I think I wasn't sure
whether it was just have technically

200
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,910
grants for they just

201
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,279
intentionally describe something as
damaging when it

202
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,589
it wasn't well you could also be the
type of

203
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:47,790
rushed training a lot of these guys were
getting

204
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,929
it's like a lot of them were aware that
cell phone cloning

205
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,559
is you know really crime and cost
millions of dollars

206
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,339
here has been going on since you know
since the very early eighties

207
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,829
so in their training they're going to be
thinking okay help

208
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:06,779
clone cell phones with any prom program
where the Finance House

209
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,649
any from program he must be cloned
phones logically this is how the law

210
00:12:10,649 --> 00:12:12,490
enforcement mind works

211
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:16,259
so it doesn't matter that the particular
object in question

212
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:20,949
might have a more wider purpose and it's
not only used to call himself

213
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,689
this was a type mentality that a lot of
us counter

214
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:27,959
and not only us as you know hackers

215
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,959
professionals and so on there are a
number of people who got caught up in a

216
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,850
lot of these searches and seizures

217
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,079
people may not remember there was famous
cases Steve Jackson

218
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:42,879
in Texas who was an adventure game
writer

219
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,019
got a basic road adventure

220
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:50,139
both on the computer and board games as
well and

221
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,300
he had an employee who new someone

222
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:56,740
was involved with computer hackers

223
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,339
and Steve Jackson games rated the secret
service

224
00:13:01,339 --> 00:13:05,240
basically trampled all over his rights
seized always

225
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,290
office computers and office equipment

226
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,309
and really threaten the livelihood of
its business which last I checked was

227
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:15,699
illegal so there was actually he
actually one

228
00:13:15,699 --> 00:13:18,999
case it was one of the few cases from
that

229
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,079
from that time period that I'll was

230
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:29,079
actually one and EF Electronic Frontier
Foundation

231
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,180
and if I recall the the federal judge
that her that case

232
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,360
%uh just really ripped into the secret
service for their

233
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,970
for their their gross mishandling on

234
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,620
in ill broski legal mishandling that
case as it was a rare moment

235
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,290
will take is we'll take it as a victory
we'll take it where we can find

236
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,689
and

237
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:59,949
something was going to say about the a
defining I've

238
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:03,970
evidence that's not a necessarily

239
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,630
what it is Tom their examples in your
case maybe things are described as

240
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,389
something they really aren't but what do
you do

241
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:16,329
about that I mean the only thing you can
do is say no it's not

242
00:14:16,329 --> 00:14:19,690
that and they'll say yes it is

243
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,389
and you know you have to basically prove
all this stuff

244
00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:26,449
on them as follows: and its really hard
to do

245
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,230
because they come up with this stuff
sometimes at the last minute or whatever

246
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:36,040
and what keeps must be prepared with a a
roomful %uh expert witnesses

247
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,689
on every particular topic that you could
use to

248
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,310
combat the the credibility

249
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,670
love their witnesses who say yes it was
something that could

250
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,810
be used for this my quick it's just it's
a bizarre

251
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:54,459
world where it's kinda like Alice in
Wonderland for you have these

252
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:57,649
these false statements made the general
public in a

253
00:14:57,649 --> 00:15:00,850
in a judge in Jerry I can understand
that this is not something that

254
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:05,009
they say it is and all you can say is no
it isn't and where they gonna believe

255
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:08,449
sorta like the Queen's looking

256
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,670
the Queen basically has the final say

257
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,040
and there's no arguing with the Queen by
om

258
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,370
the problem is that they tend to

259
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,860
simply take anything and everything
looks like because they don't want to

260
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,209
risk leaving anything behind

261
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:27,389
and find out that they lost their case
because they didn't takes

262
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,480
so anything that's battery power to plug
into the wall

263
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,920
these my keys ironically the funny thing

264
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,240
was probably about

265
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,160
me year after I was release from prison

266
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,899
with years time I was contacted to come
and pick up

267
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,050
any and all property that they still had
that they had seized

268
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,829
and he said it was in the evidence
warehouse if I didn't come and pick it

269
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:54,160
up

270
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,120
they're gonna throw it away and some
thinking oh my property was so

271
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,029
threatening to national security

272
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,519
gonna throw in the garbage if I don't
come and pick it up within the next day

273
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,420
so that was kinda I was a real reality
check for me

274
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,439
as far as like you know forestall ones
it's like you know

275
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:15,769
things are relevant in the moment as
long as you know the paranoia factors

276
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:19,870
running as soon as they realize that
what they took really didn't amount to

277
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,529
anything

278
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:24,250
and it was really just you know they're
preparing source for a show trial

279
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,000
really it was just gonna be a whole big
song and dance for them to trauma a lot

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,730
of publicity

281
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,089
some people may be familiar with and
ultimately happening

282
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:38,079
is even after I prepared for trial

283
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,740
for about here one by one everyone that
I was involved with

284
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,850
decided to LIBOR the problem with that
is that the point where you're the only

285
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,740
one left

286
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,939
not too many ways to maneuver legally

287
00:16:54,939 --> 00:17:00,519
and you know despite the fact that I
three extremely competent attorneys

288
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,220
no complaints about who actually

289
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,020
yep yes provide assistance or throughout

290
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,648
my legal problems on which i'm grateful
for this day

291
00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:16,770
ultimately no idea throw in the towel

292
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,158
and and Clybourn the only detrimental
thing

293
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:26,059
in he's it's actually held against you

294
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,220
that you decided to try to go to trial
instead of

295
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,770
admitting guilt right at the onset and

296
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,090
there's like a serious problem with that
at least you know in

297
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:40,158
in my book it's like if you wanna be
given the chance to prove that

298
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:44,520
you know you didn't do what they're
saying you should have that chance

299
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,090
should be counted against your neck

300
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:51,240
but unfortunately was so mom I did
receive one the harsher sentences

301
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,630
a year and a day 600 hours community
service

302
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,320
three years supervised release and its

303
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,168
it's not a sour grapes kinda thing but
it's its ironic that a lot of people

304
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,580
he's kinda cases

305
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,590
who may have been more were there
several codefendants

306
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,918
up where some codefendants maybe more
culpable

307
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,390
and others %ah they happen to

308
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,780
snatcher call whenever you want roll
over on

309
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:23,639
their friends former friends whatever
%ah their senses

310
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,720
they end up being 26 if new less

311
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,880
then their friends even though they were
more culpable on

312
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,659
in any actions did you run into that
situation

313
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,659
yeah actually as I said before

314
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:42,059
lot the other people that were charges
against

315
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,639
really the fed's focused on me more
because I was much more

316
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,110
high-profile character

317
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:54,240
people really know me from doing
interviews 8 appeared

318
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,419
lots newspapers magazines television

319
00:18:58,419 --> 00:19:01,799
radio every single for me you can
imagine

320
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,450
and bearing in mind this is all before
the web so we're talking like very

321
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,980
traditional media

322
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,840
so mom-and-pop was was familiar with

323
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,970
seeing on TV from time to time you know
in

324
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,470
New York Times washington Post so it was
a really

325
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,630
a high-profile opportunity the federal
government

326
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,919
to pursuant fortunately for me

327
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,490
worked against them because as I was
saying

328
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:35,299
the meteor release cited me because they
didn't really see where the threat was

329
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,990
they were aware obviously is everyone
was that yes I was breaking into

330
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,070
computers which by the letter of the law

331
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,040
was in fact legal I mean anyone can
argue

332
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,480
when we were kids and we first started
doing us which might

333
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,600
before in the audience can

334
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,610
know about I was not always easily

335
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:59,000
it was not always a legal to get access
to computers and networks

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,330
back in the early to mid 80's at some
point I think it was around 1986

337
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,908
became illegal but was never really test
it was really enforced

338
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:11,559
so we would teenagers were just keep
doing what we were doing and there was

339
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,770
really no ramifications

340
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,020
home by the time scale

341
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,429
there were a lot of sleep apps there are
a lot of more malicious people doing

342
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,520
things

343
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,250
started getting notoriety I think this
is really where there was the turn

344
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,919
the government wanting on forced to take
action and that's when things really

345
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:31,790
start

346
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:35,658
ugly but fortunately

347
00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:39,389
I was able to use the publicity in my
favor

348
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:43,580
its always help me and obtaining gainful
employment

349
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,590
I been doing work in the

350
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,709
computer security sector for many years
now

351
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,299
I've been doing system administration
security consulting

352
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,700
lots of things of that nature traveling

353
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,280
earning a very decent and honest living
using ironically

354
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,809
the same skills that I used to use to
break into computers when I was a kid

355
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:11,480
the skills are in high demand you

356
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,919
do possess the skills you do have

357
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,210
business mentality and you know how to
approach like-minded people

358
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,139
you can turn it into a non-slip so

359
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:26,240
you know if your if you did if you're

360
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,610
haggards the audience and you thinking

361
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,149
you know one day you are gonna do
something professional

362
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:36,919
might be considering it now Tom there's
no better thing to do

363
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:40,169
enter earn money for the things that
good

364
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:44,070
and so I mean I would personally
recommend

365
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,918
really are good getting access to
systems

366
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,000
don't be stupid you know don't don't do
things

367
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,780
don't don't do things like service
attacks and things like

368
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,710
just because you can just because 12 or
just because you want

369
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,530
bench because ultimately it doesn't
really amount to any

370
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,550
if you wanna prove something to somebody
don't prove that you can take down their

371
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,879
network

372
00:22:07,879 --> 00:22:11,300
rather prove that you can do something
constructive with

373
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,100
if you're concerned with breaking into
someone's network fine

374
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,470
almost did that when we were kids but we
always did something constructive with

375
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,520
it wasn't just necessarily that we could
break

376
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:29,520
the thing that was most important is
what we did once we were inside

377
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:35,370
which in many cases wasn't even
malicious it was

378
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,480
it doesn't matter it doesn't really
matter whether intent

379
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,809
to there's a tented damaged a day or
whatever and

380
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:45,820
in fact it was it was alleged in your
and I believe that you

381
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,860
destroyed a computer destroyed the

382
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,360
file yes actually one of the one of the
things was Southwestern Bell

383
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,010
alleged call forty thousand dollars
worth of damage

384
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,220
and it was really the amount of money
that they paid security consultants to

385
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,269
come and look over

386
00:23:01,269 --> 00:23:04,899
which is often times what they do when
the tally

387
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:08,519
dollar figure for what they consider to
be damage it's not really

388
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:11,820
damaged anything its what it cost them

389
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,370
to try to get you out of their system so
I mean that's the most

390
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:21,399
arguable thing that your attorney can do
or some sorry it's the biggest argument

391
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,630
that you're turning make

392
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,370
should you get into legal trouble there
is actually

393
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,970
very famous case happened back in the
early 90's

394
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:35,380
Craig night or who was publisher

395
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,750
track online he was passed

396
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,200
document that somebody downloaded of an
internal phone company system

397
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,330
a very boring and bureaucratic document
that involve the enhanced 911 service

398
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,658
it didn't really have any technical
value to it at all

399
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,139
but since it had to do with the
emergency phone system

400
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:01,529
the government seized upon this and try
to prosecute

401
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:06,080
Craig an alleged cause the thousand
dollars worth of damage

402
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,439
which was I think if

403
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,429
I remember correctly was was was
BellSouth

404
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,110
tally on the the amount of money it's ok
to

405
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,450
right the document hire the people to
write

406
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:25,080
document documentation system was used
to write document and all these things

407
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,990
absolutely nothing to do with Kreger
anything else

408
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,450
and noms its drag on for a long time

409
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,210
particular case ultimately it was
dismissed because

410
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,110
which is complete list and because it
turned out that document was a

411
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,590
readily available for sale by Bill Self
for a nominal fee

412
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,600
well

413
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,830
yeah life freeze for valor would cost at
FedEx

414
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,970
the realities so yet it just goes to
show that the stuff can be

415
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,320
wildly blown out of proportion of it is
%ah

416
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,070
sometimes I think parents sometimes
malice

417
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:06,110
sometimes at a just they just wanna when
a case is it's not so much about

418
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,019
the Justice aspect om I've

419
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:14,010
one of the hardest thing for me to learn
going through this are my experience was

420
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:17,600
that accepting the fact that now

421
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,429
the judicial system is necessarily about
justice it's about winning the case

422
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:25,169
om and like things that

423
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:28,279
ways we used we're used to thinking
where logic

424
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:33,429
common sense fairness justice where
these things there

425
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:38,470
ideals that we tend to think along those
lines not only do they really applied

426
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,929
there not even part of the equation

427
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,039
in many cases when it comes to these
cases because it's

428
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,529
government wants to win the case and the
awful to say or do what they must

429
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:51,809
to do that to win and a it's an
adversarial system is prolly

430
00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,549
want the better legal systems in the
world but you know is an adversarial

431
00:25:55,549 --> 00:25:56,210
system in

432
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,399
each cycle do it has to win at that time

433
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,039
damages related directly

434
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,139
yeah how much time you sir

435
00:26:06,139 --> 00:26:09,370
Kevin the same thing happened on even

436
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,690
never distributed source code once

437
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,940
other companies

438
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,710
on when they came to assess damages they
determine

439
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:24,240
the damages worthy all the R&D costs
that were involved in creating

440
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,379
this sorts millions and millions of
dollars

441
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:31,679
and that's why Sir on time because
federal sentencing guidelines

442
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,899
time damage they have a chart it's
really worth reading some time the

443
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:40,399
United States s Inc Sentencing
Commission %ah

444
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,760
has a chart guidelines and that really
guidelines that basically

445
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,289
the rules judges were basically %ah

446
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,629
emasculated from it other

447
00:26:52,629 --> 00:26:55,960
their power was taken away from them in
in

448
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,119
making any kind decisions about the link
the senses they're basically

449
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:05,289
your scored your fancy scored by a base
offense level depending on the statute

450
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:06,059
%ah

451
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,960
and they're sometimes hands fence if
there's prior criminal history that

452
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,139
enhance a certain amount

453
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:13,909
another access to the grid and then
there's the set

454
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:16,039
there's other all these other
enhancements like it there's more than

455
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,470
minimal planning or for use in Eq
specific skill

456
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,220
that was not commonly possessed you know
all kinds of things they can throw in a

457
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,970
topic to enhance the score

458
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,950
but in in fraud in cases like all of
ours where

459
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,010
they can see that was fraudulent even
know

460
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,129
it might be alleged that there was no
the we could be says

461
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:38,320
real estate pro actually are getting all
over cases that %ah

462
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,590
nervous actually had committed fraud on

463
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,470
it doesn't matter that statute is still
considered to be fraud related so

464
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,090
there's this other sure they have

465
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,350
which %uh depending on the dollar amount
of the fraud alleged

466
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,760
%ah the the sentences are increased by
so many more months

467
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,470
if you look at this grid I don't have it
here this is great chart

468
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,909
in a if it millions of dollars your
senses like of the shorts

469
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,899
and they use this they can't anymore but
they did use this

470
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:12,419
and I think probably already cases be
able to throw these wild figures

471
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:16,539
our on to sort of compel you to plead
our

472
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:20,450
on because that potential sentence you
to get is just

473
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,309
life ending me not literally but
figuratively

474
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:27,490
so on there was a really important case
that came down

475
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,510
for the Supreme Court a couple years ago

476
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,369
om where a it was ruled unconstitutional

477
00:28:35,369 --> 00:28:40,529
%ah tactics that were used in in Kevin's
case marks case in my case

478
00:28:40,529 --> 00:28:43,539
on and what it really amounts to is a

479
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,980
in the sentencing phase well first of
all and in

480
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,990
in the in the litigation phase the
government can say

481
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,179
to your your you in your counsel we're
gonna use this this this and this

482
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:00,149
and if we win now we can tell the judge

483
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:03,389
that we also think he did this this this
and this and this

484
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:07,200
and news those also we think you did
this this this and this this

485
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,429
don't have to be proven or didn't have
to be proven didn't know

486
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,639
has been kinda investigation go on how
much Frogger

487
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:17,779
how much dollar loss was actually
involved

488
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:21,539
and at the at the sentencing stage the
judge can

489
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:25,149
can or how much cash to buy by law but
follow these

490
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:30,690
these guidelines to accept verbatim what
the prosecution says the government says

491
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:33,840
because there's no standard if evidence
is now standard prufer the sentencing

492
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,779
phase like there is a trial

493
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,850
so you have this weird again Alice in
Wonderland situation where

494
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,470
on he will plead out on

495
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:46,549
or you take your chances in trial

496
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:50,070
and if they win just one count have
anything

497
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,700
if some of the count indictment bennett
sensing face again throwing all this

498
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,899
other stuff

499
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,639
you might not even be charged with and
that stuff

500
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:02,549
without any real burden of proof in the
government %ah can be used

501
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,350
to enhance your settings too many years
and this uses a set legal sledgehammer I

502
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:06,769
think

503
00:30:06,769 --> 00:30:10,299
up until this is ruled unconstitutional
a couple years ago

504
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:14,610
screen court case completely first
Washington

505
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:18,059
and now %ah

506
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:21,799
it's really turn this system upside down
is now

507
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:25,480
it's really change how US Attorney's

508
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,320
can present this stuff to judges
basically the the law decided

509
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,980
the Supreme Court ruled it a I am

510
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,510
I will 524 that the Sixth Amendment
right to a jury trial

511
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,629
prohibits judges from enhancing criminal
sentences

512
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,639
based on facts other than those decided
by the jury

513
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:47,929
or confessed to buy the defendant that's
real important thing because

514
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,240
was just uses such as fictitious
sledgehammer

515
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,470
in a in so many cases including ours the
to

516
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:56,940
they can't quite get away with that
they're so some things they can wiggle

517
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,629
room they have on this but it was

518
00:30:58,629 --> 00:31:02,320
it's the main reason that the federal
government thing has a but he's a 97

519
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,139
percent conviction rate

520
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:07,349
because you will plead guilty or

521
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:12,559
your if could be over effectively and
people make a deal just because you know

522
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,168
a year five years or ten years twenty
years may sound better than a less

523
00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:17,460
stressful life in prison

524
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,460
which could happen

525
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,990
I on said you find in your case is that
that

526
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,190
that sort of scenario played out without
your costar see

527
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,340
you're familiar kevin's case intimately
so I mean country ran into that

528
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,960
that he already told you I'm sure that
it to

529
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,000
that was that was part of the
decision-making process for him

530
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,200
the play out as well and tape

531
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,480
some basic years robbing trials

532
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,950
where you know for Kevin there was

533
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:03,049
wire fraud for each phone

534
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:06,070
and so they basically came down like

535
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:13,070
take this deal we're just going to ship
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction

536
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,090
it still be on the bus absolutely

537
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,379
said after

538
00:32:20,379 --> 00:32:24,549
long time he did

539
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:27,649
five years in prison

540
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:30,780
yet three years of supervised release
that and

541
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,109
January of 2003 he is only help by one
condition

542
00:32:35,109 --> 00:32:40,190
agreement which expires 2007

543
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:43,220
we get these in a in chronological order

544
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,820
at that because I believe you were your
charge first

545
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,099
believes and then a havin although he
had a prior conviction

546
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:53,250
the the big case came after the raleigh
case yeah

547
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,520
95 when North Carolina after me and then

548
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,629
shortly after have his case a I came
down the road

549
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:04,000
and a mine was kinda weird in a way that

550
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,169
what I was charged with with with doing
on

551
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:12,349
wasn't really illegal when I'm had
started doing it

552
00:33:12,349 --> 00:33:16,869
%ah there is a new federal statute was
enacted in late ninety four

553
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,990
something in a fight with called kaliya
the communications act for law

554
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,409
enforcement assistance

555
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:24,529
and the big party that this legislation
was too

556
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:28,299
you know basically finder nationwide

557
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,450
wiretapping infrastructure are your tax
dollars

558
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:34,820
on and as we know his

559
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,330
grown even more sense on

560
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,940
but one of the little tiny things that
was added to this

561
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,840
this big body legislation called kaliya
was a little modification

562
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,149
to law

563
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:54,369
title 18 section 10:29 which was

564
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:59,629
primarily related to

565
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:05,230
uses access devices and access devices
by statute meant

566
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,429
like any card could plate workout number

567
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:12,109
it's the legal definition just anything
that would allow you to use

568
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:16,250
a telecommunications service without
authorizations no spoofing sympathetic a

569
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:16,879
shiner

570
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,569
or just on you know using a credit card

571
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:23,879
calling card number that was in your
something like that so they added

572
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,139
a few lines in that was very obscure
nobody really knew about it

573
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:31,560
on this thing was pasts it ninety now

574
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,909
and nobody really noticed your notices
tiny little thing was it

575
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:38,049
added in there that basically made it a
felony to possess

576
00:34:38,049 --> 00:34:41,849
now made it a felony to possess and I'm
gonna codex possess

577
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:45,089
hardware or software for the
modification

578
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:49,440
of telecommunications instruments for
the unauthorized access

579
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,770
to telecommunication services 90 that's
a mouthful

580
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,089
but if you think about it was that mean
it means basically

581
00:34:56,089 --> 00:34:59,150
it became felony to possess

582
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,619
any hardware or any software

583
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,680
that could be used to program something

584
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,560
that or to physically modify something
that then could be used

585
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,000
to access some sort of health education
system

586
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,369
without authorization and I thought to
myself

587
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:20,690
well when I was first charged with this
first running ahead turned out to be

588
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,080
real loser

589
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:26,660
on he said this law doesn't exist if
this this is no such law

590
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,009
and it turns out that had just been an
active few weeks reforms charged with it

591
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,010
was incurred a lot worse yet

592
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,480
on but it was law and I I try to keep up
on this stuff and i'd

593
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,119
I didn't know about it I turn even know
about it and I didn't have access to any

594
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,250
current law books in prison that had

595
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:45,250
had any record of this new law so was
really weird situation to be in for a

596
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,349
few weeks that

597
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,720
in charge the crime I didn't think
existed

598
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,190
so on any level we found it did exist

599
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,740
in a what I was a up I won't go into
much about the case for basic I was

600
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,569
charged with

601
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:02,369
possession idi red box and a modified
touchdown Tyler

602
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:06,670
and possession of software which I gave
away

603
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,359
right here at this very spot

604
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:13,380
back and ninety

605
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,930
94 the first half conference fact about

606
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,290
10 feet away from 10 feet behind me is
where I gave away the software that

607
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,970
allows you to create an extension of
yourself an

608
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,920
armpit did not give you the ability to a
change other peoples like tracks your

609
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,779
numbers in

610
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:31,460
and clone their fans you have to know
with electronics remember was

611
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,869
and program that with a with the the man
the senator from number

612
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:39,660
into a phone so they sickly I am I miss
offer available for free to people

613
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,129
and a I if if they wanted to buy manual
or a cable I'd say lets him for a

614
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,349
nominal fee

615
00:36:45,349 --> 00:36:49,069
basically role extension other cell
phone and a

616
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:51,940
you know I did that for a while it's a
lot of people had happy even if that

617
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,770
around in

618
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:56,599
I didn't have to hand now distributed
and and a lot of people weren't there

619
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:59,540
were downloading files over the internet
that well so it was on and a pimple

620
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,869
import systems and things like that and
then I thought and

621
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:05,299
had been accomplished what I want to do
is that make this available to people

622
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:08,020
cuz I just thought it was unfair for the
cell phone companies to say

623
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:12,290
well you can have a second self n we are
paying another monthly fee

624
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,670
for for user their network another 30
bucks a month when

625
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:19,510
you're in your own home you can plug in
as many fans as you want and

626
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,650
make all the calls you want as many fans
as you want and it's all gonna end up on

627
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,690
your account

628
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,049
to not feel you have yourself an account
just didn't make sense to me

629
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:30,180
by on you know was a revenue source for
them I guess that

630
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:33,470
the other thing I was charged with the
again was the

631
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,310
the lie I was selling crystals for five
dollars

632
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,420
United 2600 magazine because a someone

633
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,799
not me figured out that you can modify
reduced to texting dollar

634
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:49,380
to assimilate the sounds of points going
into a payphone

635
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,690
I guess replacing that the time in
Crystal City shifted the frequency

636
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,500
the texan's up and it did a pretty good
moving jobs that

637
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,369
and a a manual I were talking about that
once in a

638
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:04,230
we thought it might be a good idea to to
make his face was available to people

639
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,400
more readily than

640
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,330
having order them for RadioShack
RadioShack leave and sell them to you it

641
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,839
was a standard crystal value

642
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,920
but was a special order thing yet wait a
couple weeks and

643
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,810
so I just had his company make a bunch
crystals that were sup many incise

644
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,509
easier

645
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:20,690
now inside a touchdown Tyler and

646
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,720
mail them off to people with long with
instruction sheet had my five touchdown

647
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,770
Tyler

648
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:30,509
and I would make these crystals are on
Moda and unmodified dollar selling by

649
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:34,819
hear from Radio Shack discounter from
flea markets or whatever

650
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:38,609
and make them available 2600 meeting
said the builder and red boxes

651
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:43,619
and one kid bill on that

652
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:47,359
the cold side right in work very well
cell I to the back from

653
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,960
gave another unmodified I learned
crystal and said now you got it

654
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,230
just how you decide and that one ended
up being in my possession

655
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,480
as I was charged with with possessing a
a modified touched and I'll

656
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:03,010
it was that one but they were able to
secret service was able to

657
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,220
get it to work somehow and so

658
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,080
I was charged with that but on

659
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,490
wanna be a 10 things I want to mention
about the case to is the year

660
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:19,430
the wording the statute was so they
that's a

661
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:23,839
back to the definition I to said about
modifications hardware/software

662
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,650
or possessing tools thereof I thought
this could be applied to anything a

663
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:27,529
modem

664
00:39:27,529 --> 00:39:31,549
or a terminal emulator built into
Microsoft Windows

665
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:34,080
could be used to access a
telecommunication system without

666
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,310
authorization

667
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:39,080
with such a vague vague wording and

668
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,310
I get agreed to plead guilty ultimately
after

669
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:47,080
many months %ah because the federal
prosecutor my case told my attorney

670
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:50,950
that what they were going to do is when
I was found guilty in

671
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,040
no question i'd be found guilty cuz I
greed II didn't

672
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,710
I never dispute the fact that I did
possess hardware and software that could

673
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,339
have been missed misused

674
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:02,830
I guess was arguing that I never called
anyone else a cell phone

675
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:07,000
I never committed any cell phone fraud I
never sold the red box

676
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,380
anybody on well I did use red boxes I
hadn't

677
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,250
admitted to that but I did know that
have all the money I never ever plug and

678
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:19,390
pay fines and not got change back the
phone company was still ahead of the

679
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,299
game

680
00:40:21,299 --> 00:40:24,900
but that doesn't quite follow factor
into their they're thinking

681
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:28,790
so on with the federal government said
they were going to do with a

682
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:31,839
charge me with a frog dollar amount
based on their

683
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,730
estimate that everyone who bought a
crystalline made it rain a red box

684
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,160
parts and made available om or obtained
a copy this offer and they were talking

685
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,868
about thousands of copies a software
that people have gotten copies of copies

686
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:45,029
of copies of

687
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:48,509
on third fourth generation copies or
whatever

688
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:52,119
arm that all this could have been used
to

689
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,720
up cause so many millions of dollars
worth of with a fried

690
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,410
which I'm responsible for and that that
on the chart would bring you up into

691
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:03,850
you know years and years and years in
prison and I have no way to

692
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,859
to dispute that before this plate Levi
Siver rushing case was

693
00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:10,049
ruled unconstitutional a to dispute that

694
00:41:10,049 --> 00:41:12,790
no I should be response was that I
didn't I'm not responsible for other

695
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,109
peoples actions

696
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:17,710
but so I played out on and observing

697
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,869
about 14 months in five different

698
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:25,920
five different reasons you're in a
federal prison camp

699
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,950
and pretty imposing looking place we we
ended up to

700
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:33,430
meeting up with some other friends

701
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,730
in philadelphia I live a few days before
you were to report me

702
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:41,710
we drove up there in actually is a crazy
blizzard ice storm

703
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:45,009
storm it was yeah I'm even though I'm

704
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:49,359
from right here in new york you could
really and almost anywhere

705
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,650
on on the east coast or even even in the
midwest

706
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,960
it's over I was I was basically a sign
to go

707
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,069
Pennsylvania just purely coincidental so
we went and stayed with

708
00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:04,580
with at the weekend before a supposed to
report with a great

709
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,250
great couple three days and it he got a
couple days stay of execution is sends

710
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,650
because

711
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,339
the roads were so bad the governor s
risks claiming that nobody can be in the

712
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:16,390
driving on the road is that that is

713
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:21,140
and so we are calling a we have calling
to prison

714
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,440
from my home and saying a like

715
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,950
like I did some social engineering I
said I was his lawyer and

716
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,380
the governor's governor saying that
people should not be driving

717
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:36,609
%ah in these counties and that we didn't
want to violate the law by going against

718
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:37,869
the governor's order

719
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:41,109
so we ended up spending a couple extra
days altogether

720
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:44,960
having a good time for we checked in
many ways I got the treacherous

721
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,270
icy roads to get there and was like the
middle the night when we got there and

722
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,650
was ice all over the place in

723
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,830
took us like an hour to figure out how
to get you into the place

724
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:57,049
the place looks like I was shut down and
we got a video the whole thing was like

725
00:42:57,049 --> 00:42:59,080
this bizarre surreal

726
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,830
weird thing tried get him into prison
like we had to really try

727
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:09,640
right down to the wire okay we have time
to take some questions

728
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:16,640
okay we get sick three questions

729
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,269
was like

730
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:21,549
what did you do in prison who is your
daily life life

731
00:43:21,549 --> 00:43:25,019
was the weekends like you that make
phone calls

732
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,380
you able to hack the phone calls a play

733
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,710
frank says the charts there's this morn
P questions but

734
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,210
but let's I can try to answer

735
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:38,569
really quickly on for market I

736
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:42,099
from marken I a had different
experiences

737
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:45,470
up at Kevin and I had similar
experiences from the standpoint of a

738
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:48,470
mark was aware the length of his
sentence

739
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:51,799
before he went in before got locked up
generates

740
00:43:51,799 --> 00:43:54,660
said he knew he had light at the end of
the tunnel he knew he was gonna get here

741
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,839
today to look forward to

742
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:59,078
and Kevin's case in my case it was a

743
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:04,249
it was a tunnel with no light at the end
and that's really a psychologically

744
00:44:04,249 --> 00:44:08,880
com has a strong psychological impact
when you're literally locked into the

745
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,549
cage

746
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:12,650
some in the cages I was locked into are

747
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:16,390
were this were 45 by eight feet and that
was

748
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,509
room for that includes a

749
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:23,269
metal bed a toilet and a sink lol
cabinet to put your

750
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:27,650
toiletries in so figure that out you're
locked into something like that

751
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:32,809
on with no idea how long you gonna be
there for a long long time

752
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:36,720
and I think that a mass a tortured a
certain answer immense

753
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,989
certainly when you're held without bail
as I wasn't as kevin was

754
00:44:39,989 --> 00:44:43,009
four-and-a-half years yeah it's just it
just you know this is something you

755
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:43,849
would attribute to

756
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:48,390
to third world countries and now
wouldn't call this political prisoners

757
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,788
but it's kinda thing you hear about

758
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:53,700
happening in other countries like how
can they do that yet we couldn't

759
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,789
ever study like that do something like
that in america so

760
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:01,789
to answer cat crunchies question on ken
is my spirits I think we're

761
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:05,700
were harrowing from standpoint you don't
know how long you gonna be there

762
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,829
on idea also was in

763
00:45:08,829 --> 00:45:12,160
I was in a different kind to prisons in
that weather third is considered maxine

764
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,690
skaters

765
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,369
or media max where I was in there with
murderers and mob bosses and

766
00:45:17,369 --> 00:45:20,910
things like that and you were in a sorta
white-collar

767
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:24,980
highness well I was in them in a minimum
security facility

768
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,579
even though some people refer to as a
camp you're not gonna sing songs

769
00:45:28,579 --> 00:45:32,450
I not attack on and there's no

770
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,239
not a nice place century to popular
belief this testing is camp said

771
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,890
we go there and there's there's tennis
courts and swimming pools

772
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,558
that's complete bullshit I was created
by Holly there's no such thing

773
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:47,569
prison is present the only difference
between a minimum security and higher

774
00:45:47,569 --> 00:45:48,308
security

775
00:45:48,309 --> 00:45:52,200
is you have limited to free movement and
at certain times

776
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,309
you're not allowed to go anywhere but
there are certain times when you have

777
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:58,980
more or less free movement throughout
the facility that's the only difference

778
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,559
at all

779
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:03,759
at the end to the night you can't leave
it still present and

780
00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:07,160
really the only the thing that's common
in all the time is

781
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,859
its psychologically it's a real train
you could be in a small cell

782
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:16,200
obviously that's a larger psychological
train but knowing that you can't go home

783
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,579
or you know see the people you wanna be
with them and so on

784
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,630
its its really difficult period

785
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:26,210
on maybe one more question 12 for
questions okay

786
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:29,259
I have a question back here thanks up

787
00:46:29,259 --> 00:46:33,329
I was wondering if you guys were able to
seek damages after the ruling came down

788
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:36,339
that no further evidence could be
admitted

789
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,808
or like used in your sentencing after
the trial

790
00:46:39,809 --> 00:46:43,759
with the jury well it there were there
have an appeals other people's views

791
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,940
that likely first watch anything but
it's just

792
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,999
who want to go back and visit all if it
not that it's

793
00:46:48,999 --> 00:46:52,259
no what would be a Pyrrhic victory
victory if you want because you know

794
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:53,009
what you're out now

795
00:46:53,009 --> 00:46:56,289
so was you don't you don't win lawsuits
against federal government in these

796
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,039
kinds of things and you get a lot of
money raising

797
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:02,460
just you just wanna put it behind you
yeah I mean the best thing to do after

798
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,299
prison is just to forget about Pres

799
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:08,579
there's no there's no real sense
dwelling on it if you can take anything

800
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:10,619
from the experience and grow from it

801
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,739
do so by I mean don't make your life's
purpose to get all

802
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:18,069
make stopping legal process and the
Bureau of Prisons

803
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,230
because there's just no sense to you
need to move on with your life

804
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,749
and that in itself becomes a a former
prison try to deal with this on

805
00:47:24,749 --> 00:47:27,930
I did file an appeal but my pill was
while I was still locked up

806
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,430
appealing the constitutionality of the
statute but i wasnt we were really

807
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,299
allowed to make an oral arguments

808
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:37,420
or in any case law that hit by any case
law has just been decided just after the

809
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,339
deadline for submitting it
communications decency act was

810
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:43,910
similar to my case in big statue that
telecommunications

811
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:47,719
terms and stuff like that but you just
after they just wanted

812
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:50,859
is make it go away and in get all your
life

813
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:55,038
my own a question

814
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,339
that's a question after

815
00:47:58,339 --> 00:48:02,279
after prison after restricted on parole
and so forth know perot

816
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:06,819
no pro know there's no parole in the
federal system of their restrictions on

817
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:11,989
computer use things like that electronic
your best

818
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:16,769
mom well I myself didn't have any
restrictions as far as using computers

819
00:48:16,769 --> 00:48:21,259
neither did I after the fact only only
Kevin did to my knowledge

820
00:48:21,259 --> 00:48:25,880
I did have restrictions on travel that
did affect my work its first

821
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:31,019
being mad I was a consultant

822
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:34,239
other than that really I didn't I didn't
have issues as far as

823
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,339
me a lot of people sent the books and
magazines and

824
00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:41,940
materials while I was in prison someone
got limited

825
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,999
or confiscated and others were not sorta

826
00:48:44,999 --> 00:48:49,489
random there was no real reason behind
it but luckily I was able to stay fairly

827
00:48:49,489 --> 00:48:50,390
up today

828
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:55,469
in the time that I lost address you gave
a final comment

829
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:58,809
actually

830
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:02,890
Kevin lot of people sent things while he
was in prison

831
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,098
%ah printed out things from the internet
and so

832
00:49:06,099 --> 00:49:10,309
caught up that way one course he was
restricted

833
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:14,170
not just computers any time electronics

834
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,390
everything had to be cleared 30

835
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,299
just and they do stuff like stop by your
work place

836
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:24,579
stuff like you know are kinda crazy
stuff the message here for years

837
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:28,329
but a I defy thank everybody I think for
Kevin I will thank everybody

838
00:49:28,329 --> 00:49:31,880
and I think market a lot of the lot of
just how I think everybody who

839
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,440
didn't finish come here today I Hope but
who sent us letters of support

840
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,230
and support also a very we were all very
fortunate from a standpoint have

841
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,509
we had huge numbers of people who didn't
even know a supporting it and keeping

842
00:49:43,509 --> 00:49:44,980
that moral thing going

843
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,650
keep the moral support going was
extremely important to me I'm sure to

844
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:49,019
Kevin answered

845
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,210
it was that's what kept us going we're
really lucky for all you folks to have

846
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,900
support us because most people they
don't get that we just happen to know

847
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,480
the right people
