1
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,580
based on everyone's what we're gonna
talk about today's developing software

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,250
without revealing your identity

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,180
basically sitting on a software
development creating identity in

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,690
cyberspace did people aren't able track
back your actual

5
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,430
real identity in the real world her
meets face uh...

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,589
nor to protect yourself

7
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:28,419
uh...

8
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,010
from a camera tribution for robin kind
of software that you

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:33,300
want to write

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,540
more more restrictions are coming under
freedom of speech informa source code

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,430
and this is one potential solution uh...

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,360
that i think

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,589
might be beneficial to those of us who
wanna rates often may not be popular may

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,319
not be

15
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,630
uh... sanctioned

16
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,350
what is uh... soon i was told it was
basically

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,650
again development it's tied back to it

18
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,390
identifier

19
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,219
a large city

20
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,030
clearly easily uniquely identified in
cyberspace

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,670
but as the price that to the real world
anyone can

22
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,000
determine without a extra money effort
already used to talk to days pgp keys

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
and pgp key i_d_'s

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,760
uh... pgp key ideas basically

25
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,470
hale of the hash of the key material

26
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,960
for pgp version for two shot won some

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,520
of basically your public information so
its

28
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,220
not guaranteed to be unique but its
unique enough for us for our purposes

29
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,550
i will also talk about strong
distribution

30
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:26,850
and strong distribution is

31
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,270
uh... cryptographic model of

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,860
districting software

33
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,130
so that software can be easily modified
or uh... misrepresented

34
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,880
or damage transit

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,320
basically protecting everything that you
stripping our expectations with public

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,549
key signatures

37
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:48,760
on our case pgp uh... jealousies they do
this with exile nine certificates

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,380
most commonly you know people are
familiar with the patches offer

39
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,039
foundation these pgp pretty extensively
to

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,150
you know protector

41
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,529
uh... suffer archives their releases and

42
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:59,459
here in their security communications

43
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,350
uh... expo ninety good example of people
using exile animes microsoft

44
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,369
but they do a lot of their signatures
they have it on c_ a_ n_

45
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:09,889
basically any update you download from
microsoft has signed with their expo

46
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:12,779
ninety two ticket

47
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:14,939
why do we need it welcome

48
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,849
we've got a terrible patent system
that's been broken for a long time

49
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:21,839
that's very kisi to accidentally

50
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:23,919
you know violate a patent and

51
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,729
you were a repercussions of violating a
patent

52
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,419
lawsuits are a big problem for
developers these days if she

53
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,540
accidentally violate a patent just
matias

54
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,659
computing

55
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,400
uh... methods and models

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,149
that i would

57
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:40,549
read the terms coverage there
mathematical trees impacted so things

58
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:41,560
like x or

59
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,800
you know acts or black and white

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,469
black or white pixels eyes actually
patented

61
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:48,359
so if you do you

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,390
violate a patent

63
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,469
and your sign your name on your source
code

64
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,219
uh...

65
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,638
you're open to a lawsuit

66
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,799
uh... you can even face imprisonment now
in the united states for some things now

67
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:00,249
the tulip digital millennium copyright
act you know his has made some pretty

68
00:03:00,249 --> 00:03:02,439
strict uh...

69
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,929
limitations only news first reverse
engineering and uh...

70
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:10,019
bring certain kinds of code uh... things
like uh... dec assess a lot of us are

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,409
familiar with

72
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,179
jayaram skip jack was a big thing a few
years ago

73
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,219
basically uh... trip our people back or
for the government

74
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:23,228
if you were to try and inviolate debt or
make a leash of that back door

75
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,979
developers on are of course open to
lawsuits for trade secrets of their

76
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:30,989
to employers may have

77
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:33,999
not so bad in some states like
california whichever right-to-work law

78
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,170
but in many other states

79
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,779
in the united states right now

80
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:39,839
what she worked for a company doing
specific thing you know maybe high

81
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,859
availability failover or certain kinds
of operations to restore shoes on

82
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,520
uh... it's very difficult to for example
star shown company record prime

83
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,999
consultant

84
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:51,879
some pretty extreme liability risks
uh...

85
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:53,749
again it did

86
00:03:53,749 --> 00:03:54,459
the m_c_a_

87
00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,590
um... brea his suit a lot of people by
m_p_a_a_ is also considering it a lot of

88
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,069
companies and shut down in the future
world a lot of lawsuits unwaged

89
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,979
announcers are really good example

90
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,909
uh... there's a few other companies in
australia

91
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,099
that have had some problems

92
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,549
and you'd have to be concerned about
unintended usage if you really separate

93
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,639
if you're sharing program for example
with your real identity tied to it

94
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,159
turns out that that program is premier
li used by your users by people you

95
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,610
don't even know and maybe didn't write a
program for

96
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,620
to distribute

97
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,140
pirated software pirated music uh...

98
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,949
you could face in my ability there ubi

99
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:33,219
a burn up on you to prove that you did
not write the software is primarily a

100
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,639
prior sexual

101
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,580
uh... there's other sources of chilling
effects right now and source code

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,318
uh... and computer programming

103
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,090
uh... clear mission tunisian as one of
the biggest ones that i've personally

104
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,530
face and it's like

105
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,040
these were afraid of university a public
state university in florida

106
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,469
and uh...

107
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:52,129
universities have in a bit of an
identity crisis over whether it was a

108
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:54,310
public university to educate students or

109
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,550
a private incubator to launch startup
companies

110
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,309
not university that i worked at but one
of the ones in the same university

111
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:04,240
system a six-day actually put a graduate
student and present because he uh...

112
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,260
refused to turn over invention which he
hadn't made in chemical engineering

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,539
after leaving the school

114
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,349
when you're working for these
universities are you researcher are you

115
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,789
not or uh... are united five employees
and what you do work

116
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,610
uses

117
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,919
the property of your employer

118
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:24,258
i did you become the property of the the
institution and you work for or the

119
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,529
company you know

120
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,599
brady is the property twenty four seven
and

121
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,050
what about after you leave uh...

122
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,590
anders even the problem with the
american system of law suit right now

123
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,770
you're black maternal american

124
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,448
entitlement liability the idea that

125
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,300
the authors of the game print that
automate responsible some steals a car

126
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,040
or that doom you know

127
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,230
software programmers

128
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,720
might and responsible for the columbine
shootings and they're actually civil

129
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,069
lawsuits like and

130
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:53,710
that's a tremendous financial burden so

131
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,180
you really got a case of two answers

132
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,020
uh... the government

133
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,498
wage

134
00:05:59,499 --> 00:06:00,970
a lot of people uh...

135
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,919
will tell you go i don't think the
government can break stalk country i

136
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,188
don't think the government can factura
large numbers i'd

137
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:08,430
i don't think that they have hung
contributors and i i can hold the

138
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,400
opposite view i think that the
government can break strong biography i

139
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,469
think they can break arce i think they
can factor up to four thousand i'm sixty

140
00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:17,989
you know that keys i think that uh...

141
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:21,149
people really endorsement in their cup
capabilities um...

142
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,159
whenever right

143
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,319
do something in cricket i consider it

144
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,909
uh... given that the government to be
able to read it anytime someone q

145
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:31,269
more interesting in the emissaries
corporations

146
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:32,779
uh... your employer

147
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,349
uh... companies out there who uh...
heartbreaking similar projects

148
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:39,280
to the peace offer that you're
developing companies that make home

149
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,740
the market right now for the suffer that
you're developing

150
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,930
the really limited

151
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,449
uh... by their own property in terms of
their ability to break pgp keys or

152
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,090
you know demo number of lawyers on our
staff for back and i think so

153
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,330
if you're working with ps suffer this
deal with smaller companies may not be a

154
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,650
big deal uh...

155
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,599
diluted by borders for example if you
outside of uh...

156
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,900
united states is a lot more difficult
for u_s_ company did to have any kind of

157
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,149
are retribution asinine you for writing
stuff for the day we shoot night

158
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:10,309
they can attend to become a stack form
but it's not reform

159
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:13,189
so what do most people do in the face
this chilling affects a lot of people

160
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,629
just don't write any code anymore alice
is really into the strong case for

161
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,959
people i think working middle very large
companies like i_b_m_ sana stuff like

162
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,580
that

163
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,339
they're just not participating anymore
and if we saw for community

164
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:26,590
they send small patches but that's not
named

165
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,069
uh... from the developer and

166
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:31,340
that's a little prom because of trusting
the person developing software not

167
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,809
included ever not to close appeared on

168
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,610
trying to treat in secret without
actually having

169
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,120
mathematics behind your back you up and
force that secrecy is is a major problem

170
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,000
you can try and separate your online
identity in this is this is going to

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,759
miss a lot you know how do you separate
you're my space profile or something

172
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,520
like that from you know who you actually
are in the world to keep it from the

173
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,039
back and you've got to say i want to say
i'm mailing lists website remember of

174
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,159
animated political parties that you've
contributed too and that's it

175
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:01,938
you can get together for sitting in that

176
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,989
there's no strength left the city a lot
of people have had synonyms unmasked in

177
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:09,929
your newspaper articles written about
and what they've done online

178
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,929
you know what happens if your children
exposed twelve you're reading software

179
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:16,279
uh... lawsuit certainly a possibility
uh...

180
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:19,189
there's your job possibilities very
difficult to get hired obviously if

181
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:20,569
you've been fired for uh...

182
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,620
silly trade secrets or something like
that even you know if you we're actually

183
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,429
doing it

184
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:28,389
so that's that's is up to the starkest
is what model could you use if you want

185
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,930
rights operable wanna make sure you
wouldn't be discovered

186
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,930
on terms of the government problem as
one of the kind of national free state

187
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,440
project

188
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,200
it's it's really great project and i
think it's really the only way that we

189
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,100
can deal with the government minister we
kinda have right now the united states

190
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,879
and all the terrible things are
happening

191
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:49,069
uh... to be a screen effort to get
people to move to a single state and

192
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:52,180
antenna reduced a part of the federal
government in that state

193
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,000
so i'm a member of a kind really
encourage all to take a look at it

194
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,980
because it's it's

195
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,490
not to get any israeli government really
i really do think that

196
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,710
they can break chunk of concrete you
know that

197
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,590
the idea of trickle in turkey is a nice
romantic idea and it's for the call to

198
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,280
think about and and and kind of play
with your head but

199
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,020
you know it into the day we really don't
know their capabilities and

200
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,199
their life rather invest in our seven
histories proven that

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,140
so uh... actually did let's get their
hands dirtier water the core components

202
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,470
necessary to do

203
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,260
synonymous development

204
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,900
what we need a key server infrastructure
and we're good they're got a few

205
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,510
different uh... networks

206
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,410
unanimous written email infrastructure
uh... mix master from the site for parks

207
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,040
anonymous posting infrastructure now we
have enough he's like a ways so we can

208
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,550
use she's and use distribute things like
uh... security uh... advisories and

209
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,519
you released nelson some things like
that

210
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,629
uh... it's actually just read us offer
our 'cause themselves if we get there

211
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:47,720
too large to use use that easily

212
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,040
uh... we have on your running
infrastructure now uniformed or and a

213
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,990
lot of the pure prepare networks are
trying to pick up on your outing

214
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,970
the first you need to do is create an
identity

215
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,840
uh... as i said where he's open pgp for
this demonstration

216
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,390
uh... and basically all you have to do
is jerry pgp key with no identity

217
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,780
information in it

218
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,600
so if you look at the top white box at
the screen and you can see that that's a

219
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,640
two dozen forty-eight uh... are shaky
uh...

220
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,630
justin emphasis not on the stacker it
has no email address the way to contact

221
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,530
back you can put everyone with the pgp
key uh... pgp key format is basically a

222
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,030
single packet that identify subversion

223
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:32,069
national ke material date was generated
engage expires uh...

224
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,350
is you've got a sub key down there how
we can meeting broke eight some keys so

225
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,960
you don't have to expire publicly

226
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,610
if we look at the second box richer
that's uh...

227
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,500
punky from one of the apache uh...
developers i copied off the web in you

228
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,590
can see there then

229
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,130
itself

230
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,050
deeply integrate into the well of cross
and that's a very important thing we

231
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,000
need to do if you are

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,260
if you plan to use pgp keys for software
franken trust

233
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,270
and you can see that

234
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,140
the way you would in analyzed this world
crust immigration as you look at the

235
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,310
different signatures

236
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,850
and you can see that

237
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,529
musician to vary based on date

238
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,990
there there's a lot of uh...

239
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:08,190
a lot of differences there between you
know they're not all the same day

240
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,830
they're not very recent if you actually
to go to actually look at the different

241
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,600
peapod keys that are signatures of the
primary key there

242
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,120
uh... mister stryker city

243
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,100
you would look for larger were
signatures on those keys as well as you

244
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,449
tracing back to more levels across that
you go through the world trust

245
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,000
other more sure you can be

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,150
uh... that those are valid signatures

247
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,329
you definite wanna put yelp but no
signatures on it for signatures are

248
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,830
usually i identifiable is as accurate

249
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,690
because then someone kitna

250
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,730
can publish it keep its not gorky and
representative jerky and then they can

251
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,060
represent their softwares yourself when
they can put things in there like

252
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,790
you may be

253
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,290
source code erases the disc you know
viruses those kinds of problems of body

254
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,839
back to work

255
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,560
when you go through the weather across
which are actually looking at is what's

256
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,970
represented by this graph here this is a
graph of the philadelphia lets users

257
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,240
group uh...

258
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,080
and i think it just because it's it's
uh...

259
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,300
it's a nice will trust its burden

260
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:05,900
bi-directional you know people who have
paid their key sign of all societies

261
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,560
that people who signed the peace so
that's a good indication that they do

262
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,560
know each other that they've met in
person it

263
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,560
uh... a lot of one-way heroes here which
indicates that

264
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,060
the person has signed a key but has an
turkey sign and return

265
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,000
uh... there's a lot of links you can see

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,270
different strands how each one of the
black arrows represents a signature on

267
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,720
up

268
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,120
uh... pgp key

269
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,910
the keys are color based on the number
of senators who have on them

270
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,370
you honey signatures do you need a
mickey

271
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,970
really uh... whether to trust to cure
not as a personal decision use twenty

272
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,380
people as much

273
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,330
motivation if you can't eat russia keys
actually years electronic from nobody

274
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,030
can signatures house pay stub over

275
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,740
you know a few months of time hopefully
uh...

276
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,489
and i hope that

277
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:51,870
the wild crosses at least firebird you
know six als dat

278
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,350
uh... across a skis

279
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,350
so what are the steps to actually
developing software and releasing it

280
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,050
well

281
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,920
right the software sinus offer our
curvature pgp key to identify yourself

282
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,410
as the author and stated

283
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,579
establish that reputation tattoos were
stories written by you and you phyllis

284
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,210
risk risk it it doesn't gain hears it
doesn't game viruses or other problems i

285
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,290
had to push republic ease that people
can verify the signatures

286
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,589
and many districts offer received
anonymous network of people actually get

287
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,110
ricki lake at your software

288
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,080
and they have everything they need
actually run the program uh...

289
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,370
yet publisher method of contacting you
one of the biggest on one point i think

290
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,910
a lot of people have with this kind of
method

291
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,510
uh... or expulsion sovereign option
without actually signing it and and

292
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,220
identifying themselves as

293
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,890
well how do you give bug reports back
idea patches back how u communication

294
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:43,140
from users about uh...

295
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,480
new features that like to see

296
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,990
there are ways to have people

297
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,640
post information in public forms in
cricket so you can read it

298
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,079
step one right to suffer that's always
who are parked

299
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,780
uh... unseemly

300
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,839
not to do that

301
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,440
uh... science up archive is very easy as
well

302
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,680
sperry simple command which you can t
provides protection on the server if

303
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,480
your surrogate act so mechanical inside
your software archive and answer viruses

304
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,060
into the actual stores koto

305
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,460
you know blisters or strode

306
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,900
its protection in transit

307
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:19,140
so much going through approx or
something like that

308
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:22,230
you can easily do binary replacement
software package that the downloading

309
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,790
because it will have a valid signature
or whatever the replacing a software

310
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,670
with

311
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,490
and it provides protection for the cost
around and they're they have the

312
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,940
reputation back in the actual validity
of the software and

313
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,950
if their own computer gets hacked they
have assigned erica

314
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,850
pusher public econ there's many

315
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,670
many december networks out there how
much d as i see one of the best

316
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,690
established in oldest uh...

317
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:47,910
iran's on the deputy sa four subsidies
that madison i want to run something

318
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,089
chaos uh...

319
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,510
it uh...

320
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,080
is probably the most people use right
now and then there's one at our local

321
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,800
kwik net that's out there i'd like to
compare one because it's very

322
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,880
graphically from click through the world
of cross pretty easily miss got some

323
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,170
other tools to help you die i went to a
trust

324
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,460
sternly a bad idea poster public key
single website allotted all principals

325
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,570
from keys on their own web sites and

326
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,760
yet that website would be hacked anneke
replaced uh... it's not as easy to term

327
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,069
in that if you guys have key server

328
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,960
thing is a major problem wilkie
replacement had refused to shooting your

329
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,720
your public key to say

330
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,759
yelper the finger

331
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:27,910
you know world well but page

332
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,969
you can't make it a lot of pierre pierre
network

333
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,500
uh... and make them

334
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,380
passionate pgp file or whatever
available so buchanan search for the key

335
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,860
uh... posted in a newsgroup things like
that

336
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,590
again i really think the key servers are
the best place so because they provide

337
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,680
additional tools to help your value
which will trust

338
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,560
now to distribute your software

339
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,260
uh...

340
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,270
obviously he saw collect war

341
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,510
uh...

342
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,630
which prevents people from knowing where
this version the software is

343
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,580
how you can use toward first inhabit no
propagated not to amir network

344
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,329
major distribution sites like
sourceforge as long as you

345
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,260
access and or some other mail

346
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,350
your method of an out of my asking
yourself

347
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,000
uh...

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,470
you can email it appears that you wanted
to know them and i was you miller can he

349
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,360
well usenik anyways

350
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,030
it's not that hard to get it out there

351
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,680
and if one of these numbers for a
failure to have an owner realty a

352
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,640
push a method of contacting with you app

353
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,949
also not a mess

354
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,880
you're using a pgp key

355
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,939
apology

356
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,630
as a method of allowing users to verify
your software archive

357
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,800
we can also use a public each receiving
cookie content

358
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,890
so someone has a overboard on a sentient

359
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,479
they can critical report

360
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:40,280
uh... with the

361
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,860
public kiki cube

362
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,199
distributed to launder of us overcrowded

363
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,929
imposing carpets are for text in a news
tip like a lt anonymous budget bill to

364
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:48,860
pick up that

365
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,199
without really revealing the easing off
an ominous

366
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,370
to all

367
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,540
to receive our reports

368
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,960
you having been creeping up there on the
ues net instead of just plain taxed

369
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,530
prevent someone from the century
watching the access of that content

370
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:05,810
because no one knows what it is
acceptable fleet you know you

371
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,029
you can use not repeat

372
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:10,140
uh... you can at the my did a
communications with you in different

373
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,690
formats you may be one of the binary
archive i'm mailing lists

374
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,730
uh... you all binary or something like
that

375
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,579
avoid giving out any kind of personal
email address no hotmail gmail anything

376
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,280
like that even if you're not accessing
attendant on a musician uh...

377
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,069
system like an open proxy uh... it still
just a bad idea

378
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,850
uh... email this with no subscribers are
kind of cool a way to do it

379
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,350
archive dot org i think it's got uh...

380
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,100
uh... system we can automatically settle
uh...

381
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,080
you know archives about any kind of
listerine like that you can read it to

382
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,139
the web ill

383
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,470
and avoid uh...

384
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,980
some the complexities of actually
accessing uh...

385
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,460
use nephew modern

386
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,670
providers

387
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,300
new releases are made the same way

388
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,530
uh... can save these this method for
many years without any kind of problems

389
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,330
i think

390
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,320
uh... alternative methods are available
for system goes down or shuts down

391
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,000
and uh...

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,409
in a worst-case scenario if you do you
find that you're unable to walk

393
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:10,990
she's in a unanimous method on the
internet which you can do is uh...

394
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,300
what people have been for many years and
that's just old you can at least a lot

395
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,168
of the original

396
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,399
cartography source code they kind of
surface in the seventies and eighties

397
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:21,750
uh... came out this way basically mailed
in a

398
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,230
ipaper emblem today from people who are
known to be

399
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,540
point to post on the internet masai for
punks a lot of stuff kinda stuck out of

400
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,700
different companies that way

401
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,300
soho public projects we work in this
model

402
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,480
what would it look like well

403
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,850
eager to suffer

404
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,999
and the public key they verified to use
it they find a problem

405
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:46,320
uh... image the redaction crit did and
posted secretary to the public was top

406
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,480
recruits it processes the patch and
uh...

407
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,980
makes a new release possibly with it

408
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,600
or even issues assigned you know
security advisory a lot of people are

409
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,430
talking there guys trisha and they're
not sending this offer archives and i

410
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,390
think that's

411
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,640
that said i mean it's something that
would really benefit everyone i think

412
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,970
it's an easy thing to do

413
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,380
a lot of people who write software do it
because it helps them get jobs it helps

414
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,650
and not build a reputation they need to
get hired

415
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,559
to get bench capital to start company or
something like that

416
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,040
obviously uh...

417
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,889
you know there is a lot written about
this player

418
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,169
about the college eagleton camera that i
say might be worthwhile uh...

419
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,620
you can prove your identity was your
knowledge groups or just by god

420
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,720
disclosing secrets

421
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,910
that's made uh...

422
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,630
with the keeping that you have to the
project

423
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,230
for example um...

424
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,669
if you want to prove to a potential
employer that to pursue a software

425
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:43,540
how you can see the the potential blurry
encrypt a secret

426
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,659
with the public key of the project now
the software

427
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,500
and uh... provided the certification and
a cricket improved it you know it tds is

428
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,630
or not true for you can just tell me off

429
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,279
fraser something like that

430
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,919
what's really interesting about

431
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,989
the whole model of digital signatures
and i think a lot of people realizes

432
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:03,580
shift

433
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,620
is that you can make a richer statements
about our trip content hull basically

434
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,750
what you do when you make a digital
signatures you make a hash

435
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,170
stream of uh...

436
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,890
a binary information

437
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,260
and you produce a

438
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,110
tightly compressed certain size

439
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:19,289
value from it

440
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,980
doesn't matter what they value isn't it

441
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,260
pgp signature is basically just

442
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,490
a hash

443
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,020
that's interested with your secret key
people can be crippled you publicly and

444
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,379
then verify by performing the hash
themselves

445
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,880
perhaps representation of anything to be
digitally signed and signatures he

446
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,549
certainly didn't attach forms

447
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:41,410
it may be another software over maybe
your security auditor

448
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,120
you can go and take a project

449
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,210
bike patchy your or any project

450
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,159
and uh...

451
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,810
audit the code

452
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,460
make some kind of statement by the cold
like i've found no possibility of an ask

453
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,320
you all exploiting this p_h_p_
programmer

454
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,679
i found a possibility of a buffer
overflow in this version of attaching

455
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,030
and you can produce that

456
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:02,720
uh... statement and sign it and post it
to you

457
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,750
i mean less like bunker something like
that

458
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,970
and caught the number of the security
ons to build a reputation for yourself

459
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,390
without actually disclosing identity now
that may be something that

460
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,970
a lot of people might have to do as
uh...

461
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,890
laws like the d_m_z_

462
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:20,260
bosnian servers engineering and exploit
circulation become uh...

463
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:26,570
more green tested and

464
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,700
so how would you four per project that
was developed in this model uh...

465
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,630
this is easy to shattering to keep their

466
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,119
uh... sing trying to keep here

467
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,869
lends credibility if you get it signed
by the previous projects key pair or one

468
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,260
developer snip regent

469
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,670
previous project

470
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,210
how would this mob account for my sd
i'll bomb

471
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,990
depicting is they want to compromise
your identity

472
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:52,150
yo santori about the possibility of of
having you keep your world expiry

473
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,370
developer compromised uh... make sure
the keys awal entry into a trust

474
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,050
and devoted to porky param revocation is
important soldiers certain packets that

475
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,090
beach becuase it you can add uh...

476
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,689
essentially identifier relocation see
that's a good idea i'd definitely go to

477
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,460
keep his compromise because the blessing
you wanted someone to actually

478
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,559
and take over your project in your
identity

479
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,950
uh... on the internet therein

480
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,809
police tape ashes are new versions that
are actually malicious

481
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:18,520
uh...

482
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,289
wanting to be aware of the listed

483
00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,320
position to keep your for the project
would definitely be proof of involvement

484
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,689
so if you're doing something you don't
want to want to know uh... you might be

485
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,900
a good idea to destroy the key pair
after you welcome kuda the project

486
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,910
what's involved in an britain to keep
your uh...

487
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,500
will normally what would happen is
usually a search right

488
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,309
the government will come and you know
the warrant or

489
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:43,910
the popular copolymer to get a warrant
and they would come in actually that

490
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,669
your computer

491
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:48,499
or or your flash memory chip rewritten
floppy disk or whatever held your secret

492
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,510
keeper on it

493
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,870
uh... they don't perform a password
guessing attack against a group

494
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,610
shinseito people actually

495
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,860
got a courtesy kooky prove this

496
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,220
do you think he was part of the keeper
that was involved in the software

497
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,250
development

498
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:04,130
and then you send proof of possession
keepers proof to kinda lafayette

499
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,630
again i think they're mcm factor large
numbers very quickly and easily this is

500
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,480
a big o notation of of actually how long
it takes we think uh... some winter

501
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,270
to the federal large number with uh...

502
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,060
the general membership setting and if
you look at how the gentleman repealed

503
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,909
sudhi works

504
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:23,830
the bills i see you then um...

505
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,490
what it does is it

506
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,570
generates com

507
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,409
tka polynomial to preserve resolvable
are composite number and a priest to

508
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,279
groups of

509
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,810
to bring groups uh...

510
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:39,240
the dhl rings in aruba laying a certain
way hustler which basically do is

511
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,299
calculate uh...

512
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,100
candidate primes uh...

513
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,160
the the results with me uh...

514
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,100
polynomial and you search for smoothness
and all the smooth candidates on become

515
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,299
part one of the ring structures

516
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:57,350
that ring structure then you do you take
those candidates may find this once and

517
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,720
you do it basically differences course
factoring i want to see if you know

518
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:05,560
yeah the road rendering on an actual
composite about

519
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,020
multiplication effort

520
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,139
if you find that one of the composite
numbers in that

521
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,610
you know the you know our prime the
large the differing uh...

522
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,980
backers in a certain way then you get

523
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,310
actually the private key um...

524
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:24,379
we haven't seen any real advances and in
general number field setting the last

525
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,960
few years

526
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,570
music registered name murphy uh... that
i believe he was in uh...

527
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,980
in kentucky who wrote uh... paper and it
said it

528
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,030
possibility for organizing number
factoring uh...

529
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:38,970
of of large summer prime numbers is

530
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,330
polynomial selection step of the the
dome over fields are

531
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,600
uh... back in the nineteen seventy's or
people experimenting with multiple rings

532
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:51,940
you know more than moon just to uh...
and multiple polynomials soap

533
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,720
yen essays employing most of the
mathematicians in the world right now

534
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,430
involve the best once and you know what
it guess is that they made a drink they

535
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,100
re and in factoring and in the general
over phyllis even you know one of our

536
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,190
options are there opera singer best
publishing a comical uh...

537
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,510
and some of the other uh... optical

538
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,500
factoring mechanisms uh...

539
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,940
you know publicly announced that they
actually

540
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,850
did have a function quantum computer
that was working at its muhammad tickets

541
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:21,900
do they have now

542
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,809
i really don't think that you should be
should trust this completely

543
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:29,750
there are other ways you can drive
protector identities person who work in

544
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,900
a group uh...

545
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:34,770
ring signatures are big think um...

546
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:36,010
relating in any

547
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,379
electrical ever protocols

548
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,480
from the decadent field from the
journals for the last no ten or fifteen

549
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,309
years the deal with secretly thing and
how to best leak secrets is is really a

550
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:47,629
good thing to look at antenna think
about

551
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,620
group signatures are obviously more war
sellers should seize shipments were

552
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,000
scrutiny should implement them

553
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,030
but i'll

554
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:58,420
you can unmask the actual sing door in a
in a repair group of uh... signature

555
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,080
but

556
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,129
withering signatures um...

557
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,700
you can't unmask were actually out of
the group has actually signed uh...

558
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,650
say asaf archive in our case

559
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,220
uh... it's a lot more harder to identify
him

560
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,650
if necessary you can use in the ring
signatures in in that format roger

561
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,639
working with the group

562
00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:18,669
uh... in terms of value structure pgp
keys that's really a personal decision

563
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,320
do you have one pgp key that's that's a
personal key that use a sign your

564
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,010
archives and sign your announcements and
so forth

565
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,690
or do you create a project pgp key uh...

566
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,779
and disease developer have their own
kier do you actually to share the from

567
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,060
secret in the public key uh...

568
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,419
you know they're all different ways you
can kind of structure the project in

569
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,540
terms of what you are planner how
difficult it is to be concerned about

570
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,220
i've written a couple documents ico step
by step on how to do the stuff uh... if

571
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,460
you're interested in it

572
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:51,010
uh... summer clears old out but i didn't
go back and kinda kind update them

573
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:54,210
but they're basically sound the
basically there how if anybody has any

574
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,799
any questions about how to do any of it

575
00:26:55,799 --> 00:26:57,389
or anything like that

576
00:26:57,390 --> 00:27:00,330
i'm really city in contact with nam
putting out some software that automate

577
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,090
slow the process is for you

578
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,659
i was going to go a little bit deeper
into some of the math on that but i'd

579
00:27:07,659 --> 00:27:10,580
decided against it so one a little over
my last talk

580
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,240
but uh... if anybody wants it explains
like within deftly and actually too you

581
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,530
know why poor work out of it and stuff
like that you let me know and kinda

582
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,639
happy to explain it to you

583
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,640
so any questions at all

584
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,970
what's to prevent the uh... say and
uh... post organizations around the

585
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:35,970
world from doing time every trade off
with the prime number of factors

586
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,060
according to the

587
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,260
really anything i think that

588
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,100
uh... like i said you have to kind of
person that you're you're going to be

589
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,150
factored

590
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,310
eventually if if you're you're trying to
work with one you know against one of

591
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,320
those groups

592
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,918
the thing that i think is is

593
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,370
mos aboard about the n_s_a_ is that

594
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:58,840
where they've really made all them tech
love as is the last few years uh... is

595
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,020
the ability i sleep cycle streams of
communication as well as cracking out

596
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,249
who's talking to who

597
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,299
so when you get a string that small you
have such a good idea of what people are

598
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,059
saying include talking to you in

599
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:10,520
you know all about their life and you
know everything that our written many

600
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,500
views you got to deal with a weed

601
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,850
and you can kind of put together a
vocabulary that they would use in udall

602
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,779
the most important things in our lives
you can wait those nine

603
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:22,219
you see that dictionary attack i mean
every pgp key that's fallen and i know

604
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:23,700
of

605
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,900
visit has been through dictionary attack
with with one exception and that was our

606
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,640
scarborough and chicago mobster that
fuse q liking these biscuit on harvard

607
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,559
hit him

608
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:36,460
and that was the f_b_i_ and i think
that's why it was kilo yeah i think that

609
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,630
they're not going to just go ahead and
break your pgp key if your trading music

610
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,890
obviously saw it

611
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,770
i don't think it's a huge concern is
kinda like how do you keep a lot of

612
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:46,908
profile uh...

613
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:49,460
you know how important is memory and
stuff it's it's really hard to say in

614
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,429
this important don't know if it's early
but i think that that's

615
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,340
that so many years old now that such in
old model uh...

616
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,450
there's definite better ways to factor
out there

617
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,010
and i also wanted to coming on one thing
you give us a lot of requirements for

618
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,908
the tsunami

619
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:09,860
uh... style and uh... feel that the
invisible spectacle now

620
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,560
uh... fills a lot of that with the
ability to have completely anonymous

621
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,280
websites where you could just one your
bugzilla and and not have to worry about

622
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,590
posting to all time mountains

623
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,260
and also the ability to

624
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,750
if you have a changed it so that people
can go on free no

625
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:32,030
and go to county or project and it will
get sent over to the itu p_r_c_

626
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,100
server where on houston use your card
total

627
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,070
onion routed encrypt it an anot

628
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,889
unanimity

629
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,620
yeah the x one point others who like as
it is wonderful projects methods other

630
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,680
uh... onion routing uh... database in
the same kind of stuff answers invisible

631
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,980
ir c project we accept meetings uh...

632
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,110
certain seaport networks with a new
round of into and and so

633
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:58,030
there's a lot of ways to do it i wrote a
lot of stuff a few years ago so it is

634
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,360
all technology old stuff but

635
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,269
it's only getting easier so that we take
a look at it

636
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:06,549
uh... speaking of which were technology
nine united routing does that sound like

637
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:08,809
a lot of latency injector

638
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:09,830
uh...

639
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,220
them for technology and onion routing i
mean

640
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:18,470
uh... jitters point is very sensitive to
the latency jitter

641
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,710
does not seem like about combination i
mean first carry sure but for having a

642
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,299
for conversation day would be would be
doable but uh...

643
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,000
taking quality services improving
tremendously

644
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,379
uh... reversed argosy you know broader
specifically go forward with a lot

645
00:30:32,379 --> 00:30:33,690
bigger uh...

646
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:37,930
directors in taxes this look like a and
and more memories of so

647
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:40,470
you know how could you deploy

648
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,490
claudia servicer appear to cornet work
will no one's really done it yet but it

649
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:46,129
certainly some he could do i mean this
offers out there and it's

650
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:49,700
nolasco includes a lot of the quality of
service restored so

651
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,010
you would be a problem and it would be
doable but i think that it's something

652
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,750
the sec lethal

653
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,940
ochiga backslide so i can catch those
urals

654
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,410
uh... my question is actually uh... what
happens when social engineering and

655
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,150
enter some of the stuff like here for
the keys becomes compromise uh...

656
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,560
lacquered someone mentioned that keys
stay around for awhile and if it's

657
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,570
compromise it's a real pain

658
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,669
rasco how like i was active handles or
how would you know it's it's it's like a

659
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:19,630
deadly afternoon the real world rights a
real pain in the past absolutely it's

660
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,000
it's very difficult uh... so what do you
do

661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,190
what do you have to get the training
users you know deficit would agree to

662
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,180
give them you know they they checked the
website in their own they get their

663
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,690
email address for you can send in the
new and and so forth ur

664
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,300
you know there's some way to communicate
with you users via bug tracker something

665
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,059
else

666
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,250
let's say that you and i told him suffer
project together and and

667
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,670
uh... my tickets compromised

668
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,359
hopefully when i generally mikey
especially relocation

669
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,910
no let's say that what happened is ah...

670
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:49,620
yet the eye can arrested me because i
yeah

671
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,450
by uh... which is being you jules new
album

672
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,500
uh... on the internet

673
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,820
uh... there a by house you know the
beating update you with the mag lights

674
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:02,059
in the head and three times until i get
my password

675
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:04,168
maybe some water for sure you know who
knows

676
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:05,650
uh...

677
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:07,230
they have my secret key

678
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:08,029
uh...

679
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:11,220
they watch it on my paper network as its
super awesome as quality service

680
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,720
built-in done your honor

681
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,320
uh...

682
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,070
so

683
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:19,370
babysitter you know they make up a
suffer academy put it out there and it's

684
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,560
basically just you know our measure

685
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,110
no slash

686
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:28,270
garnished are ethnic slash interest
please every spouse and every hates me

687
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:34,039
and i walked on the street and people
sourceone some stuff

688
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:36,908
if i specified in your kitchen can show
that what you little chris

689
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:39,039
uh... you have the passage that
relocation ki

690
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,560
you can generate was call the relocation
certificate which is basically

691
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,980
this weird pista detach signature just
like the signatures on a source code

692
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:51,620
but it has a special back in the marcia
location it has the key i_d_ and then

693
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,580
there's also the ability to give a
different reason for the relocation seat

694
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,250
i don't know yet f_b_i_ can go and get
beat up

695
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,169
uh... until we just

696
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:01,779
turned over in a way it was um...

697
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,760
in a new post at location should be out
of the users

698
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,230
you put it on the key server at the key
server marks the key is revoked uh...

699
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:11,940
curtain at the when i wrote as big red
letters and you know h one heading

700
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,750
no disputed revoked

701
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,120
people see the new key

702
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,260
if the import of your patience to get
into their junior p_g_ tearing into the

703
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,670
key to be supper keyrings high water for
the singer they'll say you know that

704
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,590
signatures no-good uh...

705
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,750
so hopefully you get that location sir
to get out to users you still have a

706
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,370
balaji for the project

707
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:32,840
uh... hopefully i get out of jail at
some point and generally keep myself and

708
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,040
start working on a project again

709
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,610
and that's basically how it's dealt with
in terms of social engineering if

710
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:41,380
someone you know managed debt

711
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,330
warn the people in on the project to do
something there really shouldn't cause a

712
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:47,760
lot harder no one really recommend is
forking the project that point starting

713
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,500
a new trust will project i could take
out whoever did a bad stuff

714
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,929
uh... couple questions uh...

715
00:33:55,929 --> 00:33:57,350
verses

716
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,060
i was actually walking last week setting
up a key server and whether things that

717
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,460
i found conspicuously lacking is that

718
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,949
uh... p_k_ s seems to be kind of aging
and know when

719
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:13,609
seems to be made there's academically

720
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:14,389
uh...

721
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,949
keys uh... well-lit

722
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,370
profit sourceforge search for snow

723
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,368
update since two thousand four

724
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,779
uh...

725
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:24,708
like what are some good

726
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:27,158
alternatives for out of the box

727
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,350
kick ass as i mean the code actually
since connect revealed just be t_v_

728
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,259
database than you know

729
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:33,050
research

730
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:39,199
posts are so sportbbc cultures for that

731
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:45,089
you know jerry's interest as far as you
know cleaning up the coder

732
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:49,409
letter that was asking her question is
offering it to the west annika

733
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:53,159
yet u_p_s_ alger magazine at m_i_t_ mark
or what's a long time ago he sees his

734
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,030
and i don't have a second i sat in any
suffered a moment

735
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,210
um... this offer is very old as laudable
janet long-standing a one is substance

736
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,550
you know they use to clobber cities
himachal some peas in a single kiya look

737
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:07,030
across and down time sometimes keys
would fall into other identities and

738
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,340
stuff like that us that's what some
things that that is is actually a pork

739
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,170
of the peak yesco that's had some fixes
so there is larger guys out there that

740
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:19,930
are actively patching uh... gas and they
have a mailing list and if he sent me

741
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,190
emails sent to a point to a but i can't
remember dr dot med uh... thank you

742
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,000
in terms of my key server um...

743
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,530
i try to switch over from of working
model t_ p thread tonight fucked up the

744
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,890
current terribly bad

745
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,288
and i admit it was south all the
deadlock ng and uh...

746
00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:38,069
know all the different you know

747
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,038
churn issues between a thread so i'm i'm
working on it although i have a new

748
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,499
version out scenic coming up which in
the back burner when i realized how bad

749
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:47,619
i messed it up

750
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:50,669
you know one other thing is pgp
corporation has a official key server

751
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:53,779
now because the keys were networks or
work in that while because because we

752
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,310
get old lotus mechanic

753
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,730
so you can write it for me

754
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:01,470
begins items are in the meantime uh...
pgp corp keyser and use that and

755
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,590
hopefully you know some things that
adults there only because i don't know

756
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:09,700
how to pursue my stuff off at some point
uh... meets to another question cheer

757
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,140
obviously one of the main super mom s

758
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,189
and um...

759
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:17,009
i'd i maybe

760
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:21,459
explorer or some capitan miser

761
00:36:21,459 --> 00:36:22,680
if you're not using

762
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,080
he's matters

763
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,970
you know email and uh... any isshi kiki
transaction

764
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,019
your recording

765
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,109
axes

766
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:31,989
and uh...

767
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,309
trying to like

768
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:36,179
bootstrap and identity of the very
decade

769
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:37,469
c bean

770
00:36:37,469 --> 00:36:38,949
very difficult to

771
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:43,140
maintain that your particular i_p_ firm

783
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,879
real questions so it's a kickass we'd be
on

784
00:37:18,879 --> 00:37:20,859
the weather trust four

785
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,299
heidi pgi

786
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:24,829
and your scenario where

787
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:28,099
your

788
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:29,400
code that is

789
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,799
of questionable lee legality

790
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:35,029
contributing to

791
00:37:35,029 --> 00:37:36,809
establish project

792
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,459
uh... where

793
00:37:38,459 --> 00:37:41,098
people have relied entities

794
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,829
and they're signing your key

795
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:47,079
in the case of a search warrant what's
preventing

796
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,359
them from getting their doors broken
down and revealing your identity i mean

797
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,019
that

798
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:57,229
when you had that was that the apache by
things looked let's say you know

799
00:37:57,229 --> 00:38:01,369
using a speedy p you know doing some
type of security plugin for apache

800
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:05,959
other patchy developers youth met them
in need space

801
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,469
decide your key

802
00:38:07,469 --> 00:38:11,299
that it's it's just the list at that
point nota very good very aquent

803
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:13,149
requestion

804
00:38:13,149 --> 00:38:17,649
if you actually located open because
then you're darcy reporting uh... and

805
00:38:17,649 --> 00:38:19,850
look at the signature types you can do

806
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,038
there's a whole number of mm identify
mechanics vessels and

807
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,849
there's no statements are set to meet a
person in person

808
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:31,609
for example if i am model programs like
resource code and no set wide miss a he

809
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,078
actually wrote that drew berkline i mean
i want to use it nine downloaded i read

810
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,769
through the source code i said well
unisys could search for the non-singing

811
00:38:37,769 --> 00:38:41,069
bag going on here hears it to keep his
sinus

812
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,479
you know this looks like a fish
approaching on a good sign eki you know

813
00:38:44,479 --> 00:38:48,359
and i never met him i don't know but
i've trusted becky is associate with a

814
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:49,889
project so

815
00:38:49,889 --> 00:38:52,799
i think he basically covered her
statements about archery content and

816
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:56,999
well that arbitrage they may just be
that addresses key is you know the king

817
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,859
charge of the project and that is all
you really trying to determine when you

818
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:04,598
look to a trust for personal mosquitoes
from from not arguing with that entire

819
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:08,149
on the industry i think i know you know
if i was just bring up the fact that you

820
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,990
if you're contributing to a

821
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,859
major project in total what's it like
debian there

822
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:14,630

823
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,940
meet their weapons trust steroids and
uh... you know

824
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,210
if we really want stuff to get out to
their you know private packaging major

825
