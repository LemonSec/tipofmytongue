our intellectual property in like the
title but thats was

42
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,200
was called arm but outside the class I
was invited to a conference

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,959
in now University home and they told me

44
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,550
do you like and you'll feel it comes
about downloading and sharing is good

45
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,720
and I said well sounds good the title
skin

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,810
arm if it's the way I think I can back
up

47
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,900
with data so sure enough there you got
proof

48
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,799
and later on you'll see why proof is
needed prove that I wasn't

49
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,569
a lecturer there in the University are
top rated one

50
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,159
are improving that I was invited to give
a speech

51
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:29,870
proof that the the room was reserved for
an ass beach

52
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:33,829
arm and then this little facts right
there

53
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,849
thing his own one week before

54
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,900
more less I was to give that lecture arm

55
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,280
the span is arm music players
association basically

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,409
when the media rampage saying
downloading from p2p networks this

57
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:51,798
against the law in Spain which is not I
mean our laws in different

58
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,189
we have helped by the copy provision you
don't but basically it is not his load

59
00:03:56,189 --> 00:03:56,720
the morning

60
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,689
anything from has been at work since
Penn are and that's been upheld in court

61
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:04,849
many times saw I you said you know there
they're trying to confuse the people

62
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:06,099
they're trying to confuse the media

63
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,209
I i think is lighter is a perfect chance
to prove they're wrong and they're

64
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:10,879
misleading

65
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,110
so I send arm certify faxes

66
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:17,420
are and notices to the National Police
arm

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,590
high-tech all brigade and to the
National Association of music producers

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:26,630
telling them that I was going to give a
lecture on that and I i washed

69
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,950
going to download during that lecture
and if they thought it was legal the

70
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,270
could this common arrest me if they want
to well

71
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,840
what happened next it's his are bizarre

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,690
arm what happened this is that they try
to censure

73
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,780
my lecture and they way they did it

74
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,350
and and have proven they are and who
they did it and in how they did it

75
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,400
its really amazing I went in the room in
the room

76
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,330
at the scheduled time and the security
guard said no arm you can't you can give

77
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,479
lecture here because

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,760
home basically we've been told that this
is

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,280
under maintenance or clothes for any
other reason just kept you the lecture

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,760
went to another one into the building
that was supposed to be free

81
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,020
another son as we were walking tall
weighs their

82
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:16,109
the security guard himself you know what
there was something there was a lecture

83
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,110
schedule there nobody knows about that

84
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,460
but you can't give a lecture there so I
went to my classroom

85
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,049
tried to give a lecture I knew there
wasn't anybody there because I

86
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,440
park there um and the the security guard
or send arm

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,880
I was told not to let you in well

88
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,509
even to ask me what's going on what's
the matter and they say well known quote

89
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:38,720
me on this I will not

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,180
acknowledge this but the call came
directly from the Dean

91
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,949
and he's been pressured not to lead to
give this lecture and I said well

92
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:50,110
millicent shut my mouth I mean that's
good or bad I know but to cash in my

93
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,819
mouth

94
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,880
so I went to the cafeteria I

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,810
doubted they could close on the
cafeteria you know the most important

96
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,060
part

97
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,569
University saw as you can see in the
picture

98
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,580
I get a lecture %ah there and noms

99
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,599
successfully on turning 50 people some
money coming in

100
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,240
arm and nothing happened because
everything I said it was a bite

101
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,319
above the law ball research among the
dow I downloaded its legal

102
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,370
nothing happened obviously okay so after
the lecture

103
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,460
I was called into the office of the of
the master's degree program I was

104
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,199
teaching in

105
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,419
I was tall it's either you resign or

106
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,008
everybody in this apartment fire I'm a
good nice position

107
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,259
are who said that he said the Dean and I
say will matter with an exact I

108
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:39,289
I would mentor with his legal adviser
with someone and say well

109
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,050
no look from intro I've never look for
trouble okay so

110
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,130
when it is resigning and try to collect
as much proof as possible

111
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,860
of what's going on and when I found
really left me

112
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,380
are speechless the music I'll

113
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,469
producer Association of America MPAA

114
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,819
call that the my university ID from the
state's

115
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:03,919
to Spanier to say don't let this guy
speak

116
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,479
about what the law says I was in there

117
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:12,240
20 house people to to start over
revolution to overthrow the government

118
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,169
her shoot Britney Spears you know I was
in there do any of that

119
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,198
I was this going to teach them about the
law

120
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,800
well this guy's and their Spanish
counterparts acknowledge

121
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,289
doing that are and the USACE extortion

122
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:31,219
again people then knew about the phone
calls tell me what you know what they

123
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,560
said they said he then went to speak

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,580
bill Sen here investigators to
investigate

125
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,120
b2b donen and the university but while
it's legal so why

126
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,150
okay with them then tax inspectors

127
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,370
Sohar licenses specter's security safety
inspectors

128
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,199
health inspector and anytime inspector
you can ever imagine

129
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,180
I will catch you for something you can
be sure

130
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,520
so the team basically said his fans and

131
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,330
and David saw I was forced to

132
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,900
to quit and what happened next

133
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,110
0 well have a Nexus the world fine now
phone out

134
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,509
it was everywhere Japan Australia in
landing was all over the media

135
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,240
and so who cares I I really hate to be
in the picture

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,349
but what's important is this in this
graph you see the

137
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,530
three concepts which you can see because
its kono

138
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,629
but basically blew you see arm my name

139
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,729
and yellow you see the term censorship
in Spanish

140
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,110
Ventura and ring the city university and
now that's

141
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,340
the number of times been mentioning
blocks

142
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,169
now the pic together some people
associate my name

143
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,189
with the university with ownership
that's exactly the kind of our publicity

144
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,270
University once right so I was really
good for them

145
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:55,060
there was a smart move all obviously to
give in

146
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,640
but then you when I'm the one on and
some really strange things

147
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,560
are like on the media I could read

148
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,290
things like the guy in the Gulf fire was
really never

149
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:11,180
I lecturer in the University okay how
can I get fired if I wasn't like through

150
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,130
their

151
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,300
arm I'm in five years they didn't pay me
for basically not doing

152
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,520
anything I'll and all this tunes that I
talk

153
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,420
I mean it's ridiculous that's why I said
the proof was needed

154
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,420
then they start of threatening the
University threatening

155
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,420
all the media sayin if you talk to this
guy

156
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,709
we will not lead you in our university
we will not send your press releases a

157
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,089
new

158
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,390
during the blacklist if they talk to me
not

159
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:41,480
if they bias for me organs there are
some not give a talk to me

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,529
I mean they did not want the story to be
told

161
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:47,649
all the pressure went on I receive
threats

162
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:52,339
are my company received to tax
inspections in real

163
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,779
even though for several years has never
received one

164
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,899
are I personally receive to tax
inspectors general even

165
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,370
no embassy 14 arm I'll

166
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,769
so for inspection even though we only
use almost only use

167
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,380
of resolve or I mean it was ridiculous
obviously someone was

168
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,550
out are to pressure to get me arm
eventually found

169
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,980
are a dark spot on my resume which is
our

170
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,350
degree that I got from some American
University the American the summer can

171
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,829
use it went down

172
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:27,329
are the degree was not call legal neuro
borough how everyone

173
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:30,390
compatible or when everyone say anyways

174
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,199
I've I've got degrees from seven
universities met on this one

175
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,720
this not meet the requirements and then
all the media said this guy's boulders

176
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,310
these guys lie in disguise

177
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,850
no one listen to him or getting don't
listen to me

178
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,029
just look at the screen K the LysM I can

179
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:49,560
pushing their minds so what's this all
about

180
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,079
what am i speaking about that makes her
body so nervous

181
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,540
basically the concept of intellectual
property

182
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,529
that's when I won't talk about not
specifics of the law now what the

183
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,439
situation is with the concept

184
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,060
home whoever has the information has a
power you already know that

185
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,560
all it's a cliche about you can think of
the me to do to moms and Moses in the

186
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,880
medieval charging

187
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,959
if you don't know what all this is about
ass Munich order because when I have

188
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,690
time to go into specifics like this is
really interesting

189
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,980
home history of copyright basically
proves

190
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,350
that is a law that was enacted to all

191
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,420
force monopoly an to promote censorship

192
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,479
so that's where copyright started and ap
until two day

193
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,339
it is exactly that way and we'll have
plenty of time for debate

194
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:39,459
arm but what I want to do consider

195
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:42,579
is doesn't matter what the law says

196
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:45,970
what really matters is is if it's fair
where she reflects

197
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,779
your values for your needs her whenever
you know but don't

198
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,050
don't be blinded by own law says that so
I must've been

199
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,510
right okay tell germans during nasa
times

200
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,689
or tale some Americans %um bush times

201
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,630
are even if the law says that doesn't
mean that you have to obey

202
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,439
would you gotta think of as this affair
is that right

203
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,079
first time somebody asks now was on
planet Earth in our

204
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,550
two degrees for 100 how years before
Christ

205
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,920
how pedophilia was legal and socially
accepted back then

206
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,219
home well he asked in the senate I is
that right

207
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,639
I mean its okay well having him

208
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,990
I'm starting to understand cast out
there matches

209
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,260
Senate all companions

210
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,370
so bad but it's still even if you risk
being stab

211
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:39,269
I want you to consider what is the
concept not what the law says

212
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,610
so what s intellectual property why am I
saying it is wrong

213
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,889
why am I even saint invest na Texas we
are regulating something that is

214
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:50,639
does not exist imagine regulating blue

215
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,389
ella fan's that flies or even ring later
in

216
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,800
their air traffic

217
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,220
and everybody say no or yes you violated
are air-traffic

218
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,329
blow a fun called and you must go to
jail and people accepting that

219
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:09,320
is ridiculous so what is intellectual
property in one makes me think

220
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,260
that does not make any sense
intellectual

221
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,769
and property intellectual not as common
as it should be

222
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:21,130
but it still if the identifiable armpit
comes from intellect

223
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,750
right and it's gonna be communicated
simple enough I don't have to be

224
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,800
new which would be patten's it just has
to be

225
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,680
regional I have to fix it has to be
communicated that cannot regulate were

226
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,279
you thinking what's on your mind

227
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,269
you tryin the trying really hard summit
will get there but still today that can

228
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:38,089
do that

229
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,480
home but property thats the key

230
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,079
what's property now economist define
property

231
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:49,730
in a very interesting way and you know
that economies define reality is that is

232
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,649
so for something to be define its
property or to be property is gonna have

233
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,380
to cook for 6

234
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,779
one's gonna have antagonism which means
if I have it didn't

235
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:02,899
you know said your glasses attend your
classes run away with them

236
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,670
you don't have your glasses simple
concept

237
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,930
am it's gotta be excludable which means

238
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,079
if i lock my house you can going I mean

239
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,139
file secure my network you can go in
right

240
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:20,290
home but the idea behind this is not
about locks is about defining

241
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,040
edges the boundaries okay if you can
lock it if you can

242
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,689
grabbing and go away with it and and nap
let me touch it

243
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:30,810
it's because is definable easily now
that's the

244
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,620
air fit and accessory

245
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,680
what's my here you know vertical her
some you know we

246
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,360
within the same here that makes some
people nervous home

247
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,529
that's what air is that property I mean
he was tested in court

248
00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:49,149
years ago and the dot said it's not
proper okay

249
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:52,800
i've seen air being sold in bottles i've
seen

250
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,180
people stiff enough to buy em haha

251
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,230
II was one of them I wanted to buy one
and bring it here

252
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:02,459
by how do you have any cash at the
moment they weren't taking Creek Rd

253
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:06,829
arm but basically thats turning
something that is not

254
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:10,430
you know X a little when you put in a
bottle then it is exploitable

255
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,389
I mean you craig something that is now
property I'm to turn into property

256
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:18,209
nasa what the industry the cover in this
reading for

257
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,790
two hundred years basically they can the
products they put it in the can

258
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,029
City VIN L you know they put in in the
camp as long as you can touch it

259
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,070
and define it then he becomes property
but what happens when that is now

260
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,250
the case home is it time for a change

261
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,360
is a time for us to think that
something's changed I mean

262
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,170
allow yourselves to to change the menu
your hackers conference I mean you

263
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,279
should be used to change and if not

264
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,620
check your network home but

265
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,050
throughout history we've seen things
change things like

266
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,449
slavery now so many years ago

267
00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:57,850
1865 in this country he was not only
legal

268
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,750
but the bases of the economy of how the
country

269
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,139
was slavery and the slave owners where
proud

270
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:08,839
are members of the community and
everybody thought I was happy

271
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:13,199
wanna and then something changed is the
store is not as rosy as the

272
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,910
one think are but basically something
changed and now we think

273
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,839
slavery hope whoever right my point

274
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,240
at some point in history I hope they
will say

275
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,079
in fact a property hochu we ever and
I'll I'll show you how our house her

276
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:28,820
white

277
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,889
home what makes me think this time to
change

278
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,019
because has been aid paradigm tent our
digital station

279
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:39,850
you can make exact copies so antagonism
goes away

280
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,480
if I copy exact copy UPDF your people

281
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,490
you have the book I have the book the
exact same people

282
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,949
you can run away with it I can I can
stay here with it and

283
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:54,149
nothing happens now that doesn't happen
with the real book if you take my

284
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,920
blocking always at the nine

285
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,639
left without the book so there's a
chance there there's another big change

286
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,430
arm freedom office of expression for
many years that did not exist

287
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,089
for many years we thought the Texas that
some the wind really exist

288
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,579
arm but you cannot exclude intellectual
property

289
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,970
ideas creations are from people is like

290
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,910
is if I if I said okay I'm changing my
mind you know this conference should be

291
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,870
on the copyright

292
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,089
I won the Copa rainforest so everybody
had

293
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,240
you leaving you let me before you leave
all pool

294
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,840
a string out of your your and give meet
back what I said

295
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,620
I'm joking you can go um

296
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,670
if he was really property they could do
it I mean if the runway with my laptop

297
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:39,740
bags hey wat

298
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:43,500
give it back to me but it can give back
what I just said

299
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
with it is heard and hopefully listen to

300
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,510
all the CAC so it is not

301
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,100
all excludable so if his if antagonism
doesn't exist

302
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,550
and if it's not excludable then it is
now property

303
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,360
clear enough ok then we have the very
low cost of all reproduction

304
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,560
distribution everything any

305
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,669
things have changed basically things

idea and we can exchange ideas

invested

337
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:03,050
F-four it was a creation thing to do you
give it to someone

338
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,419
should be protected and should you be
paid for

339
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,010
and that makes you think you know how
this martian many think and

340
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:16,060
and then you got to pass you got dark
side

341
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,440
and you and the other side are whichever
path you choose

342
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,730
it will be very important for future but
for those of you who choose the dark

343
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:24,430
path

344
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,700
you may leave now arm the dark path will
be like

345
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,290
you're right i soo charge for everything
I some keep everything locked

346
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:35,120
I should be putting cover and everything
I said and everything I'd

347
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,290
the other idea is well his right how

348
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,950
did we ever think that copyrights right
how do we ever think

349
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,980
just because I'm invest in time just
because I'm missing money

350
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,350
just because you know you got two
options

351
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:52,730
home my point

352
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:56,500
is until now

353
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:00,910
the matter if you was copyrighted credit
Commons couple F whenever you want you

354
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,590
wanted to say everything was on one side
really

355
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:09,300
because there was no alternative this is
my proposition selfless

356
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,650
now self necessary Khan said that some
Spanish

357
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,350
saw have you 3d all talk about years ago

358
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:20,180
he was referring to another II rearm
that person's

359
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:24,380
but I apply it to kristens okay when you
say

360
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,520
my neighbor my song my brother

361
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,889
all on my father whenever

362
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,920
are you implant are you saying that they
are yours

363
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,320
physically horse property of you

364
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,950
belonging to you I'm he was a case you
could buy

365
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,360
chop them up in pieces and sell them by
the dollar

366
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,360
of my mother we know you know Wrentham
you can do anything because it was

367
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,710
it was ok to use your property obviously
not I mean some people

368
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,400
think that's the case when they announce
are there are many knots many

369
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,920
or incisions um obviously not Sol

370
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,280
if the are not your property but you
call them

371
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,149
my you don't like my son then wanted

372
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,470
civilly said they are selfless they half

373
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,160
self miss they are of themselves they're
not yours

374
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,240
is a trick of the language and we've
come accustomed with that is mines mines

375
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:18,830
when

376
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,639
just like rations up they want you to
believe that whatever you think

377
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,450
whatever you write whenever you create
is yours

378
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:30,030
is exactly the same as your son now to
have a son

379
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,160
journeyed to invest and knows if your
parents

380
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,230
already know what I'm talking about
invest money

381
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,290
lot of money every weekend this invest
time

382
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,770
I'll okay creating the Sun maybe the the
most fun part

383
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,680
but then you got a lifelong are time
investment that is not so much fun

384
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,770
invest a lot of air for lot of fr

385
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,530
you know but still is not yours

386
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,330
that's the key trying to apply the
concept to you intellectual creations

387
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,730
and see what happens

388
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,770
some love you you know me are major
league record label

389
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,610
are attorneys which I don't see any here
because the are required to wear a tie

390
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,420
um some of you are many things you know
that's not sick we applied a concept to

391
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,870
all this industry then everything will
go bonkers am prove you wrong

392
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,250
basically that's my all proposition

393
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,400
what where does that leave poss

394
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,060
work there you have what I call the
continuum the licenses continue you have

395
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,460
a one-sided censorship

396
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,880
and then just are moving to Warsaw
copyright

397
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,450
Creative Commons the GPL I'm sorry
mister stillman

398
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,950
you know I I think you are the boss you
are the man whatever but

399
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,210
public domain active there everything

400
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,340
is limited because licensors

401
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,970
are agreements our contract are

402
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,600
you have to ask for permission you are
granting permissive basically you're

403
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,840
begging

404
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,459
and 17 of freedom here now the only when

405
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,510
that I creation could be free is a no
license

406
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:12,770
no copyright no nothing just like my son

407
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:16,680
if you want to walk among whenever he's
old enough

408
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,790
if you was walking to the house fine

409
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,879
I'm sorry I'll cry I don't know he'll
walk into the house

410
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,160
are if you work for someone will I think
or they're taking advantage of my

411
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,030
creation I should get a cop

412
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,770
well that's acceptable we do with music
and books and movies

413
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,590
so self miss would mean no copyright no
license

414
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,689
no begging no asking no nothing you know

415
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,700
and we'll see what happens. mittens in
the market do you have a

416
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,330
ex-president for prison in the united
states have things exactly the way

417
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:54,149
I think now I'm not so crazy or you
elect crazy people for pressing which

418
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:57,490
might be the case and on the current
situation

419
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:02,770
I'm like I said I have to compress this
so this is the one part I'm skipping

420
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,120
now I assume you already know the
copyright stocks and if you don't

421
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,200
this recall this case is there so many
examples I mean

422
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,820
anybody here mean I'm not gonna anyone
see you can raise your hand if you want

423
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,990
I'm anybody's here to steal things the
cover is cool

424
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,490
I mean or doesn't see any problem with
copyright alright

425
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,940
is what just want to prolong this for
her huh

426
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,400
arm okay I could give you some examples

427
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,350
that how that we could be going on for
hours in fact

428
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,010
I'll be available there in the corner
for us owners want to be with me

429
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,210
tibet just one example you fight right
to charge

430
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,790
kids in summer camps for singing music

431
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:46,159
singin' they are singing music and the
app they have to pay

432
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,800
because they're singing music on for the
concept to American Society of Composers

433
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,260
now first

434
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,950
if any right I'm you fight right that im
in film and

435
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,480
taxi drivers gonna pay to the in the
society of music producers

436
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,580
because the half the radio in the taxi I
mean

437
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,699
anybody knows that we get in a taxi to
listen to the radio

438
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,740
know that they always got the best
stations you know

439
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,320
now they only paid like $20 dollars a
year which is not bad

440
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,659
and that's because they are driving with
the windows up

441
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,720
because is calling him arm if they
didn't roll the windows down he will be

442
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,880
public

443
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,960
diffusion I mean public Commissioner
music and if I have to pay more

444
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,190
arm if you think the copyright is right
we

445
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,080
we can go have dinner and talk for hours
basically

446
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,419
everybody else seems to agree with me so

447
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,480
let's look for solutions I hate people
who say this is wrong this is wrong this

448
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,320
is wrong

449
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,899
let's have a beer this is wrong this is
wrong the strong now what do we do

450
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:49,100
arm first let me talk about the wrong
solutions many people

451
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,230
propose in things like in Spain we pay a
royalty

452
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,360
for every blank media fold for every
four copies

453
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,590
scanner printer blank City blank DVD

454
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,220
CAS said Ted you can normally from for
the things we pay for and we pay for

455
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:09,130
arm in excess of was at five hundred
million dollars a year

456
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:13,450
I'm this money should be going to the
authors but thirty percent automatically

457
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,340
deducted

458
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,870
and he goes into somebody's pocket and
we know who despite are

459
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:22,710
I have enough legal problems already
home

460
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,110
then are more so that money is not
accounted for

461
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,430
and the government is not asking for any
accountability something

462
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,730
this method is just asking for
corruption I mean

463
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,820
do you guys have enough corruption
senior governments in

464
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,060
and don't try to expertise into Africa
you know so

465
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,840
I think any solution that it's making it
easy for corrupt people take a minute I

466
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,420
was not the right solution

467
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,450
arm legal prosecution for mayor

468
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,000
procession of technology the may allow
you

469
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,090
to override the RM now and nephew we do
not know what the RMS

470
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,530
anti copy okay you know what it is good
are in Spain

471
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,030
if you how anything Knology they will
allow you to override the RM

472
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:09,560
you're basically breaking the law
criminal law two years in jail

473
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,940
what is ways technology that allows you
to override the RM

474
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,180
like narrow morning application

475
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:23,180
eunice allied the shift key

476
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,890
now I know our precedent of our country
who owns said

477
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,090
the laptop in the house a shift key

478
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,850
Hui I mean when it's impeachment no

479
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:38,800
on okay anyways this is ridiculous this
is not the way obviously

480
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,690
then you have more strict people say not
quite now seventy years eighty years

481
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,660
many as 100 years more copyright

482
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,900
more people in jail more lawsuits do
know what nasty Canasta

483
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,240
backwards in time that's exactly what
they want they want to go back wasn't

484
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,060
that you can't do that you can do many
things were not going backwards in time

485
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,750
so arm this debate and you can see 1841
this has been going on for

486
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,990
for centuries arm and is non-stop

487
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,940
any all boils down to the of her
compensation

488
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,460
how do authors make Mon har har du how
could

489
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,600
offers me money or how should authors
make money

490
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,260
now there are several ways to make money
you know legally

491
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,970
I'll one not money a cabin same money by

492
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,480
I should have set compensation because
number one phone what I call voluntary

493
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,090
work

494
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,340
I mean some of you will volunteer out
Red Cross or whatever I'm fYI the

495
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,240
the home is whenever now you probably
will not get paid for that but you feel

496
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,040
happy

497
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,430
you do it and you the war do not get
paid and you're happy

498
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:43,470
and it works so that would be one method
thats

499
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,670
the traditional method in art ninety
percent of artists I'm making his number

500
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:47,970
Rob

501
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,270
more or less play music ride compose
create

502
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,389
and do not expect to be paid ever so
that's okay

503
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,010
begin their their I'm not saying that
should be four authors and for all

504
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,230
creation Smith

505
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,590
but thats we gotta keep that in mind
okay it's possible

506
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,850
and Spain they are trying to push in on
assess

507
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:11,450
no creation can be free

508
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,010
think about it okay so if this cannot be
free

509
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,530
what do I get the money from all will
finally up a new tax

510
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,320
I so many will tell you arm you should
be entitled ten dollars min W one lucky

511
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,720
nine and you know so home

512
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,680
option number two work for hire most of
us work for hire

513
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,560
war get paid by the hour by the we buy
them on but whatever bye object this way

514
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,639
whenever and thats

515
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,640
perfectly fine and in Spain is not

516
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,340
as useful as here here is quite useful
but thats option number two and

517
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,620
everybody should be happy with this

518
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,970
helped compose a song I'm feel like it I
give you a thousand dollars okay I feel

519
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:48,790
like it

520
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:52,230
of you not find out are I don't feel
like it because been on the wrong stones

521
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,770
you got a penny a hundred million
dollars to that okay here

522
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,860
okay fine no problem with that

523
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,130
now option number three speculation
that's what the current system is based

524
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:02,580
on

525
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,060
okay you compose a song I don't pay you
anything you wait

526
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,389
I created this physical objects for
downloadable music

527
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,780
with the RM of course and then I

528
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,210
we don't know how much they gonna be
solved but you get a cop

529
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:19,320
hi a small cut a tiny cock but you get
paid

530
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,409
and and will ride remorse and the media
will take pictures

531
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,950
you'll be happy okay fine to me that's
not so acceptable but still

532
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,960
X okay if you wanna get into that

533
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,300
you know that's possible member the
model and a six in the IP worldly

534
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,480
intellectual property well does not make
sense licensing

535
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,470
royalties you know that is crazy and we
can discuss everything

536
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,560
for time said would go on with cell
tentative

537
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,100
the Freak called I specifically said
free called

538
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,910
open source free software open call
whatever you want to call it

539
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,350
okay I'm more for free software rather
than open source but

540
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:03,510
but okay whenever the free code thing

541
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,750
home has been applied to somewhere two
books content to music

542
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,970
to Nasir products to research white can
add a reply to

543
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:16,270
everything else arm what without
internet if the copyright

544
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,379
okay said couple read it and it did not
exist

545
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,490
good all we'll talk about that later

546
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,560
home what would you do you want to be
missin you wanna be famous you gonna

547

I somebody knows gonna be ahead so what
are you doing you have

548
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,080
quote protection now let me tell you
something about protection

549
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,260
have seen the movie The Go some like
I'll two guys walk into a bar and this

550
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,410
is not a joke

551
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,480
two guys walk into a bar I'm going to
map bartender bar owner and said

552
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,050
you know what you need protection saw

553
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:51,129
give us 100 box and you get it

554
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,490
and the bar owner says one only
protection and I'm fine thank

555
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,450
home you will need protection so give us
on a box or

556
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,590
or the barbers down with regular Lex

557
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:05,060
thats protection that's the protection
of copyright

558
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,149
okay give us five thousand dollars and
we will not sue you for known in p2p

559
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,310
thats protection in my world is called
extortion

560
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,460
okay but as with the copyright law bass
so

561
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,840
what protection do you really need you
unit market protection

562
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,350
who has market protection finger food
your company

563
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:27,130
who protect your company the market no
one you

564
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,960
your speed durability your quality your
product your pricing

565
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,400
your contacts your advertising I don't
know how

566
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,040
but you got a secret and that once keep
your business running

567
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,790
so in the in the copyright were all
industry intellectual property

568
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,230
what can you do to beat everyone else to
the market

569
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,520
and be protected in the market well be
first to market

570
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,639
obviously if you create something you're
gonna be first no matter how fast a copy

571
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,260
you

572
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,550
you the first and you've seen these
people that way

573
00:33:56,550 --> 00:34:01,610
are and days in line to see are Lord of
the Rings and and on

574
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm I know people like that arm this
people are going to see the premier

575
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,770
you're not going to see tomorrow or
somebody copied it from the screen and

576
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,440
then the combining the street not

577
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,409
they want they want it first they wanna
pay and no way there and I'm

578
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,000
there is a market for being first and
obviously the offer it is going to be

579
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,409
first

580
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,070
remnick recognition I mean if you become
the Rolling Stones June anyone

581
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,540
junior record labels Union lawyers you
need anything you are the Rolling Stones

582
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,619
arm how do you get Brenda commissions

583
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:36,379
exposure distribution for this revision
p2p networks

584
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:40,598
arm know how if you are the author
nobody knows more mature

585
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,730
works for you innovation you create so
you innovate

586
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,760
are service work for hire we talked
about that before

587
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:52,750
so the key point last point market the
author

588
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,770
not be work you shoot cell

589
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,070
the offer no his time his autograph

590
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,400
his interviews is whatever that's my
position

591
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,980
anyways that lead us to hacking business

592
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,109
I'm a Hakka heart mom

593
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:13,630
and not so much harm also every day but
home

594
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,170
when applying hack into business hacked
to pieces

595
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,460
how to hack businesses home well

596
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,750
school when I had to stop being a
lecturer

597
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:28,560
I have to become something arm so I
became a businessman

598
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,000
how do you that I don't know I mean it's
not a businessman in teaching

599
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,570
college so I to the hacker approach

600
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:38,590
with that approach while did the
research

601
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,830
then discover vulnerabilities market
niches you know

602
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,049
holes you develop the exploits which
means

603
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,120
you create the product home

604
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:52,460
and make money now what you gonna do is
with the money you prove your point

605
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,690
am then you give the money back to the
community 40 percent

606
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,230
that's what it's called the anarchist
banker my objective is to make a lot of

607
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,940
money

608
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,610
to give the money back to hack laps
hacked meanings

609
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,200
arm poor authors and other stuff like
that to prove that point

610
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,800
that the system works if you happen

611
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,040
so I create a few businesses free
software

612
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,960
free music coming up soon free science
research

613
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,080
and free publications I read magazine
the magazine you combine the new stance

614
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,049
still you can read my blog in my blog
for free and the penny

615
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,190
and for free and they pay me the works

616
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,490
so that's the key I'm anyways

617
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,730
this is how I imagine a future believe
this for later because i won

618
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,460
America to talk about what can we do
activism

619
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,770
so this is all things we can do gather
information sharing

620
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,910
debate act an acronym created City Cross
and Blue Cross and Sarah Sarah

621
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:53,430
and at the end if nothing works you the
wall still unfair

622
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:59,240
if everything Sox if people are going to
jail for things they should not

623
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,180
my car them straight rices disobeyed 5

I didn't say that can cannery one ok

626
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:14,510
nevermind overthrown or evolution as a
manner

627
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:21,510
hard to do something so here's an
example of what we're doing to spend

788
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,230
the people cocaine and now

789
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,820
home we are a few minutes for questions
how and here

790
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:41,400
before we start with the questions on
two things would be out there as long as

791
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,310
you guys want so we can keep this a big
point as long as you want

792
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:48,920
your YouTube our website's are the ones
as horny curtail up minutes me

793
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,870
the other one is is no over a snark a
time to come

794
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,299
you know our emails and on my website on
my blog actually on the on the

795
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,370
column in the right first link it says

796
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,480
gonna leave it on differ with freedom
you've got

797
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,610
did not pitch collects links to

798
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,450
sites to download music for free legally
are within the republican me

799
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:15,330
Creative Commons ur or whatever you over
one million songs along with their

800
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:19,900
sorry if you ever buy the CD against
because you have way too much spare time

801
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,910
so now home questions to me when
everyone

802
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:30,910
working

803
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:35,790
now om you

804
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:39,490
when I've argued for large group of
people

805
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:43,970
that intellectual property is
illegitimate and then

806
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:47,810
taken a debate had counter-arguments I
found that they

807
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:52,549
on this all boils down to the issue the
so-called free rider problem

808
00:48:52,550 --> 00:48:56,990
that well why should I create anything
if then somebody says gonna copy it

809
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:02,840
where's that there's no incentive

810
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,120
I guess how is you

811
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:10,410
successfully communicated the free rider
problem is

812
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,589
not a problem that people

813
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,380
invest in what makes sense without being
guaranteed

814
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,050
or entitled to particular profit or
return

815
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,700
this now arm give them examples that's
what works

816
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,920
tell mark or doctoral my way are great
guy

817
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,930
great offer great writer arm his book
some

818
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:36,109
for free downloadable from the net and
he makes a lotta money while

819
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:39,870
he makes money there is living on a home
on time anonymous a lot but probably not

820
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,220
selling them the best sellers science
fiction so

821
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:46,400
the problem is a business model now the
law

822
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,710
I mean I Riley I put my articles

823
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,680
for free on the web site and they get
paid for putting not gonna magazine

824
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,669
which has a copyright

825
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,160
never free my website so I mean the
promise not to log I mean you don't need

826
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,250
a blog to say this or not done in a new

827
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,660
a business model that except some
tentative and then I'm

828
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:09,009
a twist to what you've said as many
offers are conditioned to his mind this

829
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,510
man's man if someone takes away and
makes money

830
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,610
that were buxom I mean fine posted
everywhere before Fri

831
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,210
the memory when a I mean they are doing
US

832
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:23,570
service a favor they're promoting your
job something you have not done

833
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:28,010
I'm if you want to publish that I make
money doing you have not let them do it

834
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,780
so I mean the promise not to love the
promise showing them examples that you

835
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,020
can be done and it's being done in the
works

836
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:39,220
sour ASCII to for that can you

837
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,080
give us some examples that are
necessarily

838
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:46,380
about novelty I think people tend to
write off

839
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,090
boxer are free music as oh well

840
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:54,510
you know they're buying it because a
they like the idea of having a copy of

841
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,270
it or something but if it came down to

842
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:01,100
something important like drugs or
business software something that that

843
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,190
wouldn't necessarily

844
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,850
be the cases that are there solid
example Zafar

845
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,640
I've got I'm not over 120 example
someone in mind previous nature's a

846
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:10,609
five-hour ones

847
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,000
so I do you'll find a my website and I a
continual is meant if you're interested

848
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,490
I can you feel it second posted

849
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,450
again if you want okay thanks thinks
first off thank you very much speech

850
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,160
radio and

851
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,730
intellectual property fire well I
completely agree with them in their bank

852
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,210
gonna clear the concise

853
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:32,080
their great but there are a couple
points that don't fully understand about

854
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,759
your view

855
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,760
first of is you said that the GPL

856
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,110
is limitation %uh if you think but I
seen seen at the GPL actually

857
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,370
lets you keep your freedom keep that
software

858
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:47,430
source open and free how do you

859
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,480
think that it's actually on because I
don't okay this is

860
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,380
this is my point for civil %ah

861
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:58,520
I really like stoma are related to be a
I really like the open source and free

862
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,880
software movement aka

863
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:04,940
hurry love them but they're working
within the system

864
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:08,190
and that's the difference I want to
destroy the system

865
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:13,460
up don't we all saw

866
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,470
and the reason i'm saying that is
because the

867
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:20,710
in the system a new system a better
system I'm a more direct system would

868
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,160
work without me

869
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,049
this is the right now in place so that's
a different the pillsbury those working

870
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,420
within the system needs the copyright to
work

871
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:35,420
so when is the copyright laws to go down
enough

872
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,300
said well the point is: they

873
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,310
San out two offers in the magazine a
contract saying you can sign it

874
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,570
and all the words will be cooperate and
you're giving us this close-up Andersson

875
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:51,980
hed

876
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,980
you can pick me and I will not sign this
message is fine with us

877
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,760
so the thing is I cannot change the
whole magazine

878
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,320
I can prove with my example I can
publish a new magazine back in nineteen

879
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,110
makes the policy my articles

880
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:07,630
is the most widely distributed car
computer makers in the country

881
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:12,130
so I'll i think is worth it to be there
even if it's with their copyright

882
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:16,600
but as long as you can get my text my
article for free from my side

883
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,640
so I mean one thing is to in theory in
philosophy

884
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,710
tried to bring on the system I'm you
think is doing it

885
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:28,940
really physically it takes steps feat a
city PL it takes Creative Commons

886
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,030
so it takes working in a covering the
magazine

887
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,290
and do you need all steps but here i'm
talking philosophy

888
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:38,430
philosophy 3 this jump ahead you know
soaring

889
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,740
you some question yeah that it leads
right into my second question is are

890
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:43,740
already is based

891
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,740
society revolved not with capitalism

892
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,940
something else I mean if it if so
doesn't that take to strengthen security

893
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,020
is cuz how was posted

894
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,610
tell people copyright shit if we're
saying get rid of the entire system

895
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,890
cap enormous and again we've been times
for some capitals

896
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,000
although we can argue that for arm I'm
sayin

897
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,170
get rediscovery loss I make money

898
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:09,430
time same I'm making money out of my

899
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:12,970
creations for free on the side I'm
making money enough

900
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,480
free summer people that I hire created

901
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,990
we put a out for free and then some
people pay us

902
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,900
so you know I'm not saying ago against
capitalism we can talk about that but

903
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:24,770
we're talking about

904
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,320
copyright on the same period copyright
miss not the same

905
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,140
is like freeze over is reason for him
not some yes

906
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,509
and I'm I've been told to stop saw all
UN

907
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:39,330
line are we can talk in the corner okay
but since you were talking and

908
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:43,040
doing finish I well do you have time

909
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,880
I'm I've been told to stop I'm sorry so
I'll be out there and thank you guys

910
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,070

911

the room
