1
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:30,560
coming up next on

2
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,630
exploring your world with open source

3
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,780
GIS GPS and Google Maps on directly
after this panel will have social

4
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,650
engineering

5
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,830
she definitely wanna check that out and
not jello a city to merchandise in the

6
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,739
home also

7
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:49,440
you're looking for some oven Jello
Biafra stuff it some

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,580
out there for sale but the where he
forgot your name so to go back in here

9
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,180
mike in polymers 94 and 102

10
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,860
good afternoon everyone

11
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,230
my name is my kinsmen from phone we're
gonna talk a little bit about

12
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:13,370
explore your world with the some cool
mapping tools

13
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:18,520
on JS is geographical information
systems and GPS which probably oh noes

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:18,880
cool

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,610
positioning systems don't talk about
that and posing talk about Google Maps

16
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,270
on for reggin begin apologize that this
is a bit over

17
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,380
America centric takoma most the maps
will be the United States up the sort of

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,089
us really a

19
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,990
but a can anyone I don't have a guess
here wit

20
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,480
this map in the upper left-hand corner
might be of

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,480
this kinda middle mountain US here no

22
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:53,390
for thinks is where the heck's live I
that this from a fence or not true

23
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,270
it's actually a corn production which
yeah set a record

24
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,390
so 100 how did I get it all started with
this

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,410
um is OK modem excuse me

26
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:09,989
environmental justice movement that
surge in Chicago where

27
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,030
a few people from took 12 soil samples
around the

28
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,280
number one let polluter which is a brass
Motor Inn

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,840
Cook County at the county were chicago
is and

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,980
we had this map for me see these red
dots here

31
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,230
our midst the so simply took and some
wonder this hand nice hand-drawn map but

32
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:35,060
we want to come to tell a story like how
much lead is in this neighborhood and

33
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,560
will carry

34
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,720
maps can we digitize to 10 it so the
story so

35
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,350
I don't really know anything about
mapping but I've always been soon maps

36
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,880
unwanted

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,049
to begin making them arm

38
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,410
so Paul use this program is open source
program from University Minnesota called

39
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,180
MapServer

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,380
and he may be some a nice maps but

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,450
you can see here these little yellow
dots represent the places we took the

42
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,690
arm soil samples and they'll settle
number on limiting

43
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,140
indicates the pollution but you

44
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,110
um it didn't quite tell the story I
wanted to right next to the left thereof

45
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,590
the

46
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,140
the Big Red factory there is ninety six
times the legal limit

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,300
lead allowed arm and just by looking at
this and look at the numbers Uddin

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,010
didn't quite tell the story that we want
to tell so

49
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,799
asserted out last summer at a couple
weeks on my hands up in the summer and

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,209
I started learning our grass GIS and I
made some

51
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,950
pretty crude looking maps here which is
basically the same thing the Sun last

52
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,760
slide but

53
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,329
what it is I interpolated on thus

54
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,690
the concentrations have led into that
red box they're worried

55
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,530
where we had our highest sample and also
on some other contours the CR

56
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,610
those are the legal limit so anything
outside those contours is

57
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,610
you know in unsafe level for children to
be playing around

58
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:00,130
on so in a stocky

59
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,390
from contorted gonna give an overview

60
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:06,959
work Mon I'm are gonna be doing arm I
may be talking to scan the sum insured

61
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,709
amount is what is JS

62
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,140
now why would you want to use open
source GIS some

63
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,860
based couple basic geography concept
Sarmina projections

64
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,169
things that you need to know to get
started the two different datatypes

65
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:23,090
and other than the actual software
application posing we talking about

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,910
geocoding a demographic data some
geocoding services and %uh some

67
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,830
a demo Google Maps and including some
information about that security of your

68
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,550
information when using Google Maps

69
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,500
so yaar

70
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,300
why would you want to use open-source JS
jess is kind of this

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,600
arcane field somewhat that Tom business

72
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,320
one piece this offer made by as recall
our few that's been around forever it's

73
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,270
really expensive

74
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,000
and its most people think that's the
only way that you can you can make maps

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,870
like this

76
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,440
arm but what are the best attributes
about using an open source GIS like this

77
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,139
is that

78
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,370
you're not locked down to any particular
data format

79
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,550
this quote from a book explica book I
recommend are one the best features of

80
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,889
the open source tools is their ability
to work

81
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,949
with data created by proprietary
applications in store to protect

82
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,560
proprietary formats

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,270
there's a lot of good data out there
that's not in this proprietary formats

84
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,198
but there also is what a good data that
is in its proprietary formats so

85
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,620
by using open source yes you're not
locked down anyone in these formats and

86
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,639
you can easily work

87
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,440
in between them on couple reasons
provinces JS

88
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,580
um if you don't want to buyer still

89
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,340
was suffered cost fifteen hundred
dollars and I'm

90
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,760
gonna the the Microsoft the GS world and
despite suffocation being so expensive

91
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,110
it some slow and buggy and it's it's a
big legacy application and it doesn't

92
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,340
function like a

93
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,070
in a release a software for someone like
me are I primarily work in Lenexa do

94
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,740
most lyden office work from I know it's
10

95
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,340
arm and I don't have windows and all
these applications run on Windows

96
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,990
and you know sometimes you don't wanna
for mapping so you just wanna put a few

97
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,410
few points on a map in its una certa
gone by this this full application

98
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:17,540
so a quick background on this basically
two types of data in GaAs to make maps

99
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,590
army a vector data in raster data into

100
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:24,660
it was common formats a vector data as
you shapefile switchers specter

101
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,080
specter line files and Tiger lines as
census data that's freely available

102
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,150
so well at the most basic did tape is a
point

103
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:35,639
an example that is like a city centre
arm

104
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,490
run lines Lake roads and highways new

105
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,440
boundaries here you see that the pink
urban areas

106
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,880
and the centroid which is in in area and
has a central point such as a

107
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,050
shaper and I went to

108
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,050
this is an example love using several
different types of vector data

109
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,490
the late color background AC roan
Minnesota Iowa and the Center for the US

110
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,030
there is actually the data

111
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,520
same day that he is to make that
three-dimensional map in the beginning

112
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,219
arm and the little blue and green lines
are no plants which I'd

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,220
on downloaded on fair HTML table and
then converted in CSB and then use

114
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,680
geocoding which powers gonna talk about
to get locations the Pirates

115
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,759
your kind of data is raster data and

116
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:26,340
I love you actually work with raster
data it's its format so you know like

117
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,759
Tiffin Jay pag

118
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,000
and basically what it is is our it's
just an image file you can look at it in

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,530
a regular is your

120
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:36,259
but each pixel represents an X&Y so

121
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:39,389
you know each pixel in the image I'm
even though you know on the screen it's

122
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:39,979
very tiny

123
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,300
you could say it represents maybe 530
degrees in the extraction and 600

124
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,310
sorry 500 meters in the extraction and
600 meters in the y-direction

125
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,009
and the color part of it represents the
data value

126
00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,220
and each dataset here on say that you
maybe have

127
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,289
all this data for example is a Minnesota
when power potential

128
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,009
C average windspeed from and that varies
in between like

129
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:07,110
five in 10 meters per second so you just
that

130
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,150
associate a color math with the raster
data

131
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,610
and the picture in the lower right hand
corner is just three dimensional version

132
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,560
of that

133
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,150
a couple basic geography terms they need
to know those two types accordance

134
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,860
geographic and project accordance
geographic ordinance like latitude

135
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,970
longitude

136
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,810
on all contain a model over the earth
which is usually an ellipsoid

137
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,029
which is just kinda like an oblong shape
for the earth arm

138
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:38,169
a datum which you some you that use GPS
O'Brien know what it is

139
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:42,000
arm wgs84 is what's going on is Angie

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,790
GPS applications and an 80 North
American datum 1983

141
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,620
is actually just an XY Center on the
earth where

142
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,800
are that the lips so it fits

143
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,600
and also you have your geographic cortin
system that the latitude/longitude

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,700
project accordance with we've all seen
different projections have maps you know

145
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,880
everyone's familiar with

146
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,899
you know nice looking like it's bigger
than the sizeof

147
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,459
South America arm and and that's because
that particular projection

148
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:15,700
isn't preserving area no each projection
when you look at a projection it's

149
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,040
can only preserve one thing area
distance direction or shape

150
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,449
or you can actually rejection up
reserves none of these but kinda

151
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,850
looks good in all of them NIS 100 the
difference for

152
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,339
different projections out there just
pick up an hour soon look in the lower

153
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,709
left hand corner to leave

154
00:09:31,709 --> 00:09:35,290
all these crazy differ productions so

155
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,949
why should you even care about this if
you wanna make maps arm

156
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,510
because when you first start over the
biggest things that you're going to

157
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,209
stumble

158
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,350
across is if you look in that this left
n pitcher here

159
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,850
there's the black outline which is a
vector data vector shaper Minnesota

160
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,610
and then you go to imports on this
raster data and nothing matches up for

161
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,180
baby

162
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,060
you know you have a street street map in
Indy find a cool arm shapefile

163
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,160
bicycle routes in and you overlay though
many find that you know

164
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,569
the streets don't even matchup well
that's because

165
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,130
when you can love learning a sufrir you
learn this offer and you just say like

166
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,170
ok just

167
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,300
just import the state I don't care about
the rejections we actually do kinda need

168
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,790
to

169
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:18,819
to see yourself a little bit about
actions on

170
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,279
and on the right here we see arm missus
for MapQuest but you can actually see

171
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,360
one way to tell in any image if it's
projected or not

172
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,690
it's six using geographic ordinance
because if you look at the 49th parallel

173
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,740
that the

174
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,740
northern boundary the United States to
see oh it's a straight line

175
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,740
arm that's actually are most

176
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,660
map it servers like Yahoo map questing
Google Maps are actually projecting

177
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,120
their data they're just

178
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,490
there is dumping it out in the Rye
ex-wife format it saves a lot of

179
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,540
computing time

180
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,709
and if you know if you look at some
other northern states

181
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,029
there but they're a bit skewed

182
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:01,660
um quickest really love grass jessup
church usher in a second

183
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,240
it was developed by the Army Corps of
Engineers until the mid 90's switch them

184
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,810
in

185
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,420
the Army Corps decided that there was
other proprietary

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,370
suffer out there and they shouldn't be
developing your own GIS

187
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,580
are it's mainly used for raster data
types such as cool a comment about

188
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,720
the most is the natural resource type
things like you know they want to model

189
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,459
rivers and things like that

190
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,050
but it is a a full-featured GIS you can
pretty much do anything that you can do

191
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:30,100
it you know it's fifteen hundred dollars
software

192
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,230
in in the grass but I can say from
experience this last year learning a

193
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,930
im actually drive me crazy sometimes arm

194
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,420
there is a new yeah I said it has
registered a taste but there's been a

195
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,910
new vector engine rewritten

196
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,810
which is pretty good and also someone
recently redid the goo in its which

197
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,959
more like the proprietary software which

198
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,330
thinkin bout but it's it's a pretty good
for right now so this is a a picture the

199
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,430
a screenshot to the latest grass it's a
beta version that's been around which

200
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,430
will be stable in a couple months but

201
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,470
in see it it's a tickle TK gooey

202
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,580
arm said on top of all this command
lines what are the best features about

203
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,870
having it basically run always command
line tools is

204
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,209
you can build a map like this you see
here and then just

205
00:12:16,209 --> 00:12:19,690
put all the commands that use to make
the map in the fun in a file

206
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,760
in a script file when the next time you
wanna make a map like this you just run

207
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,649
the script

208
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:29,050
you amish admission to the Iran's on
Windows

209
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,980
1x and Western if you're a no one does
it need

210
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,810
sick when to do it oh you can make
professional-looking maps

211
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,959
in grants arm this is when I recently
made its

212
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,110
Minnesota 80 meter when speed and
transmission lines it's to try and

213
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,779
figure out where we should build
transmission lines in order to develop

214
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:49,140
when power

215
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,459
on it's actually a postscript arm

216
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,800
many language the rate these the the
they make these maps in

217
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,890
it's tedious but you can make
professional-looking maps and you can

218
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,519
also save this post script agree to any
printer and have

219
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,370
only a few huge maps made on and it also
allows you to make like

220
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,079
if you wanna develop your own little
special solar something you can just

221
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,649
make like a little postscript

222
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,500
file included in if you make little will
or something

223
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,430
on when the more fun things about
grasses that has really cool 3d

224
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,839
capabilities from this is a a map with
my honeymoon in alaska

225
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,720
actually from last summer arm the red
lines are

226
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,660
the roots were my wife and i buy
schooled and the limit this map was I

227
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,930
just took a

228
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,180
an outline of alaska and a highway image

229
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,310
and just digitized individual points

230
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,170
on my route and then the colorful model
that you see is the digital elevation

231
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,690
model

232
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,589
and but that's a raster image it comes
into a tiff images so we can look at

233
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:55,860
but use them for that and then um grass
as a really cool 3d viewer that you can

234
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,290
move around change leading and things
like that

235
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:02,500
know is just another example some 30
maps that are made in a

236
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,560
grass that's a the symmetry of the Xhosa
central Japan

237
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,130
I'm interested in this cuz trying to
figure out all the places a world very

238
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,450
good offshore wind turbines

239
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,540
um moving on to the GPS for the TOC

240
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,699
aren't you can wear the causation do a
GPS is

241
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,399
mark out irregularly shaped areas and
and put them on a

242
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,709
unique about that maybe no one else is
done on

243
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:31,040
this is useful if you know if you're
ever in exploring you are a shared

244
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,370
sure we've been doing with other people
on and this

245
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,730
thus the graphic he represents so couple
weekends ago

246
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,959
I was trying to rate the stock you know
try to develop arm

247
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,630
the GPS part of it and so I'm using
Kohistan

248
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,519
and Tom this open source of work I'll
GPS battle

249
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,620
which is a basically can read in any

250
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,660
arm GPS format an output to

251
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,760
many different formats like %uh CSV
files

252
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,260
or on GPX which is like the XML data

253
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,269
GPS for a so and it thus ended up taking
way more time they should have CNC ready

254
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,880
is there a script dangerous wearing

255
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,779
and allotted time to just make this this
outline which you see here

256
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,850
on thats those were my points um

257
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,209
if you really all you want to do with
from

258
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:26,610
your GPS is just make some street maps
and

259
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,950
just you make up a pretty looking maps
maybe maybe this route is now for you

260
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,850
but if if you actually 10 make you so
maps that you can

261
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,070
plot out in changing share with other
people

262
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,040
it is worth the time to learn how to do
it using is open source tools

263
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,149
so we see here on the center objects the
kinda purplish object

264
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,010
on his Prospect Park in Brooklyn and
what I did as I stroke my GPS

265
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:54,240
receiver to my helmet and bikes around
the park

266
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,459
and then brought it home in imported
into

267
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:01,959
grass using those tools I mention the
previous page

268
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:05,240
and down the background images call the

269
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,209
dear did digital raster graphic which is
available from the US Geological Survey

270
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:13,649
survey and overlaid the two maps and

271
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,500
you can see that I was able to take this
kind of irregular objects

272
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,040
on which 1 I've been so easy to you know
pick out on them out

273
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,959
and get some useful statistics of it and
and perfectly match up its location at

274
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:25,779
you see that our

275
00:16:25,779 --> 00:16:29,339
on the bottom where it says its 330
acres and I figured out the link to do

276
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,990
so

277
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,630
let's take this very useful thing you
can do on similar ideas that you can do

278
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,040
is

279
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,860
so he if you wanna map may be something
cool industrial rooms they found you can

280
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,959
take your GPS receiver and just walk
around the perimeter

281
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,519
the ruins and then reno in my mark out
on a map for these actually are

282
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,870
and you know GPS receivers um are maybe
with and

283
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,089
fifty feet or something you're obviously
not gonna get a perfect on your

284
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:59,079
you're doing with a large object like
this that thats different except where

285
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:02,139
own you know so in a crate hidden trails

286
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,730
they sure the people and also love us
know

287
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,970
we'll than that is a great resource that
people use GPS to map out

288
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:17,389
wifi on their the soco online tools that
you can use to visualize UPS

289
00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:20,389
data if you download arms

290
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:24,500
GPX files with that UPS powerful program
that I was talking about

291
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,519
you can just go to the GPS visualizer
die from

292
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,279
and upload your files and it's a really
cool track severe elevation change the

293
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:33,970
different colors represent I'll

294
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,190
the change in elevation is also free did
on the web

295
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,929
arm depending on what you're doing he
should probably never have to pay for

296
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:43,289
any of the stator

297
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:47,450
on need when you are looking for GIS
data you shouldn't just go to google and

298
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,549
type in

299
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:51,629
you know state boundary outline it will
take forever

300
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:54,859
he should definitely go to some these
geo data clearinghouses

301
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:59,289
National Atlas stud gov is an incredible
resource if you working at the

302
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:03,019
the US level on has all kinds a really
great

303
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:06,700
background files you're just basic
things like lakes rivers

304
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:10,289
grow so things like you know affect
agriculture census some

305
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:13,369
crime statistics office things like that
as re

306
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:16,699
from the evil Microsoft as um

307
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,450
as a lot over free data available on
their website the US Geological Survey

308
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,809
has

309
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,889
a seamless data download ringer their
website and discovered during a box out

310
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:29,119
the main download the data that you need
that I got that the

311
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,320
member Prospect Park tiger census data

312
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,399
though polls will talk about that but
also tear service kit for aerial photos

313
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:41,159
um if you're dealing at the state and
county city level

314
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,619
a lot of places have a GIS office where
they basically post

315
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:48,809
other base files from on the website

316
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,879
and a you know you can also roll your
own day like it should use that as a No

317
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:56,379
now that I made you can just find some
date on the net the maybe has a

318
00:18:56,379 --> 00:19:00,970
you know a city and state associated
with that and some something about like

319
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,909
the plot for a capacity

320
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:06,710
and just use your occurring which
bosnian talk about to

321
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,960
showed it show where the locations are I
was really get into this there's

322
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,820
a few books that almost things you
probably just scrape up the when

323
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,439
webbing get some good resources but
there's three good books that are up to

324
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,429
recommend

325
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:23,820
from mapping acts the middle book open
source GIS

326
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,879
um that's a really expensive a dollar
book

327
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:31,119
are actually only as the old version the
vector engine but

328
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:34,359
if you really get into to using graphs
we should

329
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,439
differing by the book it's worth it and
also web mapping which covers more

330
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,580
above map server which will talk about a
minute home

331
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,590
assert our map server is a a web-based
mapping program

332
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,049
that you can basically import anyone
have these

333
00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:54,629
from JS for all these years for what
their proprietary ones in

334
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:58,229
and its really good resource if you want
to display streets

335
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:02,970
and if you need to make a lotta labels
labeling in JS is a huge problem if you

336
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:03,979
just display

337
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:07,879
the you know all the street maps a
Manhattan industry dollar labels it'll

338
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:10,389
just be like a big black garbled mess
but

339
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:14,049
arm meltzer actually has a a really nice
interface

340
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:18,309
home for smartly putting labels amounts
making really nice boobs

341
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,789
um if you were to databases post JS is a

342
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,649
GS yes extension for PostgreSQL

343
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,659
from and that basically adds just you
know allowed to do laundry 22

344
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,989
any kind of attribute data that you
wanna put into the database

345
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:36,999
and if you need to set up liquor
distributed

346
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:41,509
web application for displaying maps arm
those chairs is good because

347
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:44,859
you can run queries are always since the
day they or display

348
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:49,199
GPS fellow mention and if you just wanna
kinda get exploring get into this

349
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,729
on QGIS is a a great resource that runs
on Mac clinics

350
00:20:53,729 --> 00:21:00,729
and windows and you can open up
shapefiles in this round

351
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:09,129
alright well I think we'll wrap it up
there impasse over DePaul

352
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,580
hello everyone

353
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:28,090
I'm Paul suitor Mike invited me to join
him today so that I could kinda

354
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,879
maybe fill out this %uh mapping
presentation a little bit with a

355
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,070
different perspective

356
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,169
um a lot of other work that Mike's done
a

357
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:41,820
are natural resource mapping project
some things having to do with pollution

358
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,850
things with very

359
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:46,580
a more fiske and the odd shapes in areas

360
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:49,780
um where's my background is a lot more
with with

361
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,090
analyzing like demographic data

362
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:58,350
doing social research om and doing stuff
more with with people and places

363
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,040
and addresses so I'm gonna talk about
two things

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,770
um the first big topic a really my main
big topic here

365
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:10,810
is i wanna talk about geocoding and I'm
also gonna talk just a little bit about

366
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,580
om Google Maps and some other commercial

367
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,120
a but but free um web-based services
that are available

368
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600
and on how those things can make your
life much easier but also

369
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,550
I'm gonna discuss some other the the
privacy and security implications of

370
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,320
using those

371
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,750
those things um

372
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,870
so first about geocoding what is
geocoding

373
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,040
geocoding is is just the simple process

374
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,050
I love taking an address and driving a
latitude longitude

375
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,790
cordon that point and then putting it on
a map um

376
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,220
this map right here II created with the
little tool that I whipped up by using

377
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,780
the new version of Google Maps

378
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:55,550
and on my dropped into it this listed
addresses

379
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,389
there's a love website called
fund-raising

380
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,580
.org on where you can get donors to
political parties

381
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:07,189
the address is over all the donors to a
particular political party I grab the

382
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,240
RNC donors for this neighborhood

383
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,470
and dropped in here so all these

384
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,710
these addresses listed here off to the
the left side

385
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:23,640
um I then %ah you can see each one
corresponds to a point on this man om

386
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:28,420
so when when I first got into the stuff
in the first to do in geocoding

387
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,520
you know it was amazing to me that you
can just type in address into a computer

388
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,960
and damn you get these points back the
tell you where it is

389
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,300
I thought wow that's going to be so
complicated you know what could make

390
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,050
that work

391
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,820
um and then I i really got into into
looking at this in learning a little

392
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,350
more

393
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,330
and in I realized it's actually very
simple %uh algorithm

394
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,510
that om geocoding issues to be able to
do this man check taking an address and

395
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,360
putting in an

396
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,730
coming out with the point on geocoding

397
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,520
generally consistent kinda two major
components there's the software

398
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,530
which except your input

399
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,110
either through a web API or a pearl API

400
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,760
whenever you pass it an address and then
the software does some stuff

401
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,690
and then it comes back to you with your
corner points and maybe some other

402
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,090
validation information about your
interests um other major component is

403
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,010
the dataset

404
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:24,110
from the dataset are

405
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,890
for doing geocoding is a it's a digital
representation

406
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:33,430
other street map where you have line
segments

407
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,540
in each line segment like this green one

408
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:40,180
on on this example on represents a

409
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,980
a part of the street I'm if you're out
in the country where roads are curvy in

410
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,590
line D

411
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,530
you might have a road represented by a
punch line segments that approximate

412
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,070
the curvy part om in a city like this
where there's a grid

413
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,600
its streets are straight is still have
you have a punch line segments

414
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,980
where on each intersection has a line
segment for each

415
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,390
each street that intersects om and

416
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:06,570
then all the stuff the stored in this
big data set file

417
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,860
each line is labeled with the street
name

418
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,050
as well as the city and state in zip
code

419
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:17,740
where that street exists um the other
information

420
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,210
it's in a dataset has to do with
endpoints a feature these line segments

421
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,330
on in this this is how you it's able to

422
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:28,760
to pinpoint an address is like for this
example

423
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,440
um 10 these endpoints is

424
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,980
407 deafening the other end point is
probably sounded something like four

425
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,990
hundred twenty seventh Avenue

426
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,320
now I G O coated in this example 401 7th
Avenue

427
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,500
so what it did is it takes each in
pointing to preach in point it has a

428
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,170
house number

429
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,750
and his latitude/longitude coordinates
so knowing the 400 is here

430
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,390
and 120 is here looking for 401

431
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,800
it interpolates between those two points
finds the

432
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,720
approximate distance that the house
number we're geocoding is

433
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,130
then take those latitude/longitude
coordinates and kinda finds that

434
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:12,240
approximate in between spot where the
address should be

435
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,500
and that's it that's how geocoding works

436
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,460
um there are a few limitations one

437
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,560
big one is that it doesn't know what
side of the street

438
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,409
and addresses on whenever you geocoding
address it's not going to come up with a

439
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,310
pinpoint

440
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,360
right in the middle love the roof of the
house it's going to come up with a

441
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,270
ten-point

442
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:36,250
on the yellow line in the middle of the
street in front of the house

443
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,360
com you also have some issues with this
interpolation algorithm

444
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,530
in places where there isn't even house
numbers

445
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:49,370
like them you know in most cities or
lattice lotta places and allow to cities

446
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,620
the houses are numbered kind evenly on

447
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,620
in a the interpolation works pretty well
but what if you have a block where

448
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,960
there's maybe a big building on

449
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,560
and in its address is like

450
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,530
you know for 19 and it takes up half the
block

451
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:10,129
and then in 400 and one through four
hundred and seventeen

452
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,320
are all squeezed into the other half a
block well

453
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,720
if you geo code the address one in
seventeen

454
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,870
seventh Avenue let's say that's the case
on this blog

455
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:24,490
om it may not hit the right spot because

456
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:28,740
it interpolations a linear thing but
addresses are now is distributed in a

457
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,090
in a nicely when your way I'm

458
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,350
other limitations include some the
commercial data set that i'm gonna talk

459
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,130
about

460
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,250
has some

461
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,220
you know conditions and limitations it
seems on what people that use that

462
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,610
can do um some datasets also or just
limited by how currently are

463
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:50,049
om stuff changes all the time new
streets are built

464
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:53,350
streets a torn out things happen and Dom
there

465
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,500
you know all these things are updated on
a they they they tell you when their

466
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,559
updated when you get them

467
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:01,178
and you have to take that into
consideration when you're geocoding

468
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:05,679
something that might be especially on
the fringes other metropolitan area in

469
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,990
the suburbs where they're allowed a new
developments

470
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,940
sometimes you can wind up with a lot of
the new stuff that's not in one of the

471
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,649
datasets

472
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,010
arm so the two

473
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,408
I'm gonna can adjust stick to only
talking about

474
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:24,080
um working within the US I i havent I
don't have any experience

475
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,730
working with international geocoding um
I'll talk a little bit about it

476
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:31,840
what I know in a minute but their

477
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,990
within the US there are to major data
sets that just about everybody uses

478
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:41,340
someone is is the tiger dataset that's
put out by the

479
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,559
United States government on its it's
built

480
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,379
by the Census biro and it's used when
they do

481
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,809
the census om they gather demographic
information block by block

482
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:57,000
and house by house and record all that
in great detail

483
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,230
and so they needed a good dataset that
word let them described

484
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,720
in a computer with exactly where

485
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,299
addresses were so the census department
developed the tiger dataset

486
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:11,500
its freely available you can download it
off the web

487
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,490
I to get the entire data set for the
United States let's not forget the bites

488
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:20,460
it comes as a big set a zip-top text
files and Dom

489
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,340
you generally you have to transform it
into a different format to work with

490
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,950
your geocoding software the limitations
of the tiger dataset

491
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,580
are that its mainly updated during
censuses

492
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,820
so %uh they they do appear they do
updated some

493
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,330
you know every couple years but
generally

494
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:44,399
you can only count on it to be real
current as of the year 2000

495
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,990
so now that we're getting into the later
half of this decade

496
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,330
arm there's a lot of places where the
tiger dataset is not very accurate

497
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,879
but it all depends on what you're doing
if you're just geocoding addresses in

498
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:56,529
Manhattan

499
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,669
you know not much has changed

500
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:04,450
the other big data set that is a
commercial product

501
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,730
is called may have tech NAVTEQ is a
company

502
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,909
oMG they have a they produced a

503
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,870
a data set that includes the US as well
as they say fifty to other countries

504
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,549
that's this a the line Street data I'm
they claim that they have people to

505
00:30:19,549 --> 00:30:22,350
drive around and check up on the stuff
all the time

506
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,720
they update their data set regularly um

507
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,940
any commercial service that does mapping

508
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,980
probably is this the nafta dataset I'm
interview with the ahu maps

509
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,190
or MapQuest or Google they all have a
little thing

510
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,460
at the bottom a little water mark that
says nafta I believe that's

511
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,240
a condition other above the law have
tech license om

512
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,129
you so left X a current dataset

513
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:53,760
it's used by most commercial the
system's as far as getting it for

514
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,179
yourself to use

515
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,029
I don't know if that's possible you know
they don't list the price on their

516
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,659
website

517
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:02,970
I have a feeling it's the kind of thing
where if you have to ask you probably

518
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,960
can't afford it um

519
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,620
but they say in how they they just give
a contact us and rest

520
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,950
to contact them about their sales
department so

521
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,149
jet probably it's its out of the reach
of

522
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:21,720
most people here so those are the two
big data sets

523
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,269
and we'll talk a little bit about the
services and the software that uses

524
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:25,950
those

525
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,370
one interesting thing actually that I
should mention about the nafta

526
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:34,360
dataset is I've been I've read an
article a couple articles and I've also

527
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,110
was just talking to Mike about this that
in order for nafta tech

528
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,870
to be able to mom determine whether
someone stealing their data or whether

529
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,049
their date has been copied

530
00:31:44,049 --> 00:31:48,120
though actually put little bitty
mistakes in their data set

531
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,460
no actually add streets that aren't
there um

532
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,629
in very subtle little ways home

533
00:31:54,629 --> 00:31:59,320
and now though tweak things just a bit I
mean I don't think the AI

534
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,710
obviously they're selling people a
product that supposed to be accurate

535
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,240
but their little hidden mistakes in
there so

536
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,460
if you ever looking at the map and you
find a street that isn't

537
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,129
really there on congratulation you found
one other little

538
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:18,100
watermarks and their data sent I i was
gonna try to do some research and find

539
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,100
an example of that before the stock but
I wasn't able to

540
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,369
tum to find an actual concrete

541
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:29,070
example to show off um stars
international data sets go like I

542
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,270
mentioned have tech says that they do 52
countries

543
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,168
I'm sure that covers your I'm not sure
about where else

544
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:39,270
that covers from

545
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,590
you can access some other countries

546
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,309
datasets through the commercial
geocoding services

547
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,440
Lake yahoo and google which I'm gonna
talk about

548
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,190
but their their coverages is kinda
limited because I think even know nafta

549
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,500
can make the data available to them

550
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,389
either they choose to not buy a dollar
it takes some effort on their part

551
00:33:01,389 --> 00:33:05,250
to to calibrate their systems and get
loaded in there

552
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,389
but I know you can geo code some
addresses in Europe through Google

553
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:14,350
from probably I think 302

554
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,919
so thats basically how it works

555
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,779
that's where the data sets come from I'm
now let's talk just a little bit about

556
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:23,039
some other services

557
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:30,039
and utilities that will do geocoding

558
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,899
um this little table just kinda offers a
comparison of them

559
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,070
the three that i'm gonna focus on our
Google Yahoo

560
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,210
and the geo colder US perl module

561
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:47,710
a the geocoding her US pro module can be
easily installed using the CPM

562
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,820
utility the comes with pearl arm

563
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,678
you have to download the Tiger data
separately after you've downloaded all

564
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:55,590
the zip files

565
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,990
the four gigabytes or whatever if you
wanna do the whole country

566
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,240
you compile it then into the Berkeley
database

567
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,950
format that the pearl geocoding module
uses

568
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,560
on thick provide a tool that lets you
recode those

569
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,139
those data files in that way the nice
thing about the Pearl geo colour

570
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:18,149
is that it's a you can integrated into a
script very easily because

571
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:22,618
you just call a function with your
address and the return to that function

572
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,369
is a as an array with too numbers that
are your lat long court mints

573
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:32,339
on it's also very fast if you have a
huge list addresses that you need to

574
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:34,679
just burn through NGO Cho tomorrow

575
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,179
I don't think you will find a faster way
to do it other than using the probe geo

576
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,980
core module

577
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:44,149
um in then it's also it runs on your
system

578
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,210
so we're going to talk a little bit
about privacy and security here in a

579
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:47,599
minute

580
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,909
and I believe that the Pearl geocoding
module is really your only choice

581
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,760
similar situations where

582
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,160
wary for the privacy of your data is
important

583
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,359
the other a major services are

584
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:05,598
web-based services Yahoo

585
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,980
offers a geocoding service they were the
first

586
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,240
as far as I know the for at least the
first major

587
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,430
company to offer than they have tech
dataset

588
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,980
through a web API if you want to the Geo
code

589
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,589
addresses and you something other than
Tiger for for the US

590
00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:26,990
on you really you know couldn't do it
without buying the nafta accent up in

591
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,339
soldier Yahoo started offering

592
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:32,740
um there they let you do five thousand
queries per

593
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,780
IP per day used to be fifty thousand

594
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,089
I don't know why they decreased the
number um

595
00:35:39,089 --> 00:35:43,940
you submit your queries through a
specially crafted URL

596
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,720
and you get back in XML object

597
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,240
this is an example love what that looks
like the shows a URL for both Google and

598
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:52,770
Yahoo

599
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:57,040
and the return code

600
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,930
other services is actually I didn't list
list in this table but there are a

601
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:03,029
number of other services one is
geocoding .us

602
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,220
um there are a couple other places where
she just search for geocoding

603
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:11,000
was on on the Internet you'll find some
pages that also offer web API's

604
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,569
almost everybody other than Google or
Yahoo that's doing about API

605
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:17,799
geocoding service it seems to be just
using

606
00:36:17,799 --> 00:36:22,009
the the Pearl geocoding module and the
tiger dataset

607
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:26,819
but then they have just written up a
little by the API for it

608
00:36:26,819 --> 00:36:30,779
the other service only talk about his
Google Google just very recently started

609
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,910
offering geocoding

610
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:35,500
even though Google Maps has been around
for a long time and even though

611
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,030
as a it when you're using Google Maps
interactively you could type in an

612
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,290
address and get a map

613
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:45,000
point love that address on if you were
writing a custom

614
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,710
Google Maps application om

615
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,230
your like a Maps mashup kinda thing like
gum

616
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:55,460
Chicago Crime dot org or or one of those
type for deals

617
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,970
all those people were actually doing
there their Maps and Google

618
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:02,830
in their geocoding with Yahoo or
something else

619
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,020
but I justices I think it was a month or
two ago

620
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,849
maybe a little more recently her little
further back than that

621
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:13,359
the world came out with the new version
of their map API

622
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,520
and now it's its kinda cool you can do
geocoding both

623
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,270
in JavaScript used a JavaScript API

624
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,290
was just you know similar to like what I
mentioned for perot you just call a

625
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,710
function with your address

626
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,299
and you get a list of Cortona parts

627
00:37:28,299 --> 00:37:31,799
back om or you can also there's a Web
API

628
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:37,339
which can be accessed like this the stop

629
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:42,009
URL shows pretty much have how you get a
geocoding

630
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,710
address back gotta go you'll see you
have a

631
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,720
you know this this URL map stuck over
the last time slash

632
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,200
maps last year ago thank you equals in
the address you geocoding

633
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,369
this is of course URL encoded says then

634
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:01,099
you have a premature output equals x
amount you can request X amount or comma

635
00:38:01,099 --> 00:38:02,549
separated for man

636
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:06,000
from both yahoo and google om

637
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,310
in Google has you sign up for

638
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:13,490
an API key and that's what this last
parameter is where it says key

639
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,000
equals and in this big old long number

640
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,170
we'll talk a little bit more about the
API key here in a bit

641
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,560
on

642
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:31,560
and that's it its that's pretty much do
it

643
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,390
well whenever you

644
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,879
I make a Google Maps page you put the
API key

645
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,250
in in the Hatters so I mean I'm not a

646
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,350
just concerned about that because
everybody has to give their API key

647
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:52,120
out but the it is tied to

648
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,330
to address will get into than just a
minute actually I'm gonna talk a little

649
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,160
bit about this

650
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,160
this API key business towards the end um

651
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,420
actually that's so

652
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:14,380
as far as the privacy in security
considerations go

653
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:20,440
I think I'm gonna try to kinda zip
through some of my stuff here

654
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,540
on one thing you should think about with
your data

655
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:28,020
is how private in security you need to
keep it on all these web API's

656
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:31,870
I checked and none of them offer an SSO
capability

657
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,100
you can't you know no link encryption
whatsoever on

658
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,390
even if you feel confident with sharing
your data with Google or Yahoo

659
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,069
anybody that's that on the network in
between you and then we'll be able to

660
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,580
see all your stuff go by

661
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,640
in plain text i'm for a lot of things
that doesn't matter a lot of times it's

662
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,339
working with publicly available and
dressed list

663
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,100
data anyway and who cares but let's say
you know your

664
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,220
geocoding allister your friends
addresses and you don't wanna just have

665
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,570
that be in plain text over the Internet
or let's say you're working for an

666
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,790
organization with their

667
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,910
does healthcare social service work on
regulations like hip

668
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,910
and a lot of fun you federal funding
require that you do not share

669
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:14,299
personal information including addresses
with third parties

670
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,870
that could exclude the possibility if
you're using one of these

671
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,980
geocoding API is free for your
application

672
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,060
that leaves you with just the Pearl
geocoding US

673
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,410
to venues on I guess the trade of the
security

674
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:32,970
verses the wedding API's a really that
easy and accurate way to do it

675
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,930
so next

676
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,940
I'm just gonna go ahead and skip over to
talking about

677
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,330
just a little bit about how how Google

678
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:46,520
works um some people have already kinda

679
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,280
mentioned there's this API key and it's
used to

680
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,250
a regulate panel what you're doing with
with Google Maps

681
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:58,660
oMG during for version 10 the Google
Maps service

682
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,830
you had to sign up for the ski and put
it in your web page this

683
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,319
this code right here's an example above
an HTML header

684
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,770
the loads their on JavaScript library
for generating maps

685
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:15,470
and you can see that in that script tag
you have to pass your API key

686
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,210
that's why your API key is no big secret
cuz as soon as you make a page

687
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,470
com you you have to give it away

688
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,590
%ah with version two

689
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,750
they started allowing geocoding google
allows

690
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,170
50,000 geocoding requests per day per
API key

691
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,020
om so you have to

692
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,840
sign up for it you give them your
information you get this key and

693
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,990
then let's say you make a page that does
geocoding

694
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,930
with it you then have to pass this key
in your URL request

695
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:53,049
each time you submit a geocoding request
now

696
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:56,580
one thing that's kinda interesting that
I discovered yesterday while I was

697
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,490
working on the stuff I've a couple a
case for a couple different sites

698
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:03,790
and I learned that you can submit those
geocoding you are all requests

699
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:07,890
even using just W get from a laptop on
our network here

700
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,549
use in anybody's API key now

701
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,280
what happens then when you rack up fifty
thousand requests for somebody else's

702
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,710
API key and their site sorta depends on
that to work

703
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,630
I don't know I leave that experiment up
to you guys

704
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:30,090
yes so that's

705
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,530
pretty much it for me on we have to a
wiki

706
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,500
where we've posted some links to some
good documentation and some things that

707
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,390
you should check out

708
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,750
if you thought we were talking about was
interesting um

709
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,070
this a address is a real simple little
tool that I created

710
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,880
um fourth just Canada learn some stuff
about the new API and

711
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,750
show us how it works for for you guys
here so check out this manufacture dot

712
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,000
com slash maps

713
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,920
I'm %uh those with them Apple the
Republican National Committee donors

714
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,640
I made Adam in like 10 minutes yesterday
just by cutting

715
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,560
up a listed addresses and pasting it
right into this kinda

716
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,110
needle to eliminate om

717
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:15,230
so that soon

718
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:18,380
okay we're gonna open it up for
questions please

719
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,300
step up to the mike to ask questions
because we want to make sure and get

720
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:23,710
this

721
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:28,280
recorded I just a reminder detail
question about I'll

722
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,290
when your geocoding at this is based on
%ah

723
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:36,070
predetermined line segments and you
mentioned on the side of the street

724
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:39,700
are as its not including the information

725
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,420
arm when you calculate the endpoints

726
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,580
are a specific side street used

727
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:50,290
and how does that exactly match up

728
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,610
if they're doing different numbers like
today's swap on

729
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:57,250
like the for some point the second point
for left and right side or

730
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:01,390
a will know there that doesn't have any
sense of the side of the street

731
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,049
and so it doesn't do anything like
slapping on even or odd numbers

732
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,390
on it just always plots points like
right in the middle of the street

733
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:13,230
certain just for the endpoints Arts &
Sun

734
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,000
each corner the street there two
different %ah addresses with two

735
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,030
different numbers

736
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,950
0 pharmacy i was just curious I said I
guess if you if you hit

737
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,190
a number that's a great on an
intersection you'd be you know

738
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,300
right in the middle love the two yellow
lines

739
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:31,710
you know where the fuck yellow lines
cross i think is where

740
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:36,170
where you'd wind up with your point

741
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,750
anything to drink the maps look better
like they just stick it on one side of

742
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,030
the line even though it's like

743
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,700
technically in the middle and like I've
seen a lot of Google Maps it like it's

744
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,470
just throw so the street so

745
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:51,020
dictators are a true liberal insiders
three again sometimes if its on one side

746
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,030
a line or the other it's actually cuz

747
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,460
Google Maps actually used to it you be
hungry maybe remember

748
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:01,320
Google didn't have the hybrid option it
one point it was just nap or satellite

749
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,920
well I think they had some data online
earth some alignment problems cuz I

750
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,100
remember making

751
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,030
like my own hybrid map when there wasn't
the hybrid option

752
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:13,290
and can you know join a screen capture
the satellite and doing a screen capture

753
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,290
the street

754
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:17,820
and then putting them together and low
realizing that they don't

755
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:20,970
even come close to matching up so

756
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,380
sometimes then they fixed and I mean
they fix then that's why now you can

757
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,100
click a difference in both at once

758
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,100
but sometimes it's just cute and it
looks like it's on one side of the

759
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,890
street

760
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:33,759
it's because it's just of rather than
that some

761
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,090
rather than that supposed to be like
that

762
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,760
I'm a GIS specialist in New Jersey
working for a county government

763
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,210
and I use the evil as a result where arm

764
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,140
which I purchased for 250 as a student
which works out

765
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,790
but on when they were giving it to use a
student like when you get your job

766
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,100
that's all you know and then you make
employers pay the

767
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:59,230
X expensive rate that's my that's all
they buy

768
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,280
so that's what I got arm

769
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,000
with the centerlines in like finding out
which saw the street it's on

770
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,200
when we geocoding streets I'm doing it
right now

771
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,110
do it from left to left from right to
write

772
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,540
which is like a pretty much just
standard so it doesn't know what I the

773
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,080
street it's on is based on how the line
segment

774
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:22,819
works like if it's going from here to
there

775
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,490
left is gonna be from last to left from
right

776
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:30,680
to write just wanna for is that
something that you have the

777
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,480
sorta work a little bit to customize for
your town or is that something that just

778
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:36,480
came with the has resurfaced with

779
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,180
know this is something that it's being
developed for the county governments

780
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,250
that it's pretty much a standard they're
using

781
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:48,310
for thanks

782
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:52,259
um another great sources JS data if you
don't want to be waiting from here the

783
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,070
next month to download all the

784
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:57,640
GIS for if you want the whole United
States

785
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,330
the United States Bureau of Labor not
labor Bureau of Transportation

786
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,920
Statistics

787
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,730
I'm sick on the website its some long
several sub domains I forget but

788
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,730
still actually send you all GIS data for

789
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,480
the entire United States on two discs
for free with Free Shipping

790
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,810
and it takes like two days and it's at
your door

791
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:21,220
Wow thanks for mentioning sha'ath

792
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,820
arm and also

793
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:28,040
arm up I'm a liar but

794
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:31,150
I don't think that you're actually able
to copyright

795
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,580
arm map data you can't I think copyright
representation a map data but like

796
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,400
you can copy write the address book you
can just copyright the representation of

797
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,330
the address in the address book so if
you're co-written

798
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:46,490
you omitted XML that would be fine arm
and you know you can

799
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:50,840
copyright human genome I think it goes
the same for map so you could probably

800
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:54,260
just smart enough tak of love um a

801
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,440
Google Maps arm put that in your own
database

802
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,890
and then you know save it to a hard
drive or something

803
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:05,350
found that interesting that's that's
probably why they have the the limit you

804
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,620
know I have a feeling

805
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,990
Google would like to just give you
unlimited geocoding I mean it can't cost

806
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,710
that much in terms of resources for them
to do

807
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:16,190
but anybody who offers the nafta dataset
seems to have

808
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:19,330
you know that this limitation how many
you can do per day

809
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,759
and I guess that you're probably doing
it to stop people from doing like

810
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:26,320
what you described yeah but that's
interesting how so you think that is

811
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,710
legal if you are able to

812
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:31,280
I'm and fairly certain it is and &
Poor's great for

813
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,980
spoofing IP addresses

814
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,690
I thought what i was gonna say was gonna
be peripheral but actually follows up on

815
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:44,190
copyright issues you just mentioning I
have

816
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:49,140
red that many map making companies

817
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:53,730
claim that the the fake streets that
you're talking to deliver errors

818
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:58,080
are actually in urban legend that they
don't exist so i was just wondering if

819
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,029
you have ever come across in any way
shape or form an actual

820
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,010
example this yes actually see some two
good years classes

821
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:09,840
steffi last spring in with there was an
example I V these is your only a call

822
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:14,010
the sector something that's not really
screws were

823
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:20,110
what kinda hard where would you
recommend for somebody to get into GIS

824
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,620
for and health or for perspective

825
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,920
for handheld ur or also like

826
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,920
I mean I have this this so powerbook and
I hate it because it is so slow

827
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,090
let's face the machine but I have just
like a a you know a Linux server at home

828
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:39,290
the Rays made a submachine to its got
fastest collided as the disc is much

829
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,960
more important actually than

830
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,500
the processing so like the RAID arrays
like this we set up the for that

831
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,160
actually like a GPS receiver oh yes at
they said yes I'm sorry

832
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,279
the verge a GPS receiver a hand-held

833
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,930
like what works best arm somebody
getting into

834
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:01,960
this for before for somebody starting up
just getting into this

835
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:05,760
arm so I have like the the Garmin each
Rex legend and

836
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,250
the reason I got that one is because it
has ago a set up base maps are already

837
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,440
put it

838
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,220
arm that seems to work pretty good i
mean they're all have their kinks in

839
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,100
like they're all

840
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:18,920
lot of them are still like cereal see if
the least feel the USB converter

841
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,870
so we're gonna do this I can open source
like I think no matter what you do

842
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:23,290
you're probably going to have

843
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:26,310
some a stumbling block in the beginning
arm

844
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:29,460
I would just say they can re-route
announcing his group and

845
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:36,460
nice people but there's only a few you
know feat ever-present choose from so

846
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:43,160
does the Tiger database includes
demographic information from the Census

847
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,509
and if it doesn't

848
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,820
recommendations on where to find
demographic information

849
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,570
you can download %ah block by block

850
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:55,150
%ah demographic information from the
census department

851
00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:00,770
om I double I'm 10 remember quite how
that links to Tiger I think there might

852
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,540
be blocked numbers

853
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,870
or something they're also associated
with the line

854
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:10,380
segments I think I know Tiger the tiger
data set itself the

855
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,190
the line geocoding dataset contains a
few extra things other than just the

856
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:17,360
lines on the point some house members

857
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,590
on it it contains stuff like this the
size of the road and the

858
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,590
road conditions like whether it's gravel
or pavement

859
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,390
om but yes you can get demographic
information you know a total breakdown

860
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:29,120
by

861
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:32,150
race income bracket om

862
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:36,740
a bunch other things number of people
per house that's all freely available

863
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,940
%ah on the web from the census
department

864
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,330
in Canby linked to the to

865
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:47,700
to address is easily

866
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,210
missus updated how often is grass
updated only

867
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:56,140
Yahoo I mean that the girardeau yahoo
and google the geocoding

868
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,150
I they use the nafta dataset and they
have tech claims to continually update

869
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,040
their data set

870
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,710
and YS summer the images blurry

871
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:09,140
cuz I go to a like a southern part of
the state well usually in

872
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,440
not in the urban areas in the rural
areas it's blurry

873
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,160
when I got a Google Maps on was so

874
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,450
I'm sorry satellite image 0 well why are
the satellite image is blurry

875
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:23,630
mom I don't know I'm

876
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:27,610
just in the urban areas is much higher
resolution images

877
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:30,980
on I think nasa world will end after it
has some really good

878
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:34,710
on satellite coverage much better than
the Google maps

879
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:37,760
oh and as far as how often do they
update the satellite imagery

880
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,060
I think it's its it's just very
piecemeal

881
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,150
like if you look at a lot of states
especially have noticed this in the

882
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,100
midwest

883
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:49,430
om ill C like in Missouri you know most
ive the

884
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,850
imagery will be like kinda consistent
but then you'll see a couple a counties

885
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:54,110
are

886
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:57,970
are blocks are things where you can tell
it was like like the images that

887
00:52:57,970 --> 00:53:01,320
photograph was taken on a different
season or something like the trees a low

888
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,730
be a different color

889
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:06,910
and %uh sometimes that seems I I'm not
sure if that actually

890
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:10,270
just means that came from a different
source or that also means that came from

891
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,070
Mike a different time

892
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:15,640
like way different than the surrounding
stuff but it seems there they don't get

893
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,230
all the like like Google Maps

894
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,460
does not use all their satellite imagery
as the same day

895
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:25,400
Pete's so where were we have committed
satellites not very close like I'm sorry

896
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,960
we get her in the queue though you're at
it up but they sought everyone asleep
