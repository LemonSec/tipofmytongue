1
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,880
the a crack

2
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,189
hella is this working excellent

3
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:28,599
alright well

4
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,309
thank you for coming um I don't know how
many have you have seen the current

5
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:33,720
issue

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,180
2600 but on if you have I'm going to be
doing

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,040
absolutely nothing new relative to what
is in my column

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,000
on but the columns kind ever complicated

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,579
on you know it's running through a
fairly complicated scenario and so I'm

10
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,580
just going to demo the what's in the
column this time around

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,320
so what this device is here isn't AT&T

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,540
call bandage on what's called an ATA

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,189
Andy Voice over IP world and that
basically means

14
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,290
terminal adapter arm and this uses this
weird

15
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:15,229
protocol that not many people use called
MGCP

16
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:19,680
and it's all locked up so you can only
use it with AT&T service because after

17
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,159
all it was only nineteen dollars or
something like that at Frys

18
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,179
and you know obviously probably cost
AT&T more than that

19
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:31,350
so they don't want you using it with
something freaky like free world by a

20
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,299
lot for instance

21
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,719
so what I'm going to do is up

22
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,359
procedure that I didn't invent gentleman
named Sigma stead

23
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,499
arm ants we're going to change it

24
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:47,869
by with the Swedish firmware for a
similar device

25
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:52,139
called the DBG 1120 ass this is the GvG
1120

26
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:55,979
M but they both user TSP aboard

27
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,789
and so by changing the firmware and by
changing the per

28
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:05,639
bootloader weekend get away from AT&T
service and use it with

29
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:09,068
a free service like free world by a lot
so

30
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:12,200
the first thing that you need is a
computer

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,730
running Windows with then Ethernet
adapter adapter configured free DHCP

32
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:21,290
on you can actually use other operating
systems but

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:25,239
I know when does and it's easier for me
to write procedures around it so I just

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,250
you know it's me it's my article and I
can make it that requirement arm

35
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,209
the you'll need to get the firmware

36
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,819
and the bootloader and there's a site
that you can download them from but I

37
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,370
have them here on my computer

38
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,640
and you'll also you known obviously need
the cat

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,330
the DBG 11:20 a.m. I can hold up the box
later and show it off to anybody who's

40
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:54,280
interested and you know you need a free
world Iowa pick out which will sign up

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,750
for

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,329
so I but the first thing that we're
gonna do

43
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:02,599
is run to do things a little bit out
order because I'm just gonna go ahead

44
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,379
and flash this stuff first

45
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,760
and then I'm gonna go and do the do the
free world I love

46
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,018
thing so I'm without any further ado

47
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:15,420
in here

48
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,870
we have

49
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,489
the for more stuff and by the way if

50
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,659
any if this doesn't work I did bring a
backup adapter so that you can see what

51
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,328
it'll look like if we do things
correctly sometimes

52
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,840
the flash process is a little bit tricky
particularly when you're in a demo in

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,829
front of you know hundred-and-some
people

54
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,829
so I do have one that that's done I
guarantee you the procedure works but

55
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,129
you know if we run into any technical
issues a lease be able to see

56
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,590
at the end what they should look like so
arm

57
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,120
well

58
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,189
it is maximized actually I

59
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,939
this is just this is just the 3 files

60
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,200
I'm that you'll need the prom code the
runtime

61
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,469
and the TFTP server so the first thing
I'm in it to you

62
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,400
as I wanna know what the IP addresses
this adapter is so that I can connect to

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,709
it so

64
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:18,950
I'm gonna go to a command prompt and
type AP can fake slash

65
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,710
all without the caps lock necessarily

66
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,299
and I can see that I have disabled my
wireless adapter and I have an IP

67
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,890
address

68
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:34,229
19 2.1 succeed sir about 12 and I'm
connected directly to this adapter here

69
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:37,250
so it's given me that IP address

70
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,240
and I typically

71
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,600
you would have something in the 1922 got
16 eat at fifteen dot something Sep net

72
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,990
so that's kinda strange so let's go see
what this is what they've done to me

73
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,520
here

74
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,359
I might have connected the runny ATA

75
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,610
I do have a wireless adapter connected
should not be

76
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,690
on and so

77
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,370
I go to 19 to you 168

78
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,850
zeroed out one

79
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,310
I have a d-link adapter and I wanna go
onto the web based management module

80
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:24,310
I'm an admin and password should be
admin

81
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,560
well by default it s ants this is a dbag
1120 s which means I

82
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,360
I have the wrong one point den I'm so
let me I get the other one

83
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,789
and like this and we should have 11:20
a.m. when I do that

84
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:45,789
this is my backup one that's already
died

85
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:03,229
so let's go back and see

86
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,400
and now yeah I've got 192 168

87
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,400
15 to you

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,170
oh now that's cool so I must have a new
revision this just came outta the box

89
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,910
now

90
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,930
with out admin as the

91
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,620
default password so

92
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:03,620
we'll see if d-link is what's on okay
will do that

93
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,789
see after the article came out AT&T
changed with fifty faults were right

94
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:22,209
I read on the web that they've done that
and I didn't think that they do so so

95
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,110
quickly cuz I bought the slick

96
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,860
this one like a couple of weeks after
the article which prospered

97
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,179
week before that so we'll try d-link

98
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,719
what's a

99
00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:39,989
oh you're not supposed to even go into
the

100
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:43,429
management module they don't like
actually include that but we'll see

101
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:50,429
see it's easy to get started you just
like go to their web page

102
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,360
in like sign up unplug your stuff and
it's all done so that's okay because

103
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,569
what we'll do is also switch over to
this one that we've done already

104
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:03,219
and all should walk you through the same
process

105
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:09,279
and you know you'll see that you'll see
that it works that's just appointing

106
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,039
this is the

107
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,378
the LAV live demos though that if you do
something without

108
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,149
you know just taking it out of the box
the same way that somebody else would

109
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:21,349
thats I set this up on purpose just so
that it's a brand new one

110
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,969
coming from the box you're gonna get on

111
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:30,519
so we'll go back to your net and you can
take to walk you through the

112
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:31,449
configuration

113
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:38,449
this and we can talk

114
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,560
more less about flashing and more about
what you do with this thing

115
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,560
one thing once you've got it

116
00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:10,390
okay so once you're in the sky basically
all you need to do

117
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,069
is you would normally start

118
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,410
the d-link TFTP server and TFTP server
protocol that

119
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,500
on basically works a lot like FTP

120
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,370
if you've ever use that and it's a way
that you transfer files

121
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,790
I'm from a computer onto

122
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,399
a device that you've attached to it I'm
typically you'll use it for flashing

123
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,820
for more on cable modems or things like
that you can also use it

124
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,970
flash the firmware on it dealing device
and so what's your in there

125
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,670
and you have your too late TFTP server
running you would go back to the

126
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,800
administration web page ants

127
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,870
in the left-hand navigation pane

128
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,839
there's a funny or update page in this
is actually exactly the same

129
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:00,829
as it would look if it was the MGCP
adapter that we've gotten into

130
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,920
and so typically what you would do
issued say

131
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,130
okay well I wanna update the firmware
and what's the address if my TFTP server

132
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:13,730
well it's the same one as my computer
and so we've gone back over here

133
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,649
and we see that 192 168 that sir at
sixteen is our IP address

134
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:25,649
so we'd under that as 192 dad 16 a

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,500
yet too fast and then we'd say that we
want to enable the firmware update and

136
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:43,779
we'd want us we would want it at the
specific file name:

137
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:47,970
and the file names gonna be i'm for the

138
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,160
prom cuz

139
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,170
for the at runtime module 1120 s

140
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,550
underscore runtime: underscore s 08 TFP

141
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,550
and so we would go under that

142
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,069
and then I'm not going to do that here
because we've already flashed this but

143
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,368
if I clicked save

144
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:25,839
then this would go out to the TFTP
server

145
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,639
and we'd ask the TFTP server for that
violent d-link actually you don't have

146
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,189
to configure it if you run it from the
same directory

147
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:37,399
that your files are an it just pick some
up

148
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,949
and since then across to the device and
at that point

149
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:45,309
once we flash the firmware then there's
a

150
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,059
then we would go back to the main menu
on the device

151
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:56,170
and we click save and restart system and
so that would reboot your device and

152
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:56,829
actually

153
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:01,249
we can go ahead and save and restart the
system so you can see exactly how old

154
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:01,749
work

155
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:05,639
and we can go ahead and save the
settings

156
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:12,600
and hit restart and there was an audible
click

157
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,639
I don't know if it came across the
microphone but when these devices go

158
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,639
there's this loud click that happens

159
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,110
and you'll see some lights plank

160
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:26,269
and then

161
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:33,269
eventually when you see your link late
comeback

162
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:39,240
after a second I double click you can
get back end

163
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,139
so we'll go back in with the defaults
and so the

164
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:48,470
thing that we would want to do is we'd
want to confirm that the upgrade

165
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,730
succeeded because when we do the

166
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,120
when we do this upgrade then a couple
things are gonna happen

167
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,350
the first thing is instead it being 19
2.1 succeed

168
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,709
15 something were and the 19 2.1 68 died
07

169
00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:09,889
so that's the first thing that we've
seen has changed

170
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,320
and if it isn't that then

171
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,440
I can guarantee you that it once you've
however you've gotten into this device

172
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,470
in with whatever password you've used in
you can search the web

173
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,050
and there are three or four different
passwords that AT&T is using for this

174
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,880
device now

175
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm my assumption was that they had not
changed at this early so

176
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,139
whatever your password is once you get
into it you know as long as you've got

177
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,490
the same firmware

178
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,810
that I've used in this which you can
also search the web to get

179
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:42,079
you will always end up in the 1922 168

180
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,060
died zeroed out whatever sup so it's not
going to be a case where that might have

181
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,980
changed to

182
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,940
on so once you've done that and you've
seen that your IP address has changed

183
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,410
and you would come back into your
browser

184
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,199
and you go to 192

185
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,440
168 that sort out one

186
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,720
at which point you'll get this and you
can login

187
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,720
admin and Admin and then the next thing
you're gonna see

188
00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:16,860
is that your configuration will be for
d-link

189
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,880
DPG 1120 s so congratulations you've
major TV G-eleven 20 am

190
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,010
that was the AT&T unit into a more
generic

191
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,920
GB she 1120 s unit the difference though

192
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,240
is sized not just the frame where
there's also a bootloader the you need

193
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,819
to change in if you don't do that

194
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:38,610
then you won't be able to actually
register to a separate server see you

195
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,490
actually have to change both the firm or
so speaking the SIP protocol

196
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,750
and the bootloader so that it's booting
into Sep

197
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,050
and being able to connect to a separate
server and and your phone

198
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:53,420
so after we've done that we need to
change the

199
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,709
a bootloader as well and we go back

200
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,810
in the same way that we did before and
we want to change

201
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:07,810
do a firmware update again and we do
exactly the same thing that we did be

202
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,110
four with the runtime module

203
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,390
but we're changing the prime cut this
time it's a it's an

204
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,490
it's the identical procedure and after
you've done that

205
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,310
you'd save and restart the system again
and I want demonstrate that it can

206
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,740
because there's nothing exciting to see
their

207
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,209
and you would then log back into

208
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:31,860
this web-based management console now
there's a really really super important

209
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,670
step that a lot of people mess I get
questions what at the time about this

210
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,170
TP I did everything the way you said

211
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,970
and it doesn't work because I can't
register

212
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,240
and my answer to that is will did you
really do everything that I said because

213
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,130
remember you have to go back n

214
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,420
and you have to do a factory reset on

215
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,470
even after you update your bootloader
and your prom

216
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,040
the settings for the device art

217
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,089
at the defaults they're still all the
weird all

218
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:05,860
MGCP stuff that AT&T programmed in for
their network

219
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,600
and that's how you do that factory reset
hip hop pole in the Sep configuration

220
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,970
settings and make that

221
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,449
on what your defaults are so

222
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:20,130
at that point once you've done your
factory reset we can now go and

223
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:25,630
and starts configure on how we're gonna
make this work on free world pile up

224
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,500
and so free world I love how many of you
guys are familiar with

225
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,540
with free world dial-up okay a tiny
people at I'm surprised to see so many

226
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,750
users does anybody else use a different

227
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,860
I'll service that does Sep

228
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,910
apart from freeroll dial-up broad voice
yet any others

229
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:48,010
free digits great so there's a lot out
there and that's one of the things that

230
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,510
make Sep Soquel

231
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,519
a by the way I've got like some t-shirts
to throw at people

232
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,370
so who knows what session a Initiation
Protocol

233
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,720
what's the RFC for that

234
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,439
that man just won a free t-shirt

235
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,040
get it to em in okay um

236
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,619
so traffic so now the so sense so many
people here

237
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,669
know what I'm free world dial up is a
doubt we need to go through what that is

238
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,100
or why it's cool and useful and all that
which is kinda caucus a

239
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,209
giving that talk but we want to put our
free world I'll up configuration

240
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,360
into this device so we can use it as an
ATA

241
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,450
and this is actually kinda fun

242
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,130
a better device to use in a lot of
respects than some of the other devices

243
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,450
that you can use

244
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,540
on that you can also flashed to do Sep
because

245
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,678
this is a really big harkin over
engineered

246
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,200
AT&T device and you can run an insane
number phones of it the reason I got

247
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,330
into this in the first place is because
my whole house

248
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,840
on is run through this patch panel and
my old Sep device didn't have enough

249
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,800
line voltage to be able to run

250
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,040
all of the extensions in my house but
this does

251
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,040
it's designed to be a straight up land
line replacement service and it can

252
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,370
bring all your phones with the full line
voltage you'd expect

253
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,909
it has some serious limitations among
them on that you need an external ear

254
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:18,460
out a bill I P

255
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,679
but thats something that for that the
hard courts

256
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,330
shouldn't be too much of a problem
usually

257
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:32,928
so we want to make this so that it
registers

258
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:37,399
aunt so I wanna go and and I wanna set
up

259
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:43,980
the SIP configuration and the server in
this isn't done

260
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,740
oh this isn't done because I set back to
factory default so we need to go get a

261
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,530
free world by Lil

262
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,800
account let somebody has their free
world pile up that they'd like to use

263
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,980
with this

264
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:00,980
now okay

265
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:08,780
and I'm out on the Internet so will turn
on the wireless network

266
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:21,980
so does anybody have any questions while
we do this about this device

267
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:28,980
or the procedure at all okay 20 there is
so yeah there's more than half

268
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,830
okay so free world I love is a is not a
land line replacement service like

269
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,980
like Vonage rainy the services that you
might it normally use

270
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,260
on actually I we can just use my free
world I'll

271
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,510
configuration that's fine ok here we are

272
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,120
and we want to get started so we're on
the free world I love page so that's

273
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
actually kinda cool

274
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,799
um so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
set up

275
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,760
on so free world I love there's a some
really interesting things about it first

276
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,290
of all

277
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:04,230
the art subject to Cali a and if you've
read my other article recently on

278
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,790
on on how your calls get listened to by
law enforcement that's a pretty

279
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,809
important thing

280
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:15,100
arm because they're not a telephone
service

281
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,700
they don't have to provide a way for law
enforcement to spy on your calls which

282
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,429
is kinda ni

283
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,460
I another thing that they do thats
that's a little bit different than

284
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,809
regular phone service

285
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,260
is they don't provide a way to make
outbound phone calls to the public

286
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,190
switched telephone network accepts

287
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,450
to certain toll-free numbers they've got
gateways but they don't provide direct

288
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,390
connectivity

289
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:41,390
and then there's third-party services
that you can use to plug in the free

290
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,630
world I'll apps you can get a real phone
number

291
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,820
out on the public switched telephone
network like you know with a 206 area

292
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,980
code or anything

293
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,400
and it'll style your free wall tile at
number

294
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,490
so people from the regular phone system
can call you but anybody was free world

295
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,610
dialup can call anybody else with free
world dial up for free

296
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,250
so it's a really handy service and it
says its

297
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,010
free so you know the price is definitely
right so

298
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,750
whole verse just changed his page chef
Paul for runs the service

299
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,590
ants I need to figure out how to get a
signed up for an account

300
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,809
actually I'm not gonna do that because
we're running short on time I'm just

301
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:19,730
going to use my

302
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,669
on credentials here

303
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,990
cell let's go ahead and log into my
account

304
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:31,610
and make sure that oh we've got an IP
address conflict that's awesome

305
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:35,890
so somebody's messing with me here
that's fine

306
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:42,890
on it's always fun to mess with the guy
doing the demo

307
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,100
so plug back in here

308
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:53,240
and we're going to need to so the way
when that happens somebody's figured out

309
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,700
what I'm

310
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,919
I p.m. on and they statically configured
on the wireless networks

311
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:03,090
I couldn't get anywhere need that's a
cool hack actually I'm gonna have to

312
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,340
remember that when anybody's doing a
wireless

313
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:11,110
a demo on the wireless network so we're
back in here and we'll go to sip

314
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,160
configuration

315
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,750
and you guys are all gonna get my number
which is which I was kinda trying to

316
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,000
avoid but that's okay

317
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
so so we want to use FWD DUP over to
calm which is what we're using

318
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,800
for which has just the standard free
world I love domain

319
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,100
and we do have to be deductible for dot
com here

320
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,440
but set know somebody secondly there too

321
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,500
are you do

322
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,830
know it's okay it's on yeah I'll tell
you one day

323
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:58,510
to blanket on yeah cuz otherwise of I'm
sure I'll get a lot of interesting phone

324
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,408
calls from

325
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:06,409
interesting people and so user promoter
phone

326
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,620
like this is there's a whole list of
things that we say we won enabled the

327
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,500
Pratt the usurper emitters for fun and
everything else

328
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,909
birch we should be able to leave at the
defaults here

329
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:24,740
so we'll save that and we're gonna
restart our system later

330
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,740
and then for use to reach an

331
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:38,520
what we want to do is don't change that

332
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,120
default value and what we're gonna and
her and the phone number were using our

333
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,680
free world I love phone number

334
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,690
it's covered up right and the display
name that we enter is just whatever you

335
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:50,700
want your name to be

336
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,150
so manual gold seen and

337
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,370
displaying caller ID I enable because
some people more

338
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:04,040
answer the phone if you don't have that
and for the authentication user name you

339
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,710
want to use your

340
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,670
free world I love phone number and you
put your password and

341
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,260
and your you'll sign up for your free
world I love phone number on the free

342
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,030
world I love dot com phone site

343
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,660
I am website and you select what you
want your password to be and then I'll

344
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,850
send you an email with your new phone
number

345
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:25,520
on free world oil so having done that

346
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,629
assuming that I have configured this
correctly

347
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:33,150
we're gonna save changes and reboot the
system

348
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,679
later custer's one more thing that I
need to do and that's to

349
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,970
and her my IP address I'll for a

350
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,030
for here yet that's fine so I wanna
ghetto

351
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:52,030
the IP address we've got it all this how
to get on the internet and

352
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,110
I have the internets you're supposedly

353
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,280
in this cable ands

354
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,290
the whole internet all the tubes yeah

355
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:10,629
um and yet so it's different than trucks
isn't

356
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,670
and 702 47 7

357
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:19,559
2.4 7 I'm so pleased helping flood me

358
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:26,559
because that's just mean ants remember

359
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:31,040
this has to have an extremely radical IP
address a

360
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,178
and if you don't know what that means
that means if you have a device commonly

361
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:36,679
sold is a router

362
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,020
on that's really just a nap device but
if you've got anything that's like calls

363
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:46,100
itself a wireless router or like home
network router or anything like that you

364
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,580
will not get an extremely irritable IP
address

365
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,240
this has to go directly into your DSL
modem or your cable modem

366
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,710
and sometimes you have to flip those
into something called bridge mode for

367
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,720
this to work so keep that in mind this
is a really bad device to buy if you

368
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,860
can't get more than one external ear
atta boy P address

369
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,050
check with your %ah provider cable modem
or DSL

370
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,700
who ever before you do and so are
default gateway is going to be

371
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,810
70

372
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,370
to 47 7 2.3

373
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,800
3 and the host name that you can enter
is just whatever you want your hostname

374
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,020
to be so all

375
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:31,020
use Makowski actually we what

376
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,050
on cuz my

377
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,399
machine is flipping out you I'm using IE
a normally use Firefox

378
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,390
by better not say that but will go ahead
and save the changes and now that's

379
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,030
gonna repeat this device

380
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,240
and we should hear a click

381
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,090
%ah caller ID spoofing I'm not covering
caller ID spoofing

382
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,670
now I'm that's actually not something
that you would

383
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,510
do in any sense other then on free world
dial-up

384
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,629
you can enter whatever you want as your
caller ID

385
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:17,000
and you can enter whatever name you want
as your caller ID and you can choose

386
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,690
whether to send it or not in this device
but that doesn't have anything to do

387
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,040
with the public's which

388
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,930
telephone system because actually if you
use the toll-free gateway

389
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:30,220
you're coming out from a number in New
York regardless of where you are so

390
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,800
on I'm sure nobody would ever want to
use a calling card to you

391
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,800
told the president that his mother is we

392
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,390
hands her feats and his feet stank but
you know

393
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,950
you could actually do that and it would
be

394
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:46,309
more or less sort of anonymous on it

395
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:49,489
especially if you set this up from you
know some location

396
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:52,070
like a badly configured you know

397
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,439
Wireless cable modem or something um so

398
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,960
now we're back in here and we can go
back to make sure that re:

399
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,740
IPA dress information was cracked
reentered the

400
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,340
and we didn't enter hostname we didn't
enter a DNS server

401
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,350
as the browser failed I do you have that
which is 70

402
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,710
the 47

403
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:18,750
that 72 the

404
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,840
34 I'm sorry this is a more exciting a
lot of you know hacking is like entering

405
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,120
things into fields

406
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,120
and we don't need a username or anything
for when

407
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,910
so we'll save that

408
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,320
and we have to restart again because
didn't take the first time

409
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,110
but it's quick the hold it appears you
can hear a click that's why the really

410
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,230
cool things the stars

411
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:45,230
clicks he

412
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:53,620
you mean like

413
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,630
did you guys hear that

414
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,890
the clock now

415
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,180
what's on

416
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,480
maybe maybe

417
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,970
all rights where's our phone

418
00:29:07,970 --> 00:29:10,990
as we're getting pretty close to being
able to actually use this is something

419
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,500
that I remembered my password

420
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,500
entered incorrectly that's why the other
fun things the

421
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,330
you have one so let's see if this works

422
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:34,428
as I do you have up liking status like
that side

423
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:37,720
shouldn't be biking should be solid

424
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,660
alright pardon me

425
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:50,660
well let's see

426
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,610
CA should be able to get out to the
internet if this is cracked

427
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,810
yeah let's do Walmart doc

428
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:16,000
K

429
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
that isn't going through so what's going
on here

430
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,710
so we do have a lanai peace at and we've
said that we want that to be manual

431
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:40,710
and we have the subnet mask is this
corrective anybody in the now

432
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,809
now we we were like on a smaller subnet
but to

433
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:54,809
so do we have the cracked default
gateway configured

434
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,170
well i camping anything on the internet
so I'm not sure we have network

435
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,720
connectivity that might be wrong number
to a plan demos we don't have like

436
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,760
correct network connectivity but we'll
see

437
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,200
pardon me

438
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,890
try restarting the

439
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:25,890
well yes for thing for suggestion try
restarting the device

440
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,330
yeah the NAP function is enabled so in
theory a should be if I had network

441
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,030
connectivity to the outside

442
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,010
I should be able to get to the Internet
cell

443
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,300
I don't have network connectivity to the
outside if

444
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,340
anybody's able to get that working

445
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,320
I know that won't do any good I have
like especially

446
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,139
like configured by the like network on

447
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,470
external ear I double IPA on this cable
supposedly but it

448
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,570
actually isn't working so on okay

449
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:06,550
if I had been able to connect then I
would demo call

450
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:10,780
but roll a blunt Hamas's that I instead
through T-shirts

451
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:16,540
people so yeah

452
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:23,540
through very well

453
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,410
backlinks UK should see them back to the
that's just

454
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:40,050
what's

455
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,940
yes

456
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,280
you have an extremely radical address
okay if you have an extremely credible

457
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,920
address

458
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:52,370
that we can get into this machine on
this cable

459
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,030
then I will have a demo that actually
works and we can call things

460
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:00,760
thats I think what you guys here's calls
yet

461
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:07,640
like making prank calls I do have a link
later

462
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,770
on this when cable I just don't have a
bike itself actually

463
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:18,770
getting anywhere

464
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,820
a somebody suggested a set the router
for DHCP and see if that gets anything

465
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:31,820
that's not a bad suggestion let's do
that and then users

466
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,080
I'm so do you have it all makes in there
okay so if I plug into the wire neck

467
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,810
do you have an external right way you
can me said RFC 1918 space

468
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:53,810
well let's just do that

469
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:13,560
oh no no campaign hassidic static

470
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,109
see yes

471
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:25,109
224 sleaze

472
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:45,690
yes

473
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:03,450
just

474
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,890
from our

475
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:30,808
okay psych no

476
00:35:30,809 --> 00:35:34,970
outside power

477
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:41,970
power restore

478
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,170
this is why Sep sucks

479
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:54,170
go i ax up

480
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:08,970
minutes to get it

481
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,380
up

482
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:39,380
on this device no it is not oil supplies

483
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:52,750
okay so while we figure out the network
stuff does anybody have any questions

484
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:55,030
about Sep in general or like

485
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:59,740
this device or like why a sack or North
Korea or like anything

486
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,460
I what's the best Linux client

487
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,740
I don't I don't know I don't to Lenox

488
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:11,980
what's the best Windows oh what's the
best when does

489
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,300
0 SSH client or supplant arguments of
our

490
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,880
okay if you wanna at softphone xlite

491
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,670
isn't bad yet you got a question yeah

492
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:29,850
I'm is there anything like free world I
loved it you can use to phone into the

493
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:34,210
public there are gaps there are a lot of
different services

494
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,550
see the cool thing about this is like
its peak Sep

495
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,840
and sip is kind of a standard for

496
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,240
arm Voice over IP and so any service
that you can find out their broad voice

497
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,980
is one of them there are lots of others
that does Sep

498
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,860
you can use this device with you can
only use it with one service at a time

499
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,400
that they'll

500
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,470
so that's why a I like free world by a
lot because it's such a versatile

501
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,440
service that allows you to call other
people or the free world dial-up

502
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,060
it also allows you to make you know
phone calls toll-free not just a

503
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,549
toll-free numbers in the US

504
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,050
but toll-free numbers and the UK

505
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:14,630
Japan the Netherlands Germany and its
kinda fun don't like make prank

506
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:18,950
toll-free calls to the UK but I'd never
do that I'm

507
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,740
next question I ya just gotta

508
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:27,180
Vonage and I just wondering if there's
anything like this administrative

509
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,220
console that you know up for their
little

510
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:34,800
are for your sorority row there's an all
that Vonage adapter made by a lynx is

511
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,840
called the PAP

512
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,000
true I believe is a crackhead and the
PAP

513
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,090
to I'll you could reflash and unlock

514
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,950
the same way that you can with this
device and you could use it with any

515
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,430
service including free world I love
course

516
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,460
Vonage really doesn't like it when you
do that because

517
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,450
they give that device you at a
considerable discount um

518
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:00,980
is there anyplace online am I find
directions I had a flash this or that

519
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,890
you just meant so yeah yeah there are
some

520
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:07,720
well if you get the no not the current
issue of 2600 but one be four

521
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,290
on it the article that I wrote on how to
reduce

522
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:16,090
how to do this device include some some
things just search for on the web that

523
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,720
will tell you it did all we do exactly
to the

524
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,250
files you need to flash this web there's
also

525
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:25,580
some other web sites people have come up
with that you know

526
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,440
Packers tend to figure out passwords
when manufacturers change them

527
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,530
and a fight had a lot of you know time
to you know

528
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,870
gas like really tough things like
instead if admin

529
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:40,390
may be changing it to administrator a as
the user name which I didn't ask

530
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:44,129
I bet I could have gotten into this arm
but you know obviously when you're doing

531
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,310
a demo you'd rather just switched your
backup but if you got this

532
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:50,549
if anybody I am once this device and
wants to hack it

533
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,910
you know like come see me after the talk
and

534
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,839
as long as you are as long as you unlock
it and you tell me how you did it

535
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:04,680
then I you can have it I you're next you
know when you use in them

536
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,190
make Sep 2 talker things like that is
their security and that hurt anybody

537
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,410
listening to your packets just listen to
your conversation that's an excellent

538
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,609
question so

539
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,280
sip is totally insecure everything's
done completely in the clear

540
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,160
and not only that if you're using most
popular code at the most popular kodak

541
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,730
is called you law which is this
uncompressed kodak that just basically

542
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,410
likely is your voice down as a wave file
that 64k

543
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:32,819
I'm it's a little more complicated than
that but not much so yeah

544
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,410
like anybody who wants to who has access
to your internet connection although I'm

545
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:39,980
sure the NSA would never illegally sniff

546
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,230
what you're doing and they could add you
know

547
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,670
anybody could listen to what you're
doing so the fact that

548
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,930
Sep doesn't arm no by definition support

549
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:54,839
a Cali air which is what I wrote about
in my last column

550
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:59,920
um which is 0 a back door that's built
into these devices so the FBI specific

551
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,550
we can

552
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,470
backdoor your device and listen to you
um

553
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,010
even though that's the case it doesn't
mean that you're in any way secure using

554
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:08,660
Sep its

555
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:13,290
its its not designed for security
whatsoever

556
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:16,380
ok I use it as a device to hook up to my
local

557
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,270
Astrix pox yes are my understanding is
and I have not done this myself

558
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:25,380
see I'm kind of dumb and like I do
windows stuff not let X

559
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,250
arm and Windows administrator search is
kind of like not very smart and really

560
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,130
lazy and you know I'm

561
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,100
basically like I fit into that mold
nicely I understand you can use this

562
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:40,730
as a as a a an extension

563
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,750
on your asterisk box so that's kinda
cool because you could use asterisks to

564
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,740
subscribe to multiple services

565
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,350
and you can also configure asterisk to
say well if I'm calling this number go

566
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,500
out through this service if I'm calling
this

567
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,690
this number format on the dial plan use
the service

568
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,860
and you could use this device I to the

569
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,880
you know to drive your telephones arm

570
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,260
and it does that a really really good
job at that because it can you know

571
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,300
literally can supply enough for wine
voltage today

572
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,580
handle my 42 line punch down block and

573
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,770
it's just nuts do that said awesome
domo-kun church

574
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:21,540
that there's there's somebody here with
like a badass time a contract

575
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:28,540
yet so I'm being told maybe we have a
network so we can actually demo this

576
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,490
our address vez or oh that OKC wanna put
an IP address on this yet what's I was

577
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:41,490
right here

578
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,590
and we've got five minutes to figure
this out our we're really gonna sock

579
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:57,150
a your YouTube just type it

580
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,410
in C instead of sending call could you
send I

581
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:04,000
us us to know you the a

582
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,660
any image file that's been in crypt
itself somebody candy collected at the

583
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,210
other end at center

584
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:14,810
so instead have sending a call can
somebody send an image file

585
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:18,430
I'm not sure what you're referring to
between what and what

586
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,549
in other words so the so what it put
instead have a

587
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,710
for use you're sending sound

588
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:29,500
taken BT cryptid at the other end oh
that's a fantastic question so

589
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,740
could you talk over a SIP connection

590
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:36,130
using some sort have been cryptid phone
arm

591
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,120
with maybe the you know something secure
like the clipper chip in it

592
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,380
um well yes you certainly can there's

593
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,670
absolutely nothing in the Kodak or with
Sep itself that would stop you from

594
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,450
using

595
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:51,980
and encrypt it telephone but on

596
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,930
you know obviously the the call setup
data so who you're calling

597
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:00,240
thats all in the clear so you can keep
that secret and that so often a lot more

598
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,400
interesting

599
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,520
arm when you're being prosecuted for
something

600
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,730
then the actual content your calls

601
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,160
were being blown-up yet

602
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,509
that kinda thing

603
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:19,359
yep hi you said numerous times

604
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:23,270
they do you need a public hearing
publicly Road oval IP address

605
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:28,300
that is not a requirement of Sep that's
just a requirement of this crappy AT&T

606
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,190
device

607
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,050
why what's the reason for that because
they're from wear socks

608
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:37,050
they don't support stun which is the
protocol that you use to deal with

609
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:37,980
napped

610
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,430
arm Sony actually if you set this up as
I

611
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,169
as an extension if you're asterisk box
in you have Astra scandal stun for you

612
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,490
then you're way smarter than I am
because asterisk is kind of hard to set

613
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:50,000
up

614
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,010
and you have to have one exploit out but
it doesn't work very well and windows

615
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:54,420
and

616
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,090
you know I'm just not that smart so
that's why I am kinda dominate use

617
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:01,750
a simple device like this and I have
five IP address anyway so

618
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:05,390
you know works on get the PAP to I
understand

619
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:08,589
if you can still find one support stein

620
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,060
so if you're able to get that then you
don't have that

621
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,060
the need to run an asterisk box can you
spell that in

622
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:20,109
what does it stand for papi to us star
host on

623
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:24,009
on no actually I shoulda kept a t-shirt
for whoever can

624
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,880
define it but get its did get is like

625
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,270
Astra Scott and he doesn't even now

626
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:36,690
its St UN yes stepped reversal something
for net

627
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:39,940
no simple traverse love you dp3 networks
or

628
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,420
nets how much bandwidth does the voice
portion of the

629
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:46,640
staying use that depends on the codec
that you select

630
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,540
and the Kodak at the more importantly if
whoever you're talking to

631
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,650
so you can prioritize which kodak's you
use

632
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,270
and but if you wanna touch if you
support a Kodak

633
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:01,970
that see you lot that somebody else only
supports and they don't support any a

634
00:46:01,970 --> 00:46:03,040
few others

635
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:08,100
then you just have to plan for the worst
case and so the worst cases 64k perforce

636
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,030
channel

637
00:46:09,030 --> 00:46:12,630
and this only supports one voice channel
so it's 64k

638
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,010
Dhamaka what's up a so there's a VMware
image out there called asterisk

639
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,130
home and I just ordered operates a PBX
and your web.config

640
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,609
can I know you have to be smart enough
to have VMware though unlike I only know

641
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:26,220
how to do virtual PC

642
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,730
it's free now come on it's free oh yeah

643
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:34,070
yeah go check it out later arm so can I
do the same setup with

644
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:37,690
astor's got home as I can without box
can I soaking up the free world I love

645
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,220
and just do it all on one

646
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:43,980
you can see here's the problem this box
is really cool because you just use a

647
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,290
regular telephone

648
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,500
I'll honey I'll things and if you set it
up right you can even make calls and

649
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,359
like they go through and stuff

650
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:57,859
on so you know and yeah like if you've
got you know your network working

651
00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:00,970
correctly and things like that so that
with that's kinda what I was hoping to

652
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,089
demo today

653
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:07,120
arm by with asterisk I mean this is just
something that runs on your computer in

654
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,299
your computer doesn't

655
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,700
you know have a plug for your phone and
it actually what you do issue

656
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:16,820
you can plug this thing into your hole
like home phone system so I've got this

657
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,300
connected to my punch down block behind
my refrigerator

658
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:23,550
and any extension phone I pick up in my
house I can use

659
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,970
so that's why these boxes and there's
this is certainly not the only one you

660
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,410
can get there's lots of them

661
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,920
up there called the TA's that's why
these kinda devices are really cork is

662
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,950
people don't like using a headset and
being tied to their computer and having

663
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:40,010
a mess around with the softphone to be
able to make phone calls

664
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,040
and I literally use this as a landline
replace makers who actually uses their

665
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,570
landline anymore I don't know about you
but I'm carrying right use cell phones

666
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,140
so the only people that I want calling
me on a landline is work

667
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,250
because that's the 1i never answer
unless I'm expecting a call from work

668
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,060
so about how much is AT&T discounting
those how much is this

669
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:05,290
I paid now I you said 20 but how much do
you think they're losing on each cell

670
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:09,160
00 if you wanna buy one that isn't
locked and that you don't have to do

671
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,310
this kind of thing with

672
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:13,779
you you can expect to pay up to a
hundred and fifty dollars which is why

673
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:17,950
for 20 bucks it's kinda cool to get one
at the zantac around on it for a while

674
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:21,170
and figure out what they change the
administrator password to use so that

675
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:21,700
you can

676
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,430
get it for 20 dollars ok yeah thanks

677
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,540
so I we've got like a five minute
warning at this point I'm we've got

678
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,670
somebody on after a student way

679
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,359
no its top time okay so we gotta stop

680
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:40,100
okay so if you guys would like to

681
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,410
see a demo of this later bring me a
extremely radical static IP

682
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,149
and I'll show you
