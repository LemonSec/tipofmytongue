well as good

47
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,230
it feels good to our level is
occasionally but you know we don't want

48
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,500
to offend anybody if anyone is offended
please leave

49
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,400
alright seriously any children in the
house itself

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,540
you know yet still a few Carl

51
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,700
we a it's a serious program because what
we are facing in radio is so all kinds

52
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,320
of censorship issues and and
fear-mongering and over censorship and

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,430
self censorship in

54
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,840
all kinds of things like that and
they're also it's a weird examples

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,240
on WBAI is where we air

56
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,870
off the hook normally are and I i don't
think it's going on over there now I

57
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,220
hope not

58
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,550
and what that means is that that we
broadcast to

59
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,860
anybody with radio in the tri-state area
as well as our people on the internet

60
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,040
WBAI has and shortwave to

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,270
WBAI specifically has II history

62
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,270
I have some battling with the FCC in
fact

63
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,440
we were the station I guess we have the
dubious distinction of being the ones

64
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,050
to make the indecency standard into
policy

65
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:46,190
I yeah I believe it was in nineteen
seventy-four

66
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,060
a crack my a 73 who is when it all
started and it took a few years to wind

67
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,390
down

68
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,390
I the folks know about this man

69
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,719
George Carlin he's caused us know and
have trouble

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,280
a George Carlin had a a bit on a a
record

71
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,040
called filthy words which a DJ call Paul
Gorman

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,350
played on WBAI pacifica radio

73
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,880
at 2 p.m. on Tuesday October 30th

74
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,880
in 1973 apparently

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,690
among his listeners was a man driving a
car with his young son

76
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,280
and that man did not want to be hearing
George Carlin talking about filthy words

77
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,260
at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon

78
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,960
so he wrote a letter of complaint to the
SEC and the SEC

79
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,380
proceeded to impose a sign on WBAI and
Pacifica

80
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,440
the station's owner at Pacifica said
that this is a

81
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,610
cultural work it should be allowed on
the radio

82
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:52,970
people want to hear it but the Supreme
Court

83
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,430
disagreed with that and so finally in
1978 is when it all

84
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,630
wound down at it was ruled that airing
Carlin's

85
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,960
bit filthy words on the radio is

86
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,609
not allowed the SEC is within its rights
to find people for playing this

87
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,800
what's interesting is that the Supreme
Court said

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,340
that an occasional occurrence of the
work fucker whatever

89
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,600
is OK they said that in context it's
fine

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,730
and that the SEC has sort of strengthens
its

91
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:28,540
power and now will find people for
single utterance or a single breast or

92
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,210
single

93
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,200
anything there's the phono incident
where what was it he said during the

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,300
Grammy Awards

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,970
fucking brilliant I fucking draw
something like that and %uh the FCC

96
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,180
originally I think they they had the
correct answer to that

97
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,960
question that yeah another cover
something live and

98
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,400
this kinda shit happens not exact words
but that then apparently the

99
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,770
the congress Kyle rage by this out there
you actually say that they're using the

100
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,120
F word is ever

101
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,230
permissible and so they've reversed
themselves and said I i believe that any

102
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,200
station airing

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,710
that would be liable even other area
live news events

104
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,290
are or you entertainment events whatever
you call it I that somehow their arrival

105
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,400
and its its sense that has been a very
scary time for us broadcasters

106
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,110
up but the and it all really begins with
the George Carlin peace do we have that

107
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,030
cuz I I would love to play the actual
peace

108
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,550
that started all this it's about and I
always wanted to do this on the radio

109
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,620
but I've never been

110
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,830
able to do that now in a free
environment like this big room

111
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,900
we can we can finally do it goes about
10 minutes you think it's tantamount to

112
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,550
George Carlin

113
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,680
her better Rep

114
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,950
over what do we do into ever seen a
curse words swear words cuss words or

115
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,380
you can say and I suppose to say all the
time

116
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,430
because words people into words what I
hear you were some guys like to record

117
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,900
your way

118
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,000
some back to you kiss and tell for

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,420
write down what words to say turn the
fucking lights on washington knew that

120
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,350
his phone was tapped his taser talk over

121
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:09,350
yes good

122
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,909
I was thinking one night about the words
you couldn't say

123
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:19,659
on the public a airwaves um

124
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,919
20 definitely couldn't say after

125
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,909
for the release a bitch when I
television was cool like she was talking

126
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,699
about on the way out but the bitch is
the first one to notice that in that age

127
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:30,409
I

128
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:36,309
0 for Friday and bastard you can say and
Helen and so had figure which one you

129
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:36,789
couldn't

130
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:41,279
and ever and it came down to seven but
the the list is open to amending effect

131
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:41,828
has been

132
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:46,540
change up by now but people pointing
things out to me

133
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,740
and I know some myself

134
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,220
the original settlers worship piss fuck
cunt cocksucker motherfucker in Tesco's

135
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,869
it was ok urs buying grow hair on your
hands

136
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:06,869
maybe even bring a sky help us piece
without honor for

137
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,960
I know the first thing we noticed was
that the word fuck was really repeated

138
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,290
in there because toward mother fuckers a
compound word it's another former the

139
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:15,870
word for

140
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,280
you wanna be a purist it doesn't really
can't be on the list a basic words

141
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,140
also cocksuckers a compound word and
neither have that is really dirty word

142
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,060
to have soccer that's merely suggestive

143
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,780
the word cock is a half way

144
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,730
dirty work fifty percent dirty 30 half
the time depending on what you mean by

145
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,420
when you first turn like and six pages
to go on the cockroach free time scale

146
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,579
call

147
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,089
to you sits in the oval concern though

148
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,570
it

149
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:56,570
first heard about cock fight and one

150
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,649
tickets

151
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,019
then you have a four letter words from
the ole ole section same

152
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,430
a shit and fuck worship

153
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:14,399
a is interesting kind word and that the
middle class has never really accepted

154
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,329
have approved the use it like crazy but
it's not really okay it's still a router

155
00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:19,600
doke cushy very

156
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,100
K but they say let's say a lady Nana

157
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,209

233
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,250
no I don't think you should cause I
don't give a shit the fact that we

234
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,599
should I would have to pack shit

235
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,809

236
00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:29,100

here and give the working out the birds

237
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:33,809
ass you should be reviewed

238
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:36,780
good

239
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,490
by the additions to the list I found
three more words I had to be put on the

240
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,160
list were you could never seen
television

241
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,930
and they were fight Jourdan Twilight
those three sorry talk about it's almost

242
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:49,000
like text security word no problem

243
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,770
Georgia can say with who wants to hear
the subject never comes up on the pedal

244
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,850
so I don't worry about that one

245
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,290
were twice is an interesting word
Twilight he read it twice

246
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,340
was interesting because it's the fifth

247
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,649
all a line of the only slightly more
applying to the

248
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,240
a part of the sexual anatomy but doesn't
have another meaning

249
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,010
to it like Gus night spots and pussy all
have other means

250
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,230
even in a Walt Disney movie you can
separate issue

251
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:24,250
way

252
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,090
that's what stands alone

253
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,530
as it should

254
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,918
and two-way words a ass is OK providing
riding into town a religious feast day

255
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:42,159
you can see I A

256
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:45,779
exists of it and the surging sales very
few just come so close

257
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:50,739
before cuando thank you for listening by
with me and fellow %uh space travelers

258
00:18:50,739 --> 00:18:57,739
thank you that the

259
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,080
okolo okay I like to think George Carlin
would approve what we're doing here

260
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,370
today I think I think he definitely
worth and

261
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:21,820
he's been a big inspiration in so many
ways and I think really the only at

262
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,139
danger anybody had listened to that
piece if they were driving was maybe

263
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:26,220
swerving off the road

264
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,530
because there was just a I mean you know
if that kinda thing offend you yeah can

265
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,000
listen to all 11 minutes and 30 seconds
of it now are you

266
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,559
maybe if you want to write a complaint
to the FCC are

267
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,350
but yeah it's a that's the piece I got
us into a whole lotta trouble at the VA

268
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,750
I and that's the piece that

269
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,210
the FCC is used in their landmark
decision to our control what we say and

270
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:47,940
over the airways

271
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,040
and want to point out that we don't
necessarily want to have radio programs

272
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,050
where we're using

273
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:56,830
foul language all the time but there are
times and places

274
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:00,178
where its funny words interesting word
newsworthy

275
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,710
are there also its examples out that and
I'm

276
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,540
II I can just tell by the Captivate it
looks and the people in in this summer

277
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,909
audience York staring at us doing radios
the sitting here

278
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,730
like you know bumps on a log which rate
is not that exciting to look at

279
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,920
I but the piece itself the piece itself
was good it was interesting was artistic

280
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,000
and how they're the FCC call indecent
South that's that's my opinion on that

281
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,749
and I guess

282
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,859
on the I'm are what stuff

283
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,859
more indecent pictures showing us wanna
explain with owners just a tease apart

284
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:43,090
piece of hearts for the SEC when think
self

285
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,580
they would call it in the sand lol
little naked kids

286
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,720
which ones are guy I

287
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,359
tile yeah

288
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,970
they're not exactly enlighten people %ah
that that that make all the laws and I

289
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,389
don't

290
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,859
I don't think we should be a listening
to their interpretation I think you

291
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,369
should make your own interpretation of
things

292
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:06,080
I'm on the subject of what george carlin
touched upon with one of the words I

293
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,749

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,620
this is a 12-year-old kid watching the
original but

314
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,820
we did some checking and stops and some
other sites say that this never happened

315
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:56,980
they point to the fact that there's
they'll fill no videotape love this all

316
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,330
happening on the carson show

317
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,080
but a lot of car since filming tape was
erased by NBC

318
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,250
there's this interview without um

319
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:11,470
Jane Fonda but there's no ironclad
evidence but on the other hand

320
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:14,720
he does in another interview explaining
that you know

321
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,120
it was perfectly innocuous so he talks
both ends with an NBC says it doesn't

322
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,700
exist

323
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,310
but hundreds of people start thousands
think it's that big fake see that

324
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,350
but the interesting thing is that this
actually aired on TV I mean

325
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:31,060
that they can use any the seven words
there by I mean

326
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,909
you know the word pussy is i certainly
consider to be an offensive word by some

327
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:35,430
people

328
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,130
so it's amazing to me that to NBC
actually aired this

329
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,410
even though nothing would today yeah
even fun to flip the reference the pussy

330
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,470
it's not that you can decide to say what
are the other

331
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,220
the reference is clearly to both
meanings of the word one of which the

332
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,880
FCC should have said is a visa

333
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,910
so in other words they're blowing off
their own definition

334
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,760
in that clip of course i think is going
before the definitions that what you

335
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,940
know here this is from

336
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,220
said that's a good question 8939 okay

337
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,510
are all the FCC has cracked down a lot
more recently

338
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,730
and there there they're really going
after right now the latest thing is that

339
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,940
going after

340
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,230
I stations that air sports programs

341
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,340
they're listening to see if any of the
the audience

342
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,419
is using swear words so take how the
hell do you control that you know you're

343
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,540
a ring a baseball game in someone you
know

344
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,580
says fuck you to somebody in the in the
crowds are gone

345
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,899
on the field and there's a rival for
that house at that they want to end live

346
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,690
TV apparently a live broadcast in any
sense

347
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,140
well they've done that to some extent
jimmy Kimmel Live's

348
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:42,690
premiered about six months before the
Janet Jackson incident that the Super

349
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,020
Bowl

350
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,860
I'll and it was originally life just the
seven-second delay for the patently

351
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,030
obscene or

352
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,110
seven dirty words after the Janet
Jackson incident

353
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,830
its taped earlier that evening so it's
had some

354
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,909
chilling effect the if not the greatly
over one

355
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:07,120
but still that's something and the
problem you get

356
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,120
i think is a we've if if you

357
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,620
I

358
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:22,040
it's a you know love decoration on
someone's yard

359
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,620
I think that's a very good looking for
felons cycle you offer any but

360
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,490
usually in philadelphia and that happens
all the time anyway I

361
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,210
here we show slides in the station's
video see them but that keeps us going

362
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,090
and makes us laugh

363
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,540
but I don't we found these things and
then if you ever get to see

364
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:46,540
even in the studio what I'm doing in
philadelphia won among them by

365
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:58,039
we were talking about the past may have
seen that we

366
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:03,580
wish to avoid said rather be well
perhaps best sale

367
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,580
yeah

368
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,870
were a puzzle as movement moving about
congress moving over here because

369
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,720
want him to get whatever's what was your
mind in the gutter something you imagine

370
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,770
something I'm standing in a part of tell
us tell us what your magic

371
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:25,820
wrong I i want to bring up some examples
are: from

372
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,240
ok our previous programs that aired on

373
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,429
on nom radio or television and there are
a number that I can think of off the top

374
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:34,230
of my head

375
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:37,510
I'm sure people in the audience can
think these as well and maybe we can

376
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,090
take some questions and answers later
where

377
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,700
your calls from the good ol days were
certain things didn't seem to matter so

378
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,309
much

379
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:48,350
ever since then the 9/11 a broadcasting
was the Janet Jackson's breast incidents

380
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,550
I mean ever since then

381
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,220
you had the most paranoid reactions you
had to over censorship self-censorship

382
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,440
are from are all kinds of words and
aren't

383
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,200
hi even offensive but TV stations radio
stations are so afraid they don't want

384
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,650
to step on anybody's toes

385
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:08,570
so they err on the side of caution and
they will never

386
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,809
they will never not do this because

387
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:15,200
what's in it for them there most radio
stations are not after

388
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,770
free speech there after profits that's
what it's about for broadcasting is

389
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,740
showing commercials

390
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,380
now many of us have have watched Monty
Python back in the old days right

391
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,990
as you guys remember I day in the life
of a stockbroker in a minute sketch

392
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,010
the I'm stockbrokers walking down the
street all these crazy things are

393
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,700
happening people throwing spears a

394
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,440
and other people around them in he just
likely going along through his day

395
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,440
he walks into the back in is to get to a
newspaper

396
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,750
and the one behind there's not wearing a
top hat all along he doesn't even notice

397
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:47,300
it this goes on is right for the show
that

398
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:52,190
they show that on PBS right here in this
country and he was before the safe

399
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,190
harbor I remember cuz I saw it as a kid

400
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,100
and yeah I was kinda shocking but the we
survived

401
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,679
they won't show that anymore locator now
alright

402
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,850
I hate to tell you bad example but that
good but the point is

403
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:09,610
they shown all these things there is
there was a TV show on

404
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:12,809
a British show again call doctor in the
house

405
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:16,760
they may never see the show way back
they use their you can look this up

406
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,010
look this up in the old TV listings that
the show was may nineteen seventies is

407
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,700
happy sometime in the early seventies

408
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,520
did you stare at 7:30 p.m. on channel 7

409
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,530
that's why I'm TV stations actually
aired

410
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:31,590
programs my the country's 7:30 p.m.
channel seven

411
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,260
and it was taking place in a strip club

412
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,100
and there were strippers and there was
tripping had they were bare breasts

413
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,030
being shown

414
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,168
at 7:30 p.m. on Channel 7

415
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:47,650
here in New York it happened we survived
is it too late for me to come

416
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,850
file complaint if I'm still offended I
think someone should say something

417
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,200
because apparently the mortgage Channel
seven now have no memory of this because

418
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,860
I

419
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,510
they'll cut anything with even a
suggestion if that arm

420
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:01,890
masterpiece theater 19 eighty I think it
was

421
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,200
they did the meals all this story to
resurrect care

422
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,890
with the actress Theresa Russell the
summer you may remember from the early

423
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,330
eighties

424
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:14,168
I in the title role and it's just a love
adultery in in this

425
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,730
she's naked and rolling around so to
speak

426
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,860
had they aired masterpiece theater 8
o'clock on a Sunday night to the early

427
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,390
eighties

428
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:27,360
can and PBS now is sour the fact the
commercial networks oh no they're very

429
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,370
afraid of any kind of our reaction

430
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,500
and you don't even know that the
noncommercial stations and I'm

431
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,429
affiliated with

432
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:37,400
are given example the USB is a station
on Scarborough terrific places where I

433
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,220
got my start

434
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:41,770
and I are we scared shitless to put it
bluntly

435
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,030
because all it takes is one was me
calling in saying

436
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:48,139
they heard something that offended them
you know what they do you have to prove

437
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,800
that we aired it we have to prove that
we didn't care and how the hell do you

438
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,330
do that

439
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,668
I don't know I but %uh the safe harbor
rule

440
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,390
for radio in this country is from 10
p.m.

441
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,570
26 a.m. you can hear indecent material
whenever they define as being not

442
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,629
obscene material in the sanitarium I
guess we can get little bit into what

443
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,970
what they consider that definition to be

444
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,169
but at WSP well you know we decided down

445
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:16,240
well with their own we could play it
safe and make it to

446
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,020
midnight just so there's no confusion
and so okay so they make at midnight and

447
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,690
then home

448
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,210
there was one of them the State Fair the
State University of New York said make

449
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:25,800
at midnight

450
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,750
and then stoneybrook we said okay it's
midnight but that's just make it even

451
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,470
safer

452
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,570
make it 1230 some all this

453
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,080
all this extra censorship on top with
the impose censorship

454
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,850
is taking place an order boils down to
is this the complete I'm cessation of

455
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,720
expression

456
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,290
and its it's sad to see this happen but
we don't have the funds

457
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:50,010
to fight in the supreme court to take
something all the way up there

458
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:53,520
and you take a look at the supreme court
these days

459
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,908
and we're not going to win some why it's
a pretty hopeless situation

460
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:02,540
and I i think really the only hope is if
someone with a lot of money takes this

461
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,490
on

462
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:08,150
I think most I'm must to the public gets
it must Republican deal with it

463
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,790
arm Saving Private Ryan I give you
example

464
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:15,110
that actually aired on commercial TV for
some reason

465
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:19,320
for some reason the FCC decided that
this was some

466
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,340
I protected work hard and they allow
that take care

467
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,450
enough before the safe harbors on before
10 10 p.m.

468
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,450
fun time yeah in prime time and I

469
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,929
you able to hear such lines as added the
frying pan into the fucking latrine

470
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,500
because there was a work of art and was
protected and he was stephen spielberg

471
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,370
are so is that they're real I think
that's a real role steven spielberg okay

472
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,190
george carlin not OK currently

473
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:52,190
apparently I'm respectfully sir sending
men all the way up to run all to save

474
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,070
one private doesn't make of fucking god
damn bit of sense

475
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,040
of anyone else does make a fucking god
damn bit of sense is all this censorship

476
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,240
going on

477
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,370
broadcast TV and the funny thing is
cable TV

478
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,480
is not affected by this yet

479
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,340
cable TV voluntarily follow the same
rules because they don't want to offend

480
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,220
anybody they offend somebody

481
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:16,940
maybe they won't get the FCC on their
ass but the they might lose sponsors

482
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,179
now an exception to this was at South
Park

483
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:24,630
episode where they said shit how many
times

484
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:28,790
over a hundred times and you like a
given credit for doing that but the

485
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:33,918
for the reaction that guy I mean come on
it's it's it's a word is one word

486
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,100
and it's a funny show anybody watching
South Park i think is heard the word

487
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,930
shit before

488
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,710
and the issues that they have total
control over what they're watching if

489
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,900
they didn't want to hear after the first
instance

490
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,510
they could have changed channel measles
absolutely

491
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,320
other countries this doesn't that just
make a difference at all other countries

492
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,470
they don't live under

493
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,850
this kinda I consider a depression I
really do we don't cuss on off the hook

494
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,970
we don't want a cousin of the but
occasionally

495
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,100
we fucked up alright occasionally
somebody call then

496
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,710
and we're gets out I mean we call
somebody

497
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:10,810
this happened a few months ago we call
somebody are you single wheezing

498
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:15,020
that's what your Skype using Skype we're
testing it out for the first time we

499
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,060
week we call the friend of ours and she
had never used it before

500
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,899
we're sure very new to it and we call
her as soon as we call her and she

501
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,630
picked up her on the phone rang

502
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,260
so what's the first thing you do when
something like that happens it's a real

503
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,090
shame

504
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,230
that's what she said and I'm like oh my
god I had fortunately we're in the LaCie

505
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:38,860
didn't hear it fight she was mortified
and I think we've heard from her since

506
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,920
Emanuel how to sell frightening a menu
how does that work and in that instance

507
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,370
I had to seven-second delay but who
actually knew did the year

508
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,900
to delete speech I did I i you what you
have but Martin

509
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,760
who had my act now now how many times
longer every how many times the past

510
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,660
couple months have you had to push that
button

511
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,230
not too many times our listeners are
usually pretty good and what goes

512
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,710
through your mind how you feel

513
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,870
when you feel like you have to press
that button well one of the words go

514
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,659
through my mind that I would have to
center of a laugh now but I mean

515
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,980
seriously what what what emotions do you
feel

516
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,918
when you realize you need to press that
button under government order

517
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,330
but what does that feel like it doesn't
feel good about my feeling panicked

518
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,730
I'm feeling rather pissed off that I
have to do this because in most most

519
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,949
contacts I think our listeners can deal
with the language

520
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:30,879
we've had we've had europeans are show a
number of times we've had dropped in

521
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,918
Amsterdam and Andy from the CCC

522
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:37,138
and I'm almost are with this has
happened a couple years because we have

523
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:38,490
had mine a couple years

524
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:43,360
but when they come on they dislike talk
freely and they say yeah I think it got

525
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,690
kinda fucked up it's like they don't
even realize

526
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,659
they're speaking a foreign language you
don't even realize that those words are

527
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,460
not allowed

528
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,899
and what I'd like to ask him the people
here we take some questions

529
00:34:53,899 --> 00:35:00,899
and that's what are the words few can
you believe that you can see fits

530
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,620
file that's a good looking parrots

531
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:12,220
five is saving outline for us

532
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,040
this speaking a foreign language in and
they don't even realize that they're

533
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,319
saying these words are forbidden

534
00:35:16,319 --> 00:35:19,609
and might like to ask the the people
here is

535
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:23,520
from your country from other countries
are their words are their words that

536
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,569
are actually forbidden for you like I
know in England the same bloody means a

537
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:29,369
lot more than it does here

538
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,369
but you guys still say it on TV still
saying I'm

539
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:37,540
on the radio on in phnom you guys watch
Sex in the City they they put on a

540
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,490
commercial TV now I've never seen it but

541
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,430
my god it's not from what I've heard
it's is just kinda incredibly 49

542
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,960
originally aired on HBO and if you watch
The Sopranos

543
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,270
that's gonna Eric commercial TV in a few
years and you will recognize

544
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,309
because they've they've made alternate
audio

545
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:56,760
for every single episode

546
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,600
the the comet the cover was just panning
shots

547
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,700
new jersey so I mean every shade is
going to be a shoot every fuck is going

548
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,540
to be a freak

549
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,940
in hindsight everybody knows the words
are for some reason that satisfies

550
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,770
America and were not offended

551
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,020
it can really imagine his character's
saying moshus your

552
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,680
or if you wanna preview drive through
this fine pulp fiction and on channel 11

553
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,200
a few years ago I'm I got all the words
they made up their workers is that no

554
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,390
one ever heard of before

555
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,960
but that the violence the violence stays
in my

556
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,830
when they whack big pussy in the from
how they can work that out I guess

557
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,610
yeah

558
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,220
you want to shoot him in the head down
in the water however not running for

559
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:38,600
money

560
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:42,170
that's gonna stay in there that's okay
it's okay to show people my head and

561
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,900
decapitate them all I kinda stuff it
owns the ship when you do it his ass

562
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,440
that's going to offend somebody it's
it's it's universally screwed up by the

563
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,470
menu on on live broadcasts like

564
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,360
off the hook I'm gonna lives of others
thank you

565
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,500
I I see this is

566
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,910
this a former censorship particularly
insidious because it

567
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:07,390
it imposes on on

568
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,470
us on the air in a way that almost makes
you feel

569
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,690
like you have to overcompensate because
you don't know exactly

570
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,050
where the line is on because the
government has been completely clear

571
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,110
about what's appropriate

572
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:25,490
what's legal what's not legal working
with three hundred twenty-five thousand

573
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:28,300
dollar fine the next to the speaker
individually now

574
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,040
this is not to the station on you you so
far have run up

575
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,570
how many millions of dollars in fines
and I'm if this had been aired

576
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,470
seriously I and and the FCC is already a

577
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,160
a fine a individuals up more than once

578
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,160
with these high fines I mean for the
same same

579
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,259
string of words in the same broadcast so
they're not you know they're gonna run

580
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:50,600
these

581
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,740
consecutively um in there anyway

582
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:56,970
the self censorship thing I find
particularly disturbing because up

583
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,610
naturally broadcasters are gonna

584
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,730
com overcompensate just to be on the
safe side

585
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,230
and that just lowers the that I call it
a homogeneous Jays homogenization a

586
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,480
content because this lowers it down

587
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,680
to just something so in ninety West it
seems to like me

588
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,230
one other interesting things that we
have to do for of the heart is we once

589
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,230
played this kind of innocuous said

590
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,440
German the whole tell telephone hold
music song

591
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,620
which is about how they don't care that
Iran halt and

592
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,670
now they're bad up

593
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:33,480
this German thing i download it i
download something called the radio edit

594
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,900
version which I guess means they edited
for length

595
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,830
and the sign which is entirely in German
contains the word size there which means

596
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,660
shit

597
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:44,549
so you can't play that on american radio
so I had to

598
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,620
edit this song in a language I don't
even speak area it's entirely possible

599
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:53,170
that if I hadn't bothered to look up a
translation I wouldn't have known him we

600
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,460
would have aired it and got in trouble
it's very

601
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,290
nebulous so someone says hits since what
really when we're liable

602
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,060
we could be a he say tits the Swahili
I'm gonna say it

603
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,890
see if I don't know it's been a long
time since I read catch-22 I'm sure

604
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,830
somebody audience has read it recently

605
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,029
is that they were character in their
cult show I scoff

606
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:16,790
which is German for shift head still
seven you can read catch-22 even with

607
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,250
the obvious dirty words

608
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,170
edited out over-the-air we can you can

sounds and on network a

00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:29,770
verbatim without incurring %uh the
rather the FCC 'em

631
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,380
I am several hundred dollars thousand
fighters it's really strange one owns

632
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,690
aware of Arabia over television station
that did play this

633
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,830
I wanna know I wanna file a complaint
and i wanna see what happens

634
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,700
lccn: CNN is on cable television and
they are not subject to these rules even

635
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,950
though they mostly abide by them now
this week

636
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,180
we had some debate about that because
you have these guys wanna see these a

637
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,560
push push cursing you sure you ready for
this

638
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,120
you could be dramatic on book why not
we're not sure if this

639
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:00,120
aired on TV or just on the website ever
seen on tv where they actually use the S

640
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:00,520
word

641
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,000
did okay so let's let's share this is
the report and don't take some questions

642
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,490
a call to my phone I saw it on BBC World

643
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:13,360
of course it seems yes RA can really
make this full screen

644
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,260
committees dominating this agenda right
up literally until the final moments an

645
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:18,450
open microphone

646
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,990
up phone capturing a rather frank and
dramatic exchange between president bush

647
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,860
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair

648
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,440
that highlight some of the tensions
among world leaders about the way

649
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,460
forward in mideast stands in sharp
contrast to the united front that was

650
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:36,810
publicly presented yesterday by this
joint statement among the g8 leaders

651
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:40,080
about the mideast in the way forward
what happened first this morning to do

652
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,690
some context is mister blaring UN
secretary-general coffee and

653
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:47,270
I went behind closed door doors for
meeting that spoke to reporters and

654
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,340
jointly called

655
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,580
for International stabilisation force to
end the violence in the mideast but such

656
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,140
a force

657
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,259
might require a cease-fire which is
controversial because president bush has

658
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:59,520
not support a cease-fire on the grounds

659
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,350
by that the white house doesn't believe
Hezbollah would necessarily follow it so

660
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,500
after meeting with mister and mister
blair sat down for lunch with President

661
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,290
Bush the other g8 leaders as well

662
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,370
and the president in this conversation
expresses frustration

663
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:16,620
that the UN should be doing more to
pressure syrian president assad

664
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,890
to get hezbollah to stop the violence we
need to be clear

665
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:23,859
that the leaders knew that this was a
photo opportunity mister blair

666
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,210
eventually turns off the microphone that
was on the table but not before this

667
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,180
okay so all oooo

668

695
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,320
description of the video did we mention

696
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,740
about the big story

697
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,790
was that he said shit the big thing

698
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:07,410
that was it not nothing about you know

699
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,310
gonna do in San income is wrestling now

700
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,360
is is that he said shit that was the
important part okay I we're in trial SMS

701
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,410
amazing questions my friends right up
there just

702
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:18,819
run up and ask questions do we have the
slide a

703
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,730
was that statue outside the justice
department they actually covered up

704
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:26,090
because they were freshmen much the
oppressive this

705
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,640
no I wasn't bad sure isn't that

706
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,870
yeah that's the one they actually have
bought

707
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:36,880
curtains to cover this of so that when I
gave speeches

708
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,080
wouldn't see that behind and and there's
a famous photograph when a

709
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,600
Attorney General a under reagan it niece
a

710
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,030
the strange no-one when there is a 7
decency a red

711
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:50,490
regulations were being handed down by
that rating administration and urged

712
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,470
classic photographs by the press as

713
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:56,040
a telluride me standing for the statue
you know

714
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,040
with it it's hanging out over his head
if this is great picture and now

715
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,690
that's never gonna happen because
somebody cut health for it I just like

716
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:03,810
to point out in a

717
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,930
be as a radio station in a in Seattle

718
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,220
there's a race in Seattle where the

719
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,860
morning talk show host Tom is fighting a
lot of this

720
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:18,790
and he got he went to a a meeting with
the SEC representatives and he said

721
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,640
give me a list upwards i cant say

722
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,799
and they would never give it to him he
said wolf is this because

723
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,560
if you give me a list it's violating my
first amendment rights

724
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,330
and they were just kinda silent on that
her there they will be silent when US

725
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,080
Pacific questions like that for sure

726
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,080
I'd also like to point out that I M P
are actually

727
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,150
aired I bush saying shit and they're
actually think he told them he said

728
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,530
message fined them the maximum out and
npr's actually fighting

729
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,560
the whole national public radio network
every single station on the network

730
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,770
aired the worship before 10 p.m.

731
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,110
yes interesting this this could be

732
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,030
a good test case others to sit in my
closet no souls to the fact that okay

733
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,470
let's

734
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,710
try to get to the fast fat know that
here um

735
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,850
how much of this controversy the recent
controversy over

736
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:13,650
on the my clothes my how much have the
recent controversy over obscenity and

737
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,430
profanity and television is just
manufactured by groups like the tech

738
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:19,379
Parents Television Council another

739
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,410
lobbying group an activist group that
basically push people to complain about

740
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,240
shows

741
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,800
even if they haven't seen the show how
is absolutely

742
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:32,050
a contrived by the religious right's to
to get their agenda out there

743
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,110
and if you get a lot of people
threatening in writing letters

744
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:38,560
yet does have an effect unfortunate
people on the other side are the more

745
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,040
intelligent than that they don't all

746
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,490
act as one highs and I

747
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,150
and they're not they don't appear to be
as as organized but I think

748
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:50,640
I think public sentiment is a guess I
kinda thing we just have to figure out

749
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,270
how to fight it

750
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,259
okay in the back there and I just give
you the UK perspective

751
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,300
and day red

752
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:03,280
just like on the CNN that they that in
mind you using swear words

753
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,300
if it is in context special his life am
but effectively they

754
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,200
there's no less than anything if they
they just complain if you take any

755
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,280
complains lol

756
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,920
they'll work it out said not having
lists

757
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,960
is a good thing but also means this your

758
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,300
it's up to them with you find out in the
BBC with them

759
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,620
a bit on Jerry Springer the opera you
may know that's

760
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,410
but offensive some has but three injured
swear words in it a.m.

761
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,170
that and a Lego 45,000 complaints they

768
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,710
if I do in Yahoo and MSN don't know what
web sites are blocked and so they do a

769
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,530
certain level of self censorship

770
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:00,380
are and that greatly increases the
number love on things that don't get
