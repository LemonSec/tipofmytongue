this Sun this panel came about as a
result about

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,670
a discussion rockin I had an Amsterdam

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,920
last winter I believe we've both
drinking heavily at the time it was just

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,170
too

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,229
civilized conversation I'm not sure how
these things go about

27
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,140
never drinks okay well maybe I was
thinking everywhere now

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:37,380
I basically 2600 meetings began in 1987

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,509
I in New York and expanded to

30
00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,219
other cities like Philadelphia and San
Francisco on thats

31
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,340
at some point Washington DC and then
there is the the raid on the Washington

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,899
DC meeting and that resulted in an
explosion of getting so we have meetings

33
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:53,090
all over the world after that

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,130
I just never really gone down and I dot

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,740
the meetings are interesting there was
take place in the first Friday of the

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,320
month

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,439
and basically people interested in the
magazine rack in general just getting

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,130
together in a food court someplace

39
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,670
i gather at that time and they've been a
variety of positive and negative things

40
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,000
and what we're gonna focus on both

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,810
this particular this particular panel in
the courseware

42
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,840
open to suggestion an important stories
that you might have

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,630
so I guess so what you wanna started you
want to finish

44
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,450
which where you wanna go I'll finish
okay so we'll start over with the

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,910
low of 31 starts at home when did you
first are coming to meetings where the

46
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,329
meetings you went to was

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,660
yeah I think I think I started coming to
meetings a long time ago maybe the

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,910
play with my pleaded with me start

49
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,760
1987 yeah I think maybe out before the
nineties 89-88 something like that

50
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,530
and %ah I remember my first meeting I
was running a BBS back in those days

51
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,560
and %ah I made fiber optic

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,770
and I apparently I he had got dialed
into my DVDs and pulled my our records

53
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,960
any of I met him in the first thing I

54
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,220
he said is you I and my full name and he
pronounced it correctly which is no easy

55
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,120
and I gave you my address so is very I

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,440
it was exciting it was exciting yeah

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,320
and scary meeting for me people view doc

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,500
yes file and

59
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,930
jeopardy gym here you've been at many
new york city meetings yeah I started

60
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,510
the

61
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,670
coming to meetings in 1994 I just to
have hope

62
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:40,690
the original one and the

63
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,760
I've attended I'd say that
three-quarters them since then

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,620
including so the more infamous ones the
the the 60 Minutes expose where they

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,320
tried to get us to talk about pictures
I've women and donkeys on the Internet

66
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,489
a the the the one where the

67
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,200
director and art director of hackers
came looking for information and

68
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,440
Angelina Jolie even a vid

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,140
817 was too big a star to talk to us so
she just

70
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,170
skated around city course Center you
guys know the edge initially came to

71
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,360
whatever meetings miss something the
etiquette and loss of

72
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,930
where she was last year's a nice kid she
we weren't as pretty as Brad Pitt even

73
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,260
that

74
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,320
yeah this was when they were making
their

75
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,450
the after after this panel

76
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,440
call the women in the audience just beat
that guy down for thing there was none

77
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,740
of the above

78
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,220
go what is she was actually very
friendly we have we're doing some stuff

79
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,030
with hackers

80
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,030
side by saying them not to do certain
things that they wanna doing anyway

81
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,900
and I'm it just kinda kinda a mecca

82
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,180
I guess for a lot of people that this is
where the hackers are

83
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,970
right or wrong they came to the meetings
the movie hackers would never have been

84
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,849
made without the new york city meeting
because the guy who wrote it

85
00:04:54,849 --> 00:04:59,110
which show up at the meetings and get
material and even even I handles

86
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,539
from various attendees so they're
they're people who came to the meetings

87
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,880
who were in that movie and he basically
bar their characters

88
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,909
and I think there's some good and some
bad in that but it it does make for some

89
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,440
historical moments as jim mentioned

90
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,090
Mike Wallace from 60 minutes was at one
of our meetings doing he was

91
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,580
interrogating aspect various

92
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,060
positions at da keys in sexual poses I
don't know what the hell he was thinking

93
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,530
of

94
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,380
why we have anything to do with this but
down apparently that's his definition

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,569
attackers a bernie here and

96
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:33,289
when he was in Philadelphia he went to
the Philadelphia meetings and I'm

97
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:37,940
well I'm sorry to say probably a direct
result of the Philadelphia 2600 meeting

98
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,729
is what landed him in prison

99
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,520
yeah 5 is an elite in

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,109
I think isolated yeah but on well

101
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,060
a bit an 87 after the first 26 first 26
having Philadelphia was an 87 and it was

102
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,479
a

103
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,860
only three people showed up Emanuel who
tried to get going %uh

104
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,889
myself and of Mike you haha you know
that's rate who knows

105
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:04,520
no more area codes and anybody and he
knew all area codes still does

106
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,090
it's amazing %ah and I was sort of a one
time thing that Philadelphia meeting

107
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,919
I but about three years later I have I
started the 133 East 30th Street Station

108
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,000
in philadelphia

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,710
under stair well seven and that was very
popular live people start showing up

110
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,680
a few months after it started we had
attended tendances

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,699
a up to 40 people I

112
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,789
at that meeting and I got so I with the
I I called the

113
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:35,380
I bell-atlantic mobile systems I
technical apartment got to

114
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:39,800
to bill the sailor engineers to come and
give us a presentation about how their

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,930
share their network works

116
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,130
and a the social engineer them into
giving us some information about it

117
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,039
whereas some other clinton was located
several stories underground

118
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,260
33 station in the catacombs and then
that after eating we all went down

119
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,849
explored and found a question but

120
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,430
%ah it was an easy there but

121
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,849
you ever other styles we went down there
the time they were they were hot titles

122
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:09,190
I'll man was like this I did venture
there likes to have everything

123
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,949
but I'm has anyone here not explored a
tunnel ever

124
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:16,940
its most awesome thing that and don't
conduct also the oldest titles I can say

125
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,349
their titles here but don't go there

126
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:22,870
now they're gonna go there but this
really cool thousand hotel across the

127
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,200
street cuz I

128
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,140
so the Philadelphia meetings a really
took off well

129
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,150
and and they they went well for about

130
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,740
from in four years or so and

131
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,600
it turns out to I was started bringing a
quartz crystals and

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,130
unmodified touchdown dialers to that
meeting and and

133
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,640
at this guessing someone with the state
I can't wait a minute I suggested well

134
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,789
he suggested that the

135
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,810
with the a public service to the hacking
community said

136
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,910
because they couldn't it was really hard
to get wannabes trestles so I'm and I i

137
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,510
that contract with the crystal
manufactured is to make a large Batcave

138
00:07:59,510 --> 00:07:59,900
them

139
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,150
I so be affordable and Vit B I know why
the crystals were

140
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,620
wanted oh yeah how about the crystals I
Crystal Method

141
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,280
crystals with magical powers its
officials with magical powers it

142
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,210
requires that I can take credit for

143
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,700
on there is a great article in 2600 I
forget who wrote it

144
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,080
but on someone determined that the a
touchdown frequencies

145
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,430
were it the ratio between the two towns
annotation figures pete was almost

146
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,760
identical to the ratio

147
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,200
the two counts used to by pay fans to

148
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,700
the signal acorn deposit to the central
office and if you just change the quartz

149
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,630
crystal the tiny crystal in a touchdown
and i love you by Radio Shack or

150
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,039
something

151
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,468
then a it was shifted to the frequency
that was right with intolerance

152
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,370
and you could bike store feisty stars
are asterisks in and which in a way to

153
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,870
send a quarter going to pay found

154
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,460
sufficiently well enough to take a call
anyway you've all heard on the radio

155
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,080
shack tone dial thing now

156
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,150
I i forgot about this that that actually
printed in 2600 and I i guess that makes

157
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,910
us responsible for this whole expose
actually it is your fault you

158
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,150
are mister french I think was so was the
guy that did that he's a guy I met on

159
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,250
the voicemail system

160
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,770
by accident just fight both attacking at
the same voice mail system using taxes

161
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:09,610
are as in New York

162
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,640
they just wrote a letter when they say
hey guess where I discovered in

163
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,240
and and the whole telecom industry it
was affected by the fact that that could

164
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,540
have

165
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,150
that that works that hack worked was it
here in the article

166
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,240
beyond luck it was like a divine in

167
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,620
intervention I mean there's think the
chances above those two

168
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,210
frequency ratios being so close were

169
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:34,420
you now million to one so somebody was
looking at flights

170
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,569
this home was looking out for you now
lol anyway turns out that that one

171
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,690
wanna the people if they tended to 26 i
meeting in Philadelphia turned out to be

172
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,690
a federal informant

173
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,470
and ultimately at contact the secret
service I

174
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,460
after my initial arrest and gave them a
lot of information about stuff I was

175
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,000
I was talking about the meetings none of
which was about fraud or anything was

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,839
just simply about

177
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,150
on disturbing these parts and and
software stuff not which was illegal at

178
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,430
the time I had done that

179
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:05,940
at those meetings but a new a new
federal statute have been enacted

180
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,990
ups a few weeks before I was charged
with aiding that we can talk about that

181
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,350
the action from his prison

182
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,580
thing later but bottom line is a I
haven't been to a 2600 meeting in

183
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,070
Philadelphia since Sat

184
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,209
since that for about five years after I
started

185
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,900
I Y showed up to after I hope prison
experience and sure enough the federal

186
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,420
informant

187
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,839
on was there and I guess I can che's
named Paul Bergman

188
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,510
the the crowd over to raise your hand it
is OK

189
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,970
do it go get a Rotel room there faster

190
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,610
anyway I I'm I'm a firm believer of not
says

191
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:43,220
getting wolf r-va letter from believer
if not naming other individuals in any

192
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,810
kind of a

193
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,810
a case the he doesn't really I help the
situation

194
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,480
and ice take responsibility for your own
actions and let the chips fall where

195
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,240
they gonna fall

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,110
because the government relies on says
tirade about their general government

197
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,240
relies on people reading each other out
and just

198
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,970
dis say talk to my lawyer everybody
would

199
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,330
would have a much easier time with
anyway I back to the 23rd meeting set

200
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:09,630
the bell annexes and engineers they
showed up um

201
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,850
really getting graced technical
presentations we had engineers from at

202
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,290
I I'll local a insurance companies
talking that they're at their networks

203
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,120
and so forth and

204
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,589
we would really like a seminar kinda
thing and I haven't been too many

205
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,120
meetings outside of the Philly in New
York but some

206
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,140
is just so much knowledge get spread
around in a in a casual way that

207
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,100
and it's not going to happen in in any
other kind of setting and it just sorta

208
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,570
had takes a life on its own

209
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,410
okay our lexicon from New York City

210
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:42,920
finally from North Carolina um

211
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,430
I I A on I

212
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,660
upstream magazine in the %ah a bit guess
mid nineties

213
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,110
and I listen to the radio show and I
thinking

214
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,780
it would be great if there was a 2600
being near me

215
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,920
and I was down in Wilmington North
Carolina

216
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,479
which is a fairly small beach community
and %uh

217
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,339
there was no the 2600 meeting and %uh so
I put up

218
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,440
um website INC 2600 .org

219
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,949
and done said anybody in north carolina
de wants to do something with my 600

220
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,430
on contact me as starting LIRC

221
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,000
and now we have a I'm up here in New
York now but we have

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,290
last month twenty two people showed up
in Raleigh for the meeting

223
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,230
which is up pretty good number for up
meaning

224
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,480
way out love new york city in
philadelphia justice

225
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,410
small place the south so um we just
kinda

226
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,110
kept things snowballing by on having
point a president's kinda thing where

227
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,190
were on IRC and we're on the web and you
can

228
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,520
find people and talk to people and ask
questions and before you go to the

229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,410
meeting find out what it's about

230
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,209
and %ah hitting the magazines with
flyers to

231
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,079
get people to you know going to Barnes &
Noble stick after page fire in the

232
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,360
magazine that says

233
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,890
this is where the local meeting is we're
actually here come to it

234
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,000
and %ah just building that sorta thing
to build bigger and bigger

235
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,280
meeting so more people cream would be
interested in it

236
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,430
know that it's there and so

237
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,910
that's mostly what we've been doing and
to then um is last year

238
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,300
we put together Carolina Kong which is a
conference that's like a super meeting

239
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,280
for all the meetings in North Carolina

240
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,360
and we had people come from all over the
place to show up to that it's like a

241
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,709
kinda many hope just for our state
bringing it together

242
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,890
and that was a lot of fun so we did
again and

243
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,319
will probably do girl aka Carolina Conn
3t on next

244
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,320
jim says socks and pants

245
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,380
as I mentioned earlier I had a
conversation with Rob over the

246
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,520
winter and it I i think it's very
important for us to take a critical look

247
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,550
at what it is we do and analyze just why
it is we do these things that I was a

248
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,000
great discussion because

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,230
Rick pretty much tearing the meetings
apart like

250
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,550
are they worth while this is something
better something bad what's the

251
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,180
with the negative things that come out
of it how do we make it something

252
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,839
positive outlook for up to make

253
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,680
so those points occur does that they
really are worth looking at

254
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,310
well to start off with I haven't been to
that many meetings but I've been to

255
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,970
some over the years I'm here maybe once
a year months every two years

256
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,130
and I guess I've always been to at least
one meeting when I was with

257
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,970
with you on Long Island I'm weave into

258
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,240
some of the first meetings in California
I think they weren't a

259
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,600
Emanuel help me out here we went to the
severance is it was even in new

260
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,329
and work in a row we went to the hair
care center and into Los Angeles into

261
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:47,560
one is and you know

262
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,820
Los Angeles think we had to people show
up there was very small at the time

263
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,170
yeah I at least in one of the city's it
was the very first meeting I think

264
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,600
so we I I was there for further the
California trip and then

265
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,209
through the years vinson meetings in New
York and and

266
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,540
to be totally honest I'm I can stand
shopping malls

267
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,969
so that's a big part is that's a totally
big part of me hitting the meetings but

268
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:12,829
I really don't

269
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,329
don't like a they're not my thing I'm
that's just me personally I'm not sure

270
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:19,230
that that matters to anybody else

271
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,860
but I also think shopping malls are
really bad place for for for doing stuff

272
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,339
like this it's it

273
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:28,740
it makes the community looks like a
bunch of geeks hanging out at some

274
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,459
this I don't know it just to me it
doesn't feel right but thats

275
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,709
maybe just me but it just feels very
silly and stupid

276
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm even if good things are happening
there even if this this the perfect

277
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,740
people got together and had the perfect
conversations

278
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,040
I'm I would still feels it is what am I
doing here this is artificial light them

279
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,860
in some stupid

280
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,920
that this is security card passing by
every 30 seconds to that's america

281
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,529
but no I'm not necessarily I don't see
security guard passing by me here every

282
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:01,570
30 seconds so

283
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,880
so I think fact they write

284
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,490
I'm surveillance

285
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,649
yeah I know house I'm

286
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,430
how many cancers heart attack I i've
been

287
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,649
when I was hanging around on bulletin
boards in in the eighties

288
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,410
and I was trying to get to meet people
and there was nothing there there were

289
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,439
no structures there was nothing there

290
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,320
it was important to meet someone
someplace in town to use public places

291
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:29,980
to

292
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,020
to get in contact with people I'm

293
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,430
I'm not so sure is that useful now I'm
I'm not so sure that it's it wouldn't be

294
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,850
more useful

295
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,010
if if there was more structure to it if
they if it was les IVA

296
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,250
I'm passion I say just

297
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,570
and and trying to find the

298
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,020
the proper English terms right but I'm

299
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,250
an agenda perhaps well imagined I would
be nice but that's not always necessary

300
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,320
bed that

301
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,699
I more nervous ends up being in your own
space

302
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:08,390
and not so much the sensor being a
buncha kids hanging around and being

303
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,919
of noxious even because that's not

304
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,089
what we are we are not a buncha kids
hanging around being obnoxious why

305
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:17,918
pretend why

306
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,110
maybe it's just me getting older maybe
that's just me being as a

307
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:24,720
I don't know if that's just a
generational shift first part of that is

308
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,890
is is the form that is chosen

309
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,010
and and the question for me is

310
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:34,750
in to what extent is the form we choose
define who we are

311
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,760
does it make us what you have notches
kids because we choose the former being

312
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
obnoxious kids

313
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,139
well what's let's analyze the Cincy
where the problem is because I could see

314
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,630
both sides of this issue

315
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,669
first question quick question to the
audience be honest if you have never

316
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:50,990
attended is 2600 beating

317
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,520
please quickly show your hands okay
that's how these the corner of this

318
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,580
audience

319
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,418
let me describe a 2600 meeting is occurs
in New York

320
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,600
we meet in the atrium in the city core
center so it's not her

321
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,070
they change the name a secret Center
while

322
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:13,540
did with it yeah I it's not quite a
shopping mall their shops around but not

323
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,980
too many it's more like this

324
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,000
food court but even that's an accurate
there's about 30 tables are 120 200

325
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,409
shares

326
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:26,080
and there is not what you would call
structure to a 2600 meeting

327
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,928
people go sit down for bring out a
laptop perhaps bring out some other

328
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:32,190
piece of equipment

329
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,860
a UNIX book whatever sit there at

330
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,620
there's no necessary identifying tag on
anyone

331
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,980
so if you've never been to one you don't
exactly spot

332
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,610
the meeting too easily this may or may
not be a good thing

333
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,810
but also as I said there's no its gender

334
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:53,480
there there's no scheduled speaker
usually despite the

335
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,640
a X rare example given by Bernie s

336
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,130
there's no said topics of discussion
they've been posted on IRC our website

337
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,730
it just exists people know that it's in
a given location on a given day for

338
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,750
given time

339
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,810
that's it and what you get out of it is
what you make of it

340
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:15,470
ideally you go you find somebody with
interesting piece of equipment in front

341
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,929
of them are interesting book

342
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:22,270
you get into a conversation this is not
good for the shy and retiring type which

343
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,929
a lot of peaks frankly are

344
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,320
South you know there's something to be
said for trying to make it into a more

345
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,780
organized the

346
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,730
activity I think maybe it's it's a bit
of a misnomer to call them meetings even

347
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,640
they're more like gatherings because as
jim says there are no real agenda

348
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,909
another summit is that do try to have
agendas and that's fine

349
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:44,940
but when we first started the meetings
was basically

350
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,280
we want to get people away from
computers and after their houses so that

351
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,800
they actually meet each other

352
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,970
and do something a bit social and I'm
you know get some oxygen

353
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,169
to be kinda and a nice thing and that's
that's sort of what we've

354
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:03,870
try to maintain but yeah it's it's some
it can be kinda disorganized can be

355
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,630
kinda chaotic and I'm not sure that's a
good thing or a bad thing

356
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,409
was it the thing i I witnessed on me at
the meetings that I was at

357
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:14,940
is also there's there's not one group
but there's like four or five

358
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,450
and I have these 45 group two or three
hate each other or

359
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:25,450
I have tried to run away from each other

360
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,910
and prelude floating the hatred or was I
think you yeah

361
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:34,580
you get people you get people following
other people around you get these crazy

362
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,210
up or at least that's what I've I've
observed you get crazy

363
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,590
should have up 0 yeah

364
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,850
fire I don't smoke any

365
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,110
guy never this

366
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,940
I lots of kids that want to learn
something about computer security or

367
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,130
something about hacking running around
asking anybody that might know can you

368
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,529
teach me how to hack work can you do
this are

369
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:06,520
and and there's there's this there's no

370
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:11,389
I there's no structure to deal with this

371
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,899
so people keep P being pushed away so
this this this

372
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:19,110
and that leads to too much social
awkwardness and it leads to

373
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,720
people not getting answers are not being
told well

374
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,340
maybe even you can be taught act to do
computer security things but maybe she

375
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,209
should learn some other things as well

376
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,309
and the end up hanging around with some
other kids have already learned a little

377
00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:32,770
bit

378
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,190
so does this not breed script kiddies
this is not

379
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,590
mean if there's if you're gonna get all
these people together and then you're

380
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,520
not going to have the

381
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,260
the should have organize this about you
to tell them or are due to receive them

382
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:50,490
in some kinda structure we tell them
well this is who we are or

383
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,950
this is what we do we'd like to be then

384
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,279
then what are 10 then what is that
that's a hierarchy

385
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,380
anarchy resent iraqis so it's kinda it's
kinda catch-22 because yet then you have

386
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,679
to be the person that knows the answers

387
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,440
and people keep telling me that's that's
the den then we would be excluding

388
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,100
people

389
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,440
or but now you're also excluding people
you're excluding the people that can't

390
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,899
do with that anymore and that just leave
because it's stupid

391
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:22,899
that's also being exclusive hey it's

392
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,800
you just never know

393
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,660
I i tender created certain extent that
have now that

394
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,620
this some other meetings I can take on a
a a I a rough

395
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,920
a mmm

396
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:46,480
mmm just I'm sorry I can hear that

397
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,670
taken arafat OVA immaturity and but

398
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,990
you know sometimes you get lucky young
people to on Andrew

399
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:58,740
who haven't who haven't yeah especially
if you're dealing with young people

400
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,100
I you can either present yourself and
and sort it should have give them a

401
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,560
structure to grow up in

402
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,270
or you can you can create this this
should have unhealthy

403
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,790
cult of personality thing you can create
people running after other people

404
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,389
I they reduce there's no different ways
of dealing with lots of young people

405
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,140
showing up

406
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,120
yeah that's that's what we try to avoid
is to create a call to personality and

407
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,450
clicks and things like that is

408
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:26,560
it's difficult because you have warring
factions in stupidity like that only

409
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,790
about that share with us

410
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,850
we feel is the meeting cuz we're not
interested in that were interested in

411
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,510
people

412
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,890
meeting each other and working it out
and if you too immature to do that

413
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,100
you really shouldn't be meeting and then
I agree with that totally

414
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,570
this may be more more American thing
then at then

415
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,610
and globally because this meetings

416
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,090
that are held around the world yeah 2010
to gatherings

417
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:53,199
and we haven't really heard much of that
sort of stuff going on in

418
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,710
any other cities like names of the other
cities like Barcelona Moscow

419
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:59,730
I've been to the meeting in London I've
been to the meeting in Prague and

420
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,910
these guys are really a you know mature
and well behaved in there

421
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,910
they're talking about various things and
listening to each other and not saying

422
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,600
they don't do that here because I see
many good meetings here but as he loves

423
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,660
the city and its

424
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,550
yeah we're proud of our culture I think
and that's that's a sad thing I just

425
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,210
enough we have the power to change that
ourselves

426
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,610
I think you do I i think you just have
to accept that that that this structured

427
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,480
the place is the venues at the meetings
themselves all is that defines with the

428
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,230
meetings are

429
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,870
and if you're not willing to make
changes or if you're not willing to have

430
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:34,970
different kinds a meeting church you're
not willing to

431
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,610
have meetings different places or
experiment with creating some kind of

432
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,980
structure that that give some kind of
message to the new people that are right

433
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,440
there

434
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,690
mean even if you have to type out three
sheets I

435
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,070
as three sheets paper just give it to
people or whatever if you

436
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,379
if you're not willing to have any kinda
structure ages let people swim

437
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,130
cycle you're here well we don't care
only know the meaning I know stuff well

438
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,010
of the meeting guidelines I told you
know what's acceptable it's not

439
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:01,760
acceptable

440
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,070
well what people should expect yeah
actually I i cant i tempted at once in a

441
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,290
in I guess it was a around 90 94 I

442
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:13,820
passed out a server a sheet of paper
with guidelines and structure a flight

443
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,320
you know the kinda topics that the a
with the

444
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,510
might be more interesting guy to discuss
and

445
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,580
ever program behavior rules have the
that the 33 station

446
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,750
far as what they're allowed to do
ironically one other roles is a

447
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,670
I no camp asset and handbills so

448
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:37,010
city yet great if the Amtrak a federal
police descended on us

449
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,400
%uh for doing just that even though
these are I was handing out these two

450
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,050
people I knew the Arctic being handed
out to strangers

451
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,120
so they tried to kick ass at the place
and that

452
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,330
I so then I went to local city paper
said you know and then they made a story

453
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,330
about it saying you know

454
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,629
I'm you know these are these are people
are showing up to to patronize some

455
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,770
other new businesses at the station to
visit Philadelphia just put all these

456
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,180
like

457
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,170
a shops and coffee shops and bookstores
and stuff its train station and

458
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,620
so thought I was around the time the to

459
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,260
a friend of mine had dat I brought to my
attention some

460
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,460
the potential surveillance of the 2600
meeting by other law enforcement

461
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,480
agencies namely the secret service

462
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,230
and week the week sort of wondered like
for these guys standing around

463
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,250
at the meetings that ins suitor just

464
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,920
state looking at is but not party the
meeting kinda thing

465
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,760
so on after one way or another I came
into possession this summer

466
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,930
surveillance photographs if somebody
says Secret Service

467
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,940
undercover agents who we believe we're
we weren't sure and I took over the next

468
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,370
meeting

469
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,510
well the local TV a to Fox

470
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,920
TV Fox Television affiliate in
philadelphia I

471
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,520
had read the newspaper article about a
month before about

472
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,850
as being harassed at the meeting and
that they showed up to do a story with

473
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,510
cameras it just so happened that I

474
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:58,030
right pictures have these a secret
service agents to that meeting and to

475
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,160
take them on the wall

476
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,260
and visit pointing them out to where
attendees saying if you see these guys

477
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:06,580
they are more than likely law
enforcement and more than likely Secret

478
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,189
Service

479
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,990
turns out I was right I'm because about
a year later

480
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,120
and my air my federal case started I

481
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,340
I got a severe at by two poration by two
secret service agents for having made

482
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,810
public I their faces on the local
television news

483
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,120
because they were operating under cover
and darlie not very well

484
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,190
fire there also picking their noses what
the hell yeah

485
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:37,310
avatar to add it to this to the to this
to the drama that these pictures had

486
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,200
them by taking their noses and looking
at professional and

487
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,120
so the end they told me have point blank
that they took a lot of heat for

488
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,540
for for that never pick their noses I
guess but for just getting the cover's

489
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,320
blown on the evening news

490
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,639
on they got even and

491
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,920
but yeah you gotta wonder about
surveillance at meetings and a federal

492
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,140
informant sand and

493
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,660
that sort of thing but I just don't go
to meetings anymore in philadelphia on

494
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,080
but that's just my choice and I think
they're in I don't think there

495
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,020
%ah its good reasons for other people
not to go I just had a bad experience

496
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,120
that

497
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,600
had nothing to with most the crowd there
on might have gone to meetings and

498
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,810
and other parts a country that work that
one like that at all

499
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:22,310
so I don't know I don't wanna think the
kind situations I ran into our

500
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,250
are gonna be that comment but I hope not
anyway

501
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,320
we we generally get a lot of mail from
people running the meetings that tell us

502
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,610
very things that happened so in a very
detailed they say where they went to eat

503
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,630
afterwards and

504
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,650
stuff early to tell but done it's nice
to hear it

505
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,950
om and we always get lotsa I'm what's a

506
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,850
people wanting to start new meetings a
too many in fact people want to start

507
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,830
meetings and small towns with fifty
people

508
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,790
and it's great but we just can't list
every single place that wants to have a

509
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,520
meeting

510
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,860
I so we pretty much say you know any
food court

511
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,930
on Friday evening First Friday the month
maybe there's a meeting there

512
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:00,460
analyst the biggest ones on the biggest
cities otherwise the whole magazine will

513
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:00,930
be

514
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:04,070
a meeting listings up but I've

515
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,310
I've heard lots of stories from people
who s who was room form partnerships and

516
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,690
companies and design things based on
people they have met at meetings

517
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,710
and I have to say I think the positive
outweighs the negative but I know there

518
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,340
is negative I know there is

519
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,720
cause some outta control people that
exist to disrupt meetings

520
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,770
I know that happens I know there are
plenty of fun

521
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,750
dark sand feds and cops and things like
that this one the reasons we meet in

522
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:30,730
public though

523
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,460
but on the other hand I gotta say that
I've I've met some really interesting PT

524
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,190
people at 2600 meetings have

525
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,400
remains %ah long term friends

526
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,560
I mean years in years on they have

527
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,790
you know Louis been able to bring other
contacts into each other's lives that

528
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,050
have really enriched our lives
tremendously

529
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,169
now that kinda chemistry and yet and
it's all kinda

530
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,350
avenues in my life that opened up in a
positive standpoint from people I met at

531
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,580
2600 meetings

532
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,050
and that truly amazing that that didn't
work out that way

533
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,460
as kids share the feds to because we
meet at the same time all around the

534
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:04,270
world

535
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:07,940
and they can't possibly send people
everywhere at once

536
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,660
and that's always been one of the
magical things about the meetings is

537
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,150
just

538
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:14,160
they think we're so well-organized that
we have

539
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,100
chapters all over the place they don't
realize just really disorganized a bunch

540
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,500
of people this meeting in malls in food
courts

541
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,820
now on the topic the mall's food court
yeah you know I don't really like this

542
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,169
place is either but

543
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:28,570
there aren't that many places that you
can meet other than street corners

544
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,510
making go to like a meeting place with
high chairs and desks and things like

545
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,860
that but the

546
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,890
I know that's the atmosphere most people
looking for maybe it is

547
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,450
I also don't want to exclude people by
having meetings in bars and things like

548
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,810
that with some people like to do

549
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,320
if you're excluding people so they're
splitting themselves are not coming but

550
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,570
nobody nobody is

551
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,520
is forbidden from coming to meetings I'm
not sure that's still the case but when

552
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,870
I was at the new york 2600 meetings

553
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:58,990
there is always two or three people that
were very very obvious criminal elements

554
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,140
the room strain my mind had nothing to
do with with hacking the spirit of

555
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,760
hacking or anything

556
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,200
they're just night that continues to
this day but the thing is we can't

557
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,500
exclude those people we can

558
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,530
why people the smart and I he not

559
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,580
because we're in a public place yes a
public place I know but

560
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,570
but isn't that then a stupid move I'm
just wondering I'm just

561
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,889
publicly wonder and I don't know I don't
know if I have the answer

562
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,860
and just that I don't want to
necessarily

563
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,250
I share my knowledge with people I

564
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,450
I don't want to have to run away from a
conversation because it's joined by

565
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,340
people that I know to be criminal well
here's the thing that I know to have no

566
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:42,690
regards whatsoever for any have the %uh
VI ideological or or social things that

567
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,200
I come from

568
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,820
and just wanna turn around and sell
whatever I tell them or

569
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,379
or use it to rip somebody offer hurt
somebody or

570
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,600
and that bothers me and i'd if if we as
a community

571
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,900
have cannot somehow

572
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,010
get rid of two or three people that that
that have nothing in common with us

573
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:06,840
think we might as well we try to get rid
of that of the of the Fed's we try to

574
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,640
get rid of the secret service we try to
make fun of them we try to

575
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,580
with we will try to give it to them from
the meetings in fact if they're at the

576
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,669
meetings we talk to them and ask them
what's the questions and they don't like

577
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,760
that but we do it anyway

578
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,060
and it doesn't sorry I miss ya this
whole thing going with

579
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,560
with the narcs the fed's that the cops
the but

580
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,600
but at the same time you're giving them
exactly what they want what they want

581
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,000
your

582
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,200
your you're giving them an atmosphere in
which you can be portrayed as hanging

583
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,310
out with a buncha criminals

584
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:39,070
you giving them the death this the from

585
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,639
the context close also give the
impression with every text

586
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,740
nothing to hide all right we're willing
to talk to anybody

587
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:50,800
a we're going to talk to the Fed's we're
going to talk to the criminals

588
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,910
we have nothing to hide what we have
this information

589
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,950
information is is the the

590
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,070

its use

591
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,470
I you can use it for good or evil I and
that is what makes the information good

592
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:08,930
or evil unto itself

593
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,440
whatever questions right thing is to
microphones ok with that

594
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,460
how I fart before the questions I just
wanna say something I'm not what Emanuel

595
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,750
said about

596
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:21,030
to getting letters from people who have
formed companies in such

597
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:25,660
if you meet someone at 2600 meeting in
form the next Google or Microsoft

please consider underwater writing %uh
the next hope conference it's only about

599
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,350
six digits for them

600
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,740
advertising it could be worth a fortune
to you

601
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,490
that start with him I have a one
relevant in sales traffic without that

602
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:43,130
I'm 5-for-5 for a logic got just
representing

603
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:47,210
Phoenix means they're a we don't need a

604
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,510
at a the food court reaction in
underground copy shops for

605
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:52,280
counter-culture cafe

606
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,410
arm we have pretty good attendance of
the like the meeting before last month

607
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,550
there's about 40 people that showed up

608
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,500
but we have had fed scummy had FBI
company that's them

609
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,290
questions even found this interesting
stuff a

610
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,820
what else from and as far as suggestions
or just the

611
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,090
another point of view are the most
successful thing that we've had

612
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,100
is that there is no elitism there's no
in finding

613
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,239
and we prioritize too high keep that out

614
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,270
and also as far as clicks in everything
we avoid that

615
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:27,219
we make sure you do that we talked
everybody we make sure to include

616
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:27,840
everybody

617
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,100
and if somebody is kinda sitting around
we know that the part meaning

618
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,190
both engaged in conversation will make
sure

619
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,000
they will find out what their interests
are will try to because we're also

620
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,250
diverse which is also helpful to

621
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,139
will have stuff to share on because yeah
know you like somebody that

622
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,230
says I know a lot but can't share it
intelligently so

623
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:52,719
straight cool something given its

624
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,810
how the first person at the second
microphone so that somebody gets left

625
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,390
out

626
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,420
okay go ahead sour

627
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:04,120
his own ozone levels

628
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:09,150
a high-level I couldn't see oh I witness
said that it was OK Go Ahead

629
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,850
I yeah I started going to the meeting
said Nam

630
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:18,400
I guess at least 90 tomb the the first
time

631
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,170
speak into the microphone I'll what I
like about the meetings is that if

632
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:24,049
you're if you're

633
00:35:24,049 --> 00:35:28,259
yeah wanna know something like how how
things work like if your computer is

634
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,869
broke and something's not working

635
00:35:29,869 --> 00:35:34,779
US someday if the 2600 meeting first he
don't go to the store and ask some

636
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:38,170
because they'll tend to give you the
runaround hackers tend to know how

637
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,619
things work and they can give you

638
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:43,369
details for there

639
00:35:43,369 --> 00:35:47,039
alright but that's not only that but
it's they can't explain to you they can

640
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,279
get the right now I G they can explain
to you how things work in a way you can

641
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:52,210
understand that's what I like about the
meetings

642
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,710
and I think that the meetings you know
that's what the meetings are for

643
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:00,580
to take get together and to ask people
you know if something isn't working and

644
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:04,600
to know some level as the coming to the
new york city meetings since about

645
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,720
nineteen ninety-two

646
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,010
familiar face and I'm you know it

647
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,950
style is being that things don't work
anymore like to use to like in the early

648
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,009
nineties like you know

649
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:18,090
I like when I first started coming to
the meeting salata I would

650
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:22,540
you know I remember L fiber-optic with
you know time i would tell people how

651
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,570
things work about telephones and

652
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,840
and I just share knowledge in I was just
11 commission but now

653
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:32,440
that the things that used to work then
not don't work now

654
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,970
you know but there's still a lot of
things to talk about I guess I mean its

655
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,670
technical but if you if your not that
technical I guess it's it's the

656
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:43,710
so okay thank you

657
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,830
next what

658
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,900
thanks

659
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,050
has got a I wanna tell you my favorite
things about my sister Venus

660
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,020
I am my favorite things is that also
local people I've ever met in my entire

661
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,590
life

662
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,410
I met twice in a minute so I had to say
thank you for that

663
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:06,580
you poor thing but

664
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,100
%ah I have to say that

665
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:15,049
I'm so many meetings out there are
really really cool meanings

666
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:18,500
I used to do a meeting a bowler and is
amazingly go on

667
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,610
field trips project together almost
everyone

668
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,530
every time someone to bring something
that they wanted to figure out her I

669
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,140
have this book it's called the check
them

670
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:30,200
gonna send phony

671
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,990
%ah 720 represent yeah um

672
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,430
and and I want to tell you what I think
about um

673
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,149
I think meeting people that have common
interest to you

674
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,620
is really awesome and in fact everywhere
I go

675
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:48,880
not just 22 tournaments every conference
I go to every meeting in

676
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,290
not united says I go to I get to meet
people like that and I like them

677
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:55,440
so it's just another avenue you can do
that

678
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,760
thought on in these other places we get
to be a little more productive

679
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,590
then we can be twice is no means
obviously it's hard to get some kind of

680
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,380
project

681
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,960
done if you're in a mall I to hum

682
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,090
on so so my favorite people that I met
you places like this

683
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,790
are people who actually work on projects
I

684
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:15,930
on

685
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:20,890
720 I am i meeting in Boulder this area
of those that sell slang term for it

686
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,450
was really fun and it died it ended
there's no more

687
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:28,380
720 meetings there hadn't been for about
two years three years

688
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,650
since I moved here and so it takes
somebody who's really in charge in a

689
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:33,320
meeting

690
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,470
to really make sure it works out we
don't have any kind of national

691
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,710
infrastructure to rely on friend we
don't have any kind of

692
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,100
organization to give us resources to do
projects

693
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,600
to make sure the meetings continue even
if somebody was away

694
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,020
fork and resources good work well
there's all kinds resources there's

695
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,390
I'm friends in the press friends
including route from his earlier top

696
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,920
now there's them there's money of course
money makes the world go around

697
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,870
if we hadn't been out some way to get
equipment I get whatever we can work on

698
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,859
projects

699
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:10,800
whatever on its cool it meetings are all
on the same Friday every

700
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,370
where around the world but we are just a
couple guys

701
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,799
sitting around and just doing a couple
things if we really wanted to have a

702
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,780
political impact

703
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,000
anywhere we can't do that you

704
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,110
hazardous a couple guys in here in
different places they don't really

705
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,160
communicate to each other

706
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,779
on I think there are other ways to get

707
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:34,530
the good things to come into 2010
earnings if we

708
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,150
has space for example the way that you
enter me

709
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,520
to work on things to do projects to
invite people and

710
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,020
to show them our space we don't have to
worry the Fed's anymore

711
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:49,180
we get respect from the press and the
public by doing what we do

712
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:52,480
instead of hanging out pronounce on

713
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,270
we can invite the criminals and we can
invite the feds and we can invite

714
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,450
everyone and and they're on our space

715
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:01,950
archer we can tell them mass than
anything you want and

716
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:08,020
having a good face in a press is a
better way to have nothing to hide

717
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:15,020
I I third

718
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,710
the

719
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:27,150
thank Michael for yes I'm not exactly
sure how unique Chicago 2010 it is by

720
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:27,630
Tom

721
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,380
we had unique situation where um we use
the meeting at Union Station downtown

722
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,220
and I did things got very hostile there
with the people that we're

723
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:40,220
that we're actually having a meeting
with so us several of us had the

724
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,800
opportunity to go to a neighbor boys and
girls fucking based essentially build

725
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,480
their efforts to their never give
structure there

726
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,099
so we moved all the meetings over there
we now have a space we can basically

727
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:53,800
meet from 7 p.m. to about five or six in
the morning typically at Friday night's

728
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:57,220
also we have few no monthly we have on
the meetings

729
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,619
the only half of the talks we do have
structure to it um

730
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:04,000
we actually the first the first meeting
the first

731
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,020
time that we have had some a top is
actually a guy from Sourcefire talk

732
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,130
about it. essence

733
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:12,390
and after never even bothered inviting
the fed's course aided by the come by

734
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,339
however %um release invited we let them
know they're there um

735
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:20,349
I think that we've we've kinda made
headway in all those areas you're saying

736
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:21,070
that word that

737
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:24,780
chat West Center itself is lacking the
meetings and

738
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:28,060
yeah I'd be happy to of some input on
some things we have done

739
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:31,270
from I mean

740
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:35,410
lastly I did say that you know we do
average from about forty

741
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,390
40 45 members every month to do so if
that does

742
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,970
kinda felt that we have brought back
from like 12 people

743
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:49,970
back at Union Station to about 40 to 50
so can happen its

744
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,640
I is doing um I N

745
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,250
bill being a resident New York I haven't
had a chance to get to

746
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,980
26 any meetings in New York City and for
that I feel really bad

747
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,720
three

748
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,870
I later %uh

749
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,690
shots bottom I agree with rob

750
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,460
I'll rock with the with AP alongside

751
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,740
my apologies um talent that that

752
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:23,950
in that you know we do have to deal with
those people

753
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:28,780
you know as he put to the criminal
elements who don't care at all about

754
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,670
trying to further knowledge trying to
further people knowing more than they

755
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,400
did before they went to a meeting

756
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,390
who just want to use the information to
get credit card numbers and and and

757
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,759
social security numbers wreak havoc in
that way

758
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,560
but also agree with jim in that you know
the information

759
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,850
has to be put out there at 16 enemies

760
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,630
and that you know someone comes in says
talking about you know

761
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:55,970
the ins and outs of like FreeBSD one
person will use that you

762
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:59,820
you know use FreeBSD in their system and
have absolutely wonderful time using

763
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,690
FreeBSD

764
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:03,850
I am the other person's going to use it

765
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:04,279
and

766
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,310
and find out exploits in it and start
screwing around and messing it up for

767
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:08,830
everyone

768
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:12,080
you know I also agree with I'll lovely
lady who is

769
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,549
in front of me who said that you know if
we had the kind of

770
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:19,420
um you know good press where we could go
and say you know what

771
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,050
these people did these things they're
not us cuz

772
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:28,260
honestly as technology has evolved so
have we were no longer just simply

773
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,200
hackers now we're network security
enthusiasts hard wouldn't do

774
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,060
hardware through this computer
enthusiasts so you know

775
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,560
hackers is becoming a bit of an archaic
term to describe

776
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,230
who we are you know and as such

777
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,340
you know the structure the meetings does
need to change you know I think that

778
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,270
both at the meeting level and also at
the at the highest level

779
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:55,460
you know using utilizing the website to
be able to you know

780
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:59,320
to better organize things at that level
using the meetings themselves you know

781
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,140
like when bernie had bell-atlantic
people.com you are not making that

782
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,100
so structured and so organize that we
start calling attention to ourselves

783
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,510
you know before we're ready to save
we're not like this

784
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:15,140
anymore but you know in such a way that

785
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:19,650
we'll invite people people who are kinda
interest in computers like

786
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:23,430
I am but never really had a at a Reno

787
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,000
or form to enter mmm okay yeah

788
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,410
79 centimeter it that way to get if I
think says efforts

789
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:36,149
got a lot of people like that so try to
make a comment as quickly as possible

790
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,250
and then the backup

791
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,320
okay I actually have a question I'll

792
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,250
suppose that a decision is made that you
want to change the format at meetings

793
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:46,470
that you want to make the FB is more
restrictive

794
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:50,530
what is your ultimate recourse I mean
the only thing you can really do is

795
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,030
delist the meeting and the second thing
is say that

796
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,220
you know you such a make these changes

797
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:00,870
who's involved in the decision making
process is it just where you know you

798
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:01,950
may also well

799
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:04,990
these are the guidelines is how it is
and if you don't like it would be

800
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,990
listing the meeting so

801
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,810
as one answer that two part question

802
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,540
well that's that's definitely have a %uh
a problem that we're facing all the time

803
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:14,440
we don't take too much control

804
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,960
up from a place that we're not even
there are you know we don't know what

805
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,170
goes on in Sioux City

806
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,100
maybe the the way they structure
meetings their works differently that

807
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,130
doesn't Boston

808
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,760
we like leave it up to the individual
group to do this and leave it as open as

809
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,280
possible I i hear all the

810
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,300
all the problems that can arise from
having it to the

811
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:38,220
to open a structure I like to think that
the meetings themselves are kind of like

812
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,100
the first contact that you have with
people from there

813
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,480
you can take the next step and say okay
we want to do a project with you

814
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,170
made us at a space that we have and
let's build something together

815
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:53,650
but I don't want to create something
where there's a I

816
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,530
a national controlling body someplace s
remote from the actual location where

817
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,690
you guys are working

818
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,930
I think there's no substitute for you
doing that yourselves yes I must come

819
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,890
yeah hun wanna the best things that I
think you can do if you have

820
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,290
like more than eight people showing up
it up in the 2600 meeting

821
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:18,570
is to form a non-profit organization
among the people that you wanna hang out

822
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,020
with

823
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,140
in the group and that's gonna cost about
200 bucks in most states

824
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,790
and you can use that to take donations
in all sorts of things and

825
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:31,279
get a lab space and all sorts North
Carolina $3,600 just

826
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,550
got started allowed and %uh its

827
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,130
it's like at 12 by 12 room with the t1
line

828
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:44,490
some here any huge beer but um nonprofit
organizations are a great way to build

829
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,930
your meeting and to build in the
direction you want to go

830
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:52,899
because the 2600 meeting is a great
starting place it's a great Nexus

831
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:58,380
by it eat changing it to fit your needs
doesn't necessarily work because it's no

832
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,810
longer 2600 beating

833
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,210
by you can do the second or third Friday
of the month

834
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,770
as your nonprofit group for something
else wary

835
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:10,119
you get the people the you want to get
together together

836
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:14,780
did you what you want to do okay I'm
Paname from Ann Arbor just want to point

837
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:17,369
out that I think rob has some good
points because

838
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:21,400
I think a meeting in food court some
places that are so plastic and

839
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,830
consumer-oriented

840
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,410
%ah and also serve youth oriented

841
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,009
in a certain way can be limiting
inserted who

842
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:34,130
the they've you limit the perception of
us

843
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:39,460
to the outside world as being the young
kids that hang out at the mall and blah

844
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,900
blah blah blah blah so I think

845
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,030
moving them or allowing people to think
about other places are encouraging them

846
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:46,330
off

847
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:50,220
might be interested in you do have that
that power i mean that people at the

848
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,859
meetings are the ones who pick the place
we don't tell people they meet in

849
00:47:52,859 --> 00:47:54,210
football I

850
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:57,970
but it's become sort of unspoken rule

851
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:01,740
I think over a hundred no I i disagree
with that i I would love it if everybody

852
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,520
moves out at the food court Stoli

853
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,380
but that we need to find better place
was there may be a good thing might be

854
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,470
for people to start is having
discussions a

855
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:14,140
impasse those ideas on to other groups I
think I hope to god it is is is perfect

856
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,940
I think that's exactly the solution

857
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,430
so maybe talking that's mean meeting its
about different ways might begin

858
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:25,660
fight thank you on the back on a I want
to quickly

859
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:28,680
just second half the

860
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,118
the guy before this gentleman over here
I'm

861
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:35,150
said something about forming a separate
meeting on the second row the third

862
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,440
Friday of the month

863
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,680
and then hanging out with the people
that you wanna hang out with

864
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,470
which to me sounds just like an
institutionalized former what I see

865
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,670
happening here in New York

866
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,640
which group of people running away in
trying to shove way the other kids they

867
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,470
keep showing up

868
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:53,350
which is

869
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,790
I'm not saying that's wrong I'm just
saying it's it's it's a consequence of

870
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:57,630
what's happening

871
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:02,260
and now I'm not sure I'm not sure that
means anything I'm saying it's an

872
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:04,570
institutionalized for me the same thing

873
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:07,940
for this there's no real different from
my for saying these guys are criminal

874
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,350
elements as get away from them

875
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:13,390
we know what we're doing they don't
what's get the negative influence out

876
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:16,859
honey you meet people at a meeting
you're free to socialize with them

877
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,950
further later on and do things and

878
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:22,800
well that we provide not not mine on a
German model where

879
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,830
the germans just have a club guys can we
have a little bit more quieter keep it

880
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:29,940
discussion a little bit more centralized

881
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,830
scares me shut off access

882
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:38,400
sorry I'm really have got two minutes so
let's wrap it up as

883
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,570
the Germans have a club in the Germans
are are it's not like anybody can just

884
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:46,330
come by and and and and take over the
club for be part of the club it's more

885
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:46,750
often

886
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:51,830
a very a system a fitting in a system of
us who we want to be part of the club

887
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,009
but not be part of the club

888
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:56,590
and here the the same mechanism is
needed

889
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:59,820
and it's somehow implicitly created

890
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:03,850
which leads to lots of people running
away from other people a lot so awkward

891
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:04,400
scenes

892
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:08,230
mean I've been together with you running
away from other parts of the meeting

893
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:11,510
jumping on subway trains jumping
turnstiles getting

894
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,850
I mean it's the same mechanism it's just
a more immature we have getting to it

895
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:22,850
insulate attics running away from I know
I points let's try and get two more and

896
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,560
chutzpah class first microsatellite
microphone which South act like a fun

897
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,250
than the front that's really all we have
time for sorry I

898
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,440
spending time girls I'm why the people

902
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:47,010
I'm whether people who want to his first
2600 meeting I last year after ho

903
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,329
from

904
00:50:50,329 --> 00:50:54,339
I been in the community for a while it's
just I avoided me thanks

905
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:58,339
and so I decided that last year I
finally got with my 600 meeting

906
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:01,630
from idea I have to agree with you

907
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:04,660
on that I did feel a bit uncomfortable
I'm

908
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:08,178
I'm okay with the meeting place but it
was more

909
00:51:08,179 --> 00:51:10,700
there was a a

910
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,010
kinda but class system going online

911
00:51:14,010 --> 00:51:18,360
hidden within the meaning any manual
himself told me to get off my ass and

912
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,180
walk around the room

913
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,570
I tried it meets meet people so I did I
still

914
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:26,650
felt a little uncomfortable all this

915
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:30,260
I'm 32 years old and I still felt a
little uncomfortable coming up for the

916
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:32,620
first time and

917
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,000
%ah something that people always turn me
off a little bit is there anyway

918
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,990
I have read the guidelines first for
showing up to there any other way

919
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:45,110
to suggest we can make it a little bit
more easier for newcomers

920
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:49,240
people sorry if this this really is far
as I can see no way to make it

921
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,010
real easy for new covers because in any
social situation

922
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:56,620
familiarity breeds familiarity unlike
her

923
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:01,560
the saying goes the more you show up the
more you accept that even if you are

924
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:04,779
off in a corner just because people see
your face more often

925
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,400
they'll get used to you and your more
accepted you're more likely to get talk

926
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,850
through

927
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,140
the only reason I talk to anybody in my
first the meeting was because I had

928
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,470
something that a manual on third and
vice versa

929
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:19,700
but other than that just keep showing up

930
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,340
sooner or later it will work I know that
sounds like a lame advice but it's true

931
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,230
okay we'll have time for one more is
going to be if yeah I've been on the

932
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:29,070
2600

933
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:34,360
meetings now since 1999 all what a great
met a lot of great people there

934
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:37,750

935
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,510

people here know me
