1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:04,480
and I think you can do that I think this
group has the power to be calm

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,089
a virtual police force in and police
force is not the right word consumer

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:14,349
what's exact alright we're rolling okay
so the Mossad

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:17,710
there is a Mossad agent here

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,490
wait a minute

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,490
I thought you only drink when I said
open source for well

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:36,960
you know Peter Drucker talks about what
are called mono maniacs and and Rob who

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,699
is the other

9
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:42,108
major actor leader was telling me he has
a 32 for your attention span will have a

10
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,620
25 your attention span

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,928
on in I've got to seven years to go

12
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:52,800
so you'll hear open source again arm

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,890
but about the Mossad they're very good
in a narrow area

14
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,210
they're not as global a CIA but CA is
more

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,729
bureaucratic any anyone trying work out
of an embassy is

16
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,399
stupid arm in

17
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:12,270
most side has one big thing going for
which is that most Jews consider

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,079
themselves Jews first and citizen second
and

19
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,860
there's a term for them it's called
Seoni in shoes will be

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,920
quite happy to accommodate the Mossad
with intelligence on their

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,189
coworkers with safe houses with

22
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,780
other accommodations thinking they're
being loyal to Israel

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:38,170
and not tell the FBI now the Mossad his
run operations in the United States

24
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,689
across America they had a whole bunch of
art students

25
00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:44,979
basically running scare of operations on
the Drug Enforcement Administration

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,579
there is credible evidence that the most
side is using drugs

27
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:53,000
into america as a means of financing
itself off budget

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,850
okay now hi would like to have a really
strong counterintelligence service I

29
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,130
will be a class guy

30
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,229
when I catch when the shit hits the get
a first class seat on the town

31
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:08,300
no notice but I think that the Mossad
the

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,700
Chinese the germans even the French for
christ sake

33
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,090
are making fools of us in the FBI is
clueless

34
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,769
the FBI has no fucking idea what's going
on in this country

35
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:24,569
in that said all right sir were on

36
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,120
the first thing I'd like to ask is to
inquire

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,099
if you're familiar with any George
sources literature on globalization

38
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,790
on international affairs I've read in
favorably reviewed a couple of his books

39
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,950
okay I'd also like to for

40
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,370
you to comment on specifically some love
his suggestions on

41
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,920
the modifications love the international
economic

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,049
organizations and their usage the
specific modifications

43
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,590
love the use of Special Drawing Rights
to increase both the

44
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,709
amount of foreign aid given as well as
way it's directed towards it

45
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,680
to make both make it more effective as
well as disconnected from

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,010
its current usage as to support you
local concerns

47
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,620
and how you see that as where you see

48
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,450
of the direction for nature take and the
connection

49
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,930
between your suggestions for the
modification have

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,590
intelligence-gathering when I finish
speaking you'll all have master's degree

51
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,019
in international economics

52
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,379
good alright so this is a smart guy

53
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:35,200
I respect him very much arm let me start
by saying

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,860
that jeffrey sachs is written a good
book called the end of poverty

55
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,819
he's a Columbia University he's an
adviser to the United Nations and he's a

56
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:47,420
he's really focused on the end of
extreme poverty rather than all poverty

57
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,360
but Jeffrey Sachs is basically said that
develop

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,670
developmental economics are

59
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,790
completely different from the economics
at the International Monetary Fund and

60
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,548
the World Trade administration iPhone

61
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,209
on i'ma big believer in in

62
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,549
the concept of in moral capitalism you
have william greider spoke the souls

63
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:14,049
capitalism creating a path to moral
economy

64
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,978
you have John Perkins on you know I have
to talk later

65
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:23,258
you have John Perkins on Confessions of
an economic hit man

66
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:26,490
the bottom line here is that

67
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,580
the deck is stacked not only against

68
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,349
other countries outside the GATT but
against the public's love those

69
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,340
countries in our own country

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,729
on the whole system is screwed up

71
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,800
just like the United States government
screwed up

72
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,100
and I don't have any easy answers for
you other than this

73
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,289
I have two solutions in mind neither one
of which is

74
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:56,400
being listened to by anyone in power
might conceivably implement them so

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,220
don't think I'm putting on airs number
one is I believe we need to use Wiki

76
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,610
Kalkan other forms

77
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,680
love actually posting the budget the
real budget

78
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,069
not the false budget that the government
presents government doesn't show you

79
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:15,180
the real close iraq it doesn't show you
the real close to the amputees the real

80
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,000
close

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,910
of lifetime disability and so forth we
need to actually connect the budget to

82
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,910
reality

83
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,240
that's number one because if you connect
the budget to reality you'll find

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,169
that we are basically creating slave
workers

85
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,680
rather than thinkers as a general
proposition across the economy this is

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,470
lunacy

87
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,810
in the information age on

88
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:44,610
the other thought that I have is that we
need to take away

89
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,729
the on accountability of corporations

90
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:52,469
in we need to restore the concept
managers being accountable for the

91
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,630
decisions in their actions right now

92
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,639
we have too many lawyers in america we
have

93
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,220
we have too many fails that high people

94
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,509
and the last thing they'll see on this
is that I absolutely believe that CK

95
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:08,009
Prahalad should get a Nobel Peace Prize

96
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,199
for his book on the fortune at the
bottom of the pyramid

97
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,509
he talks about how capitalism today is
focused on

98
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:17,720
the top billion who have a

99
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,569
net disposable income above $1 trillion
a year and these are the people

100
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,150
mean on I'm really pissed off at my kids
grandparents we have ninety

101
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,750
these in our house something seriously
wrong with that

102
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,819
on but

103
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:35,740
this is this is a an economy that is
built for people who can afford to have

104
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,340
disposable refrigerators

105
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,720
well CK Prahalad has pointed out that
the

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,430
5 sure five million people the bottom
the permit have a four trillion dollar

107
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,560
year net disposable income but the bike
different things

108
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,819
their refrigerator in Africa cost two
dollars

109
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,870
and it consists of a ceramic pot inside
of another ceramic pot with an air

110
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,840
filter barry

111
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,910
with an air gap buried in the ground
which will keep

112
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,120
meat fresh for five days it's a
completely different approach

113
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,759
I earnestly believe that we are within
three deer

114
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,740
37 years just as a wild ass guess we're
within three to seven years

115
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,000
starting to get it and starting to show
through selective purchasing or non

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,210
purchasing

117
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,759
and through vocal demand are connected
by the internet and so forth

118
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,229
arm what it boils down to is

119
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:34,490
the world is an aquarium and I'm
reminded of that story where you put

120
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,280
you know you drop on rat one into the
criminal eventually they start eating

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,430
each other

122
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,099
911 was the cesspool reaching your nose

123
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:46,500
on and so we have to take all this
seriously iight

124
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,860
sorry if that doesn't answer your
question follow

125
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,129
yeah thanks okay next sir

126
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:59,389
have couple make live to the maker for
the okay

127
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,069
I had a couple things um one was

128
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:07,069
I've read articles recently about a
growing trend basically

129
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:11,970
people at home were just small local
organizations

130
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,870
people who go online and browse
arabic-language web forums and just

131
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,849
take that information and submit it to
the CIA or to the FBI

132
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:25,009
and up and there have been no arrests
based on information supplied by these

133
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,120
people

134
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,319
um what is your opinion on this trend

135
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,610
well first off I think that those
success stories are largely self

136
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,960
promotion by SETI

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,090
the woman who wrote terrorist hunter:
under the name anonymous

138
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:45,780
she was trained by Steve Emerson are the
reality is that neither the FBI

139
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:51,510
nor the CIA are equipped to act on
citizen inputs

140
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,490
and nine out of 10 times any kind of
lead from any citizen is going to be

141
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,930
discarded

142
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:02,810
just like that throughout to walk ins
the system is not bill to the network

143
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,040
the system is built to be a bunker

144
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,050
that takes in secrets in puts out very
direct stove pipes the system is not

145
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:15,540
bill to be comprehensive for example

146
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,040
on the so-called concept of intelligence
sharing

147
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,969
with the state's the Department of
Homeland Security NCAA national

148
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,350
television simplemente shin and you
can't blame see i mean they're only

149
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,960
they're they're they're less than $2
billion three billion out of the sixty

150
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,020
billion okay

151
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,410
there the runt in this whole thing
rumsfeld the sitting on 85 percent of

152
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,890
the intelligence budget

153
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,819
arm but for states to get

154
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,280
intelligence what's happening is they're
building a cement bunker they're running

155
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,770
all the steel pipes and everything okay
fine

156
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,030
five or six people can be cleared to
read our precious gems

157
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,339
but they have to come from wherever they
are to this cement bunker

158
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,680
they have to sign in they have to read
it they can take make a copy they can't

159
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,510
make notes

160
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,930
X sign out that's how we're going to
share intelligence

161
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,330
that's just moronic K

162
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,450
so I let me let me segue that because
you raise an important point

163
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,630
the whole concept the Citizen
intelligence and I dresses in my second

164
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,990
book the new craft intelligence and the
subtitle my second book

165
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,110
was public person on political and
endless you think I'm trying to sell my

166
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,990
books if you really wanna PDF copy of my
books

167
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,110
there on my website for free arm

168
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,850
but I recommend you buying from Amazon
because they're much more fun

169
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:35,080
on I mean they're really there they're
nice to touch the feeling mark-up and

170
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
everything

171
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,010
arm I don't make money on the set
publish them myself San

172
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,420
give away half alone on

173
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,550
the concept the Citizen intelligence is
very very important because what icy out

174
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:53,450
in the world what I learned on the
Office of Information Technology at CIA

175
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:58,600
when I was on rotational tour is that
it's the data entry problem

176
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,090
that breaks governments and you solve
that problem by creating a network

177
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,760
were end users generate the content
posted content structure the content and

178
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,040
the content

179
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,880
and then the content can be shared in
the CIA

180
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,650
is not there they are as John Gary
Barlow

181
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:23,040
wrote in forbes long ago they are the
last vestige of the Soviet Gulag

182
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,300
okay with respect to death computers and
phones and so forth therein the Stone

183
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,130
Age

184
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,960
on so where I think I wanna go with this
is creating a public intelligence

185
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,330
network

186
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,620
that gets to the point where I was with
the Aspen brown Commission which is

187
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,340
within six phone calls I wax the
intelligence community's ass

188
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,270
in in they trying to ignore that in fact
I just right they keep saying we can we

189
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,110
should drink to Wikipedia

190
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,390
arm I just tried to fix the leaky PD
open source intelligence

191
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:55,240
and I hit the CIA morons they wanted to
pretend that the history open source

192
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,500
intelligence started

193
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,960
on the 5th December with the appointment
of sergeant Lehr teens

194
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,340
as the assistant deputy director
National Intelligence from source

195
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,560
and I went in there and I put in the
history from 1988

196
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,260
forward and CIA comes in and delete

197
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,439
okay hello

198
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,670
so I said fuck yes in the created a
table of contents from my website

199
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,819
because I realize nobody was taking into
my web sites and I've created a dummies

200
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,890
guide to open source intelligence

201
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,970
hope you guys all get drunk on the
speech arm

202
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,250
in the you know its its it's gonna
happen

203
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,730
it's gonna happen citizen intelligence
is very important and I love my concept

204
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,970
of a 119 number and 114 number

205
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,030
on with the 119 number going to every
cell phone within a one-mile radius of

206
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,680
whatever you see that's a threat

207
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,220
the 114 number goes to a community
Intelligence Center North

208
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,920
325 people are sending in the same
information about a guy taking pictures

209
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,200
with nuclear plant

210
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,340
as my 17-year-old would say that's a
clue

211
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:03,340
has anyone identified my son yah alright
where easy

212
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,160
yes it is

213
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,510
alright I promised him that he was
identified I would ask miss anything and

214
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,439
I wouldn't say anything about him

215
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:18,300
you out there

216
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,300
you alright

217
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,769
her

218
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:35,769
it tell me about his body jewelry you
got it

219
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,730
now what should the price be how about
having

220
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:45,179
you give me your address and I'll send
you whichever one of my books you want

221
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,129
alright

222
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:51,829
he's been no I'm so proud of him and I'm
proud to you guys

223
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:55,100
I mean in many ways I feel that over the
years I've earned

224
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,739
the opportunity to bring my son here and

225
00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:03,709
and I think that he's found the kindred
spirit among you all he's been very shy

226
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:04,959
about talking to people

227
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,420
and I think that's a good thing another
question sir

228
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,679
um yes I you mentioned earlier the book
Confessions of an economic hit man but

229
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,629
I'm curious on what you think of the
actual accuracy of the story that that

230
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:18,509
book presents

231
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,980
it so that's a good question on I don't
think the guy worked for NSA NSA doesn't

232
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,069
do that kinda stuff

233
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:29,769
I think there are is at my son back
there are you willing to come up here in

234
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:30,119
just

235
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:34,889
I want I promise I won't say a word but
I think that i'd in fact that like

236
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:35,959
someone take a picture

237
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,959
the two of us here

238
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,120
who would have thought

239
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,120
I have one normal child

240
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,029

00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,220
and and he has my brains in his mother's
common sense

long here who never comes out of his

are good kids with a great mother on

253
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:01,709
question um was about L Perkins

254
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:06,830
I think I think Perkins is no more than
20 percent fiction

255
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,050
on and I think that the eighty percent

256
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,000
that is substance is very real for
example I am

257
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,190
very impressed by the stories he tells
about

258
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,260
corporations using was a or pseudo

259
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,870
religious organizations to basically

260
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,779
are in fact native populations with
diarrhea and get them to move of

261
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,279
mountains that have a lot of gold

262
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,510
and things like that on I'm not

263
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,089
given to conspiracy theories I am given
to where there's smoke there's fire

264
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:42,040
on and I i have reviewed Perkins book on
Amazon and I would give it

265
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,860
easily in eighty percent credibility
rating but no in a sage is not hire

266
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,440
people

267
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,279
like that to go do things one just one
more thing you mentioned operation you

268
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,130
mentioned operation Northwoods

269
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:59,180
an operation one nor North Point yeah
and

270
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,940
um you mentioned something about the
plan including killing Americans

271
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,650
Jim Samford has the complete copy of
that declassify plan in the back in his

272
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:08,310
book

273
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,510
pretext for war lol I'm just

274
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:17,270
as far as I've seen so far included
basically preserving the lives of all

275
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:17,939
involves

276
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,990
no lives were supposed to be killed
really

277
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,630
I don't think night that's that's that's
fine if thats

278
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,829
what you think but and its that's the
way it is but I don't think that's the

279
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,428
way

280
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:32,460
it was actually intended it was intended
to kill enough people in a gruesome

281
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,960
enough way as to arouse the American
passion allow

282
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,350
arm allow america to go to war

283
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,909
what is your opinion on this change who

284
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,750
loose change don't know it the

285
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,170
documentary haven't seen can't see
everything

keep an eye out for it yes sir

287
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,240

moment what do you think

289

00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,570
in the Middle East and how they're
investing their money

291
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,250

countries right and I the Prince's you

no producing it putting it back into the
people too quick answers 1

294
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,340
all of those governments

295

are run by elites that are screwing
their people the Saudi Arabian

296
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,800

00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:13,270
a there's actually kidnapping ring that
will deliver

309
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,450
movie star looks by name on in

310
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,840
and people stupid enough to go to a
so-called movie audition by themselves

311
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,709
or are very prime to be kidnapped

312
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:28,450
when when the UN is talking about other
atrocities are talking about

313
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:32,040
%uh they're talking about trading women
and children

314
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,639
including perversions with children and
they're talking about kidnapping for

315
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
body parts in kidnapping

316
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,159
for for specified sacks are

317
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,240
I think all these governments are
completely corrupt

318
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,260
I would refer you to a book by
ambassador Palmer called the real

319
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,570
axis of evil if I were got her fire
advising the president I would have an

320
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,649
Under Secretary of State for democracy

321
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,830
with two assistant secretaries one for
the guys had agreed to a five-year

322
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,678
buyout

323
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,770
forty-four dictators and one for the
ones who don't

324
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:03,830
and I would have an undersecretary of
defense for peace

325
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,830
what a concept now theoretically Defense
directive

326
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,070
3,000 makes peace equally important as
war but we know that's not true

327
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:17,080
because you don't profit from peace at
least the the war profiteers don't

328
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,080
the second comment I would make you is
that for all over israel's

329
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:27,649
faults I still condemn the Arab nations
for failing to provide Palestinians with

330
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,409
land

331
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:33,550
passports rights and support they simply
haven't done

332
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,550
I get I guess from trying to go with
this to all my thoughts on

333
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:40,780
are what he thinks effects will be what
do I think what some the effects will be

334
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,389
I mean if what they got their shit
together know if

335
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:47,919
if they run out of their profits where
you know work where

336
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,980
running into crisis with oil 10 min
after recent election

337
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,500
and where do you think that will go up
number one

338
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,669
we're running out of oil because thirty
years ago we decided not to give a shit

339
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:01,990
at the policy level

340
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:05,450
there are lotsa solutions for oil but
one of them is not

341
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,950
tar sands Canada right now is to be
something really stupid

342
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,110
they are pumping water they don't have

343
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,200
to get oil scenes okay so they're doing
a water oil trade of which is really

344
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
stupid

345
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,179
on I don't wanna be sanguine about this

346
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,020
and I agree with henry kissinger when he
says africa is a litmus test for

347
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,800
american foreign policy

348
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:33,179
arm I believe that nature has a way of
curing many ills

349
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,830
their 59 plagues around the world one of
them is gonna hit the arabs at some

350
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,710
point

351
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,960
if I would God I would say we're going
to be free in Arabic oil

352
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,300
and we're gonna make nice with who chose
this

353
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,220
you know show this is building a
pipeline

354
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,150
from Venezuela to come in which is a
refinery town I live there my dad was in

355
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,640
a village

356
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,310
here and that pumps crude oil and then
he's gonna pump refined oil to the west

357
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,010
coast

358
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,658
cartagena completely bypassed the Panama
Canal and shine is basically gonna suck

359
00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:03,970
Venezuela dry

360
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,220
at the same time that populates Latin
America

361
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,310
okay the world is turning Chinese russia
is going to be Chinese within

362
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:14,720
twenty to forty years they're just Brady

363
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,400
okay we have no strategy for this we
have absolutely no strategy

364
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,940
on I think it all comes down to getting
a grip on reality

365
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,270
United States pass to understand the
real world in all these languages with

366
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,810
historical depth

367
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,690
with cultural sophistication bring it on

368
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,800
you know holy shit employees I think
george bush has issues with the

369
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,940
sexuality

370
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,000
and of and I think he is

371
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,300
belligerent in a bully in part because
he's not all man

372
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,760
arm you heard it here first or maybe
didn't hear it first

373
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:55,350
okay on

374
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:58,480
in we elected the asl ok

375
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,600
well art all right you're absolutely
right we did not elect

376
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,150
we let him steal the election your
absolutely correct

377
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:09,450
okay and I will never forgive al gore
for not having the balls

378
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,840
to listen the grad pabst who told him

379
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,030
before it all came to pass what was
going to happen

380
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:19,370
great pass broke this story before
Election Day

381
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:22,500
and gore just didn't wanna listen thank
you

382
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,000
you best I can do yes sir

383
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,710
I had heard reports from iraq

384
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,460
that the IED were set off by cell phones

385
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,639
that's correct to have a confirmation on
that yes absolutely

386
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:43,560
0 fact on my website has a report that
we did on IED's and cell phone that

387
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,480
nation

388
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,429
one of the interesting things is the
chinese are producing millions and

389
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:49,179
millions or call long-range

390
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,020
base station cell phones so for example
a guy who has a forty-acre 400-acre

391
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,970
range

392
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,960
can set up a base station title landline
and have all kinds a cell phones

393
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
there are also no cell phones & in many
airplanes

394
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,669
drones why don't day program the cell
phone towers a cell phone systems

395
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:12,139
just randomly rain all the phones

396
00:24:12,139 --> 00:24:15,659
in some random pattern totally

397
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:22,370
discourage sector

398
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,820
aren't we we we we actually did this in
beirut

399
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,000
long ago the Marine Corps got a special
team that would go through it would

400
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,060
basically set off bombs while they were
being made

401
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,070
it was lotsa fun

402
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,408
I think your idea is a good one one of
the problems that were encountering

403
00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:44,760
is that and the Pakistanis are the very
best that this

404
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,810
what they do is they jam or shut off all
cell phone coverage along the route

405
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,270
of President Bashar who knows who's
doing this and why

406
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,840
on you know it's it certainly great idea

407
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,830
arm I don't know for doing it or not
love

408
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,270
we we haven't figured out how to do
insurgency me

409
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,870
you don't do insurgency in convoys with
bulletproof vests and

410
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,919
and sunglasses you do it with

411
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,510
water trucks and medicine and food and
working electricity

412
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,510
and the fact that electricity doesn't
work in beirut today tells me that

413
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,320
george bush doesn't give a shit

414
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:30,320
about stabilizing Iraq okay

415
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,200
question for you is 0 where do you feel
the UN

416
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,330
is in this situation on on global
politics and where should the

417
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:47,639
are the UN is as close as we get to an
effective international organization it

418
00:25:47,639 --> 00:25:50,700
has some pathological deficiencies

419
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,790
the first pathological deficiency is it
doesn't have a clue on how to do

420
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,408
decision support

421
00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,380
and Louise for scheck the Canadian
deputy minister of defense who became

422
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,290
the deputy secretary-general that was
won over priorities

423
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,428
she still hasn't solved it the bar he me
report was a very important report and

424
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,260
decision support making the yuan
affective

425
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,860
major-general come near my friend I'm
going to spend a couple weeks in the

426
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,649
Congo in the g2 tent

427
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:18,870
to see what the UN has at the bottom the
tent

428
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:24,050
arm after the elections in September he
did his best to move intelligence for

429
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,230
right now thank you right now the UN

430
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:31,389
lacks intelligence in all senses of the
word

431
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:35,200
all the UN has two other major flaws

432
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,880
the first major flaw is that its people
have become accustomed to a life of

433
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,909
luxury

434
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:46,030
on at the headquarters level and they
have become accustomed to using students

435
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:47,379
who like to party

436
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:52,880
as volunteers in the field as well as
detailees from Nigeria who don't read or

437
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,250
drive a truck or whatever ambassador row

438
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,690
oakley is that a good book on than
policing the New World Disorder

439
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:01,639
something like that he talks about these
issues

440
00:27:01,639 --> 00:27:07,350
the third problem that we have is at the
united nations is like Wikipedia is

441
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:12,300
the majority of morons rule are except
for the security council which has

442
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,010
on inappropriate veto power are so I
think there's some things that need to

443
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,750
be changed there but I would be the
first to say

444
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,540
god help me John Bolton might be the
anima they need

445
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:31,540
I love and to I think the UN is all
we've got we need to make it work

446
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,560
a om I was wondering here

447
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,870
al Qaeda but I was wondering

448
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,750
up

449
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,639
now just you don't have to movie just
touch it I was wondering if you could

450
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,780
talk a little about

451
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,668
%uh the white power militias in this
country oh yes

452
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:59,480
I i heard something on Democracy Now yes
searching for weapons of mass

453
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,850
destruction

454
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:05,740
and I didn't hear that hun any other
news source but that they did find them

455
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,090
welcoming American enlisted men will
sell anything to anyone

456
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,010
on which is why we're him urging
M-sixteens

457
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,620
National Guard armories and stuff like
that on

458
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,389
the neo-nazis in america have discovered
you know the

459
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:25,409
the the enemy of my enemy is my friend

460
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:29,570
and so there are I think some very
destructive tendencies

461
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:33,980
the islamic groundless to use white
neo-nazis discover and so forth

462
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,010
in and they're forming some alliances I
don't have

463
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,179
a lot a direct information on this but I
have heard an extremely good lecture by

464
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,570
Tom Copeland you might try Google

465
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,240
if they may even be on my website are
but Tom Copeland from LexisNexis is done

466
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,620
an excellent lecture

467
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,840
on ties between X white extremists the
United States

468
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,980
and enemies the United States love
arabic

469
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,200
or Islamic origin arm the second thing I
would say to other things one

470
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,950
the oklahoma city bombing was a much
larger network both coconspirators the

471
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,720
US government wants you to know

472
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,950
my opinion on and to

473
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:16,760
I gave late nineteen speeches across the
country in the aftermath of that for the

474
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,230
american

475
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,710
Foreign Relations Committee AFC or
something in I was stunned to find that

476
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,580
there are an awful lot of Americans that
really hate our government

477
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,260
arm and these are reasonable
middle-class

478
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,280
medical loyal I mean I don't talk to
anybody above you know middle class or

479
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,740
below middle class

480
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,210
and and these are people at a very
reasonable insane and they think the

481
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,409
federal government is

482
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:46,649
is a really big part of the problem and
I think libertarians are gaining ground

483
00:29:46,649 --> 00:29:51,179
west to the Mississippi arm and I
wouldn't go so far as to say that

484
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:55,399
Joe Garo whose wonderful book nine
nations in North America

485
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:58,820
set the stage for us fragmenting into
nine nations

486
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,870
but I do believe that there is a
tendency in the world

487
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:06,130
to go back toward fragmentation along
logical regional

488
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,290
are lines and I agree with with Ralph
Peters

489
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,408
we need to reconstruct African Arabia

490
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:16,639
along ethnic and tribal lines rather
than colonial lines that were

491
00:30:16,639 --> 00:30:19,980
arbitrarily set

492
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,870
can I ask for more yessir of course I
have nothing to do between now and 10 in

493
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,260
the morning actually between now and
eight in the morning

494
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:30,629
I was wondering %uh if you support
Dennis Kucinich's

495
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:33,970
proposition to establish department for
peace

496
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,560
the short answer is yes but

497
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,250
that is a cop-out what he really needs
to do

498
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,169
is make the Department of State
Department of Defense and the Department

499
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:48,530
of Justice and the rest for the
government work

500
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,120
as they're supposed to right now in Iraq
the only people doing their job for the

501
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,520
troops that are dying in bleeding every
day

502
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,700
the rest to the US government is out to
lunch

503
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,270
thanks

504
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:11,450
what which %uh viewpoint on Fox News

505
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,399
I i actually tune in to Fox News

506
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:18,730
I was banned from Fox News after I said
we're not fighting

507
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:22,980
global War on Terror that's just a
pretext they didn't like that

508
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,389
arm Fox News in this

509
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:29,990
and culture

510
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,980
the actually this is what book are
reviewed called strategery

511
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,320
on um and I'll tell you what the idiocy

512
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:44,480
love the ideological right has to be
seen and felt to be believed

513
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,780
I mean these people are nuts arm

514
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,379
in I'm just absolutely stunning I mean
there's a there's a major coalition

515
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,770
between

516
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,799
are the Jews in the evangelical
Christians they've actually got a

517
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:59,690
multimillion-dollar program to grow the
perfect readcasts

518
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,120
which is like the signal that shits
gonna happen

519
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,200
arm and i'm absolutely convinced there's
a branch in the Mossad they've done this

520
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,659
twice now

521
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:12,130
in at the very last minute a little
white here is appearing on absolutely

522
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,870
convinced there's a TMO side branch

523
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:19,690
that is is responsible for taking
chlorine 21 here on this calf

524
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,830
right before it gets too where we need
to be

525
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,360
you know these people lunatics

526
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,730
and there in power

527
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,090
you mentioned the importance of citizen
intelligence

528
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:39,159
and I wonder for one point you become
concerned on creating

529
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,429
an Orwellian world in which half the
citizenry

530
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:45,429
is somehow informing on another

531
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:49,049
one of the problems we ran into in the
Phoenix program in vietnam is that

532
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:53,400
people were reporting on people in order
to kill people they owed money to

533
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,929
arm thank you very much arm

534
00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:03,110
I I like the Google Latitude

535
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,150
which is that the answer to too
dangerous information is more

536
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,600
information

537
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,340
home one of the reasons I believe that
we need to evaluate

538
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,760
information from the bottom up is that
the FBI has no clue

539
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,809
weather and Matilda is a credible story
or

540
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:24,000
whatever Joe Bob whatever but I think at
the neighborhood level you end up

541
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,480
knowing each other

542
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,830
on and I think that

543
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,909
citizen intelligence is really I mean
it's like Jamestown he who does not work

544
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:35,130
does not eat

545
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:38,809
he who does not think fuck off well

546
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,520
you know so we need to get to this point
we were all a vibrant HIF

547
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,200
on and that includes by the way swarming

548
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,730
threats to the Hive I mean just this
whole

549
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,270
air transportation thing is bullshit we
get it okay next asshole the pulls out a

550
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,530
box cutter is dead

551
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,220
okay any gonna happen so

552
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:07,280
about the New York ferry 7,000 rush hour
that's next

553
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,259
you gotta keep an eye but I think this
the cell phone thing 1191 14 I think

554
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,169
that's part of the solution

555
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:17,219
home and I think you also it's like
karma points in all eventually you

556
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,569
you learn who the lunatics are you start
toning them down

557
00:34:21,569 --> 00:34:24,870
I believe in citizen intelligence I
believe in reality I believe that

558
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,850
inherently people are good

559
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,449
arm if they know they're being watched

560
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,969
injure so it's better than what we've
got now

561
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,290
fifty percent of the dots that will
prevent the next 9/11 income from bottom

562
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:38,639
up

563
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,319
from cops & citizens on the street the
problem right now is that when they call

564
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:45,960
the FBI the FBI takes a number throws in
the bin

565
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,279
okay if I could care less what citizens
think

566
00:34:51,279 --> 00:34:55,819
might my second book is online for free
also my briefs by the way

567
00:34:55,819 --> 00:34:59,819
I mean I have a whole buncha briefs on
the new craft intelligence new rules for

568
00:34:59,819 --> 00:35:02,140
the new graphic they're all on my
website for free

569
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:06,089
yes sir yes %uh during your talk I
noticed that you mentioned

570
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:10,660
term hobbies Wahhabism hindi sms hobbies

571
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,870
looks like you understand the difference
between Shiites Sunnis in Wahhabis

572
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,500
but the problem is I noticed that and
the american people don't don't

573
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,819
understand these differences

574
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,960
and the media is also for training Hamas

575
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,490
okay done as well as as

576
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,140
people have the same school while they
are infect opponents or

577
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,450
hezbollah is actually leaning towards
Hamas

578
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,189
Res rather than al-qaeda why is that
created in the media and why are

579
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,910
will who benefits from deceiving people
into thinking

580
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:48,620
that they are actually the same one of
the problems that we've discovered

581
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:53,330
is that in this is well documented in a
book called the price of loyalty in the

582
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:55,630
one percent doctrine and so forth

583
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:59,319
dick cheney shot out the bureaucracy

584
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:02,830
the state department knows the
difference between Shiites in Silvis and

585
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,870
they know that

586
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:07,910
there's one in the majority that's close
to run this information

587
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,020
perhaps because dick cheney did not wish
it to move

588
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,370
this information did not get to george
bush he is

589
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,830
documented as having ordered the war in
Iraq

590
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,359
not realizing that he was doing a rock a
favor i mean Iran a favor

591
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,319
on and as far as terrorism goes

592
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:30,080
never underestimate the simplicity the
US government sexy a disclose the bin

593
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,380
Laden shop they've they've given up

594
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,520
just boggles the mind I think in line is
an honored guest to the Pakistani

595
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,600
government

596
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,839
as is the nuclear scientist

597
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,170
so what it boils down to is that you get
the government you deserve

598
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,580
you can't have a smart government when
you have a domination right now we have

599
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:58,319
a really dumb nation

600
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:02,160
one more question what where do you see
the American government moving towards a

601
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,720
%uh

602
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,730
the so the text books I'm actually so
you know I have studied these

603
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,120
religious text books and I I'm a Shiite

604
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,259
I belong to the minority Shiites in
saudi arabia and I remember when it's

605
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:14,990
one of the

606
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:18,080
things that we must the minority suffer
is that

607
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,580
we take tests we have two answer
questions that put us

608
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,950
and help I mean when you were you when
you when you

609
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,140
when they ask you a question what where
do the shiites

610
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,150
belong and the afterlife

611
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:35,370
we have to write we go to help you don't
get the versions

612
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,799
I'm sorry you don't get the Virgin on
for tonight by the way I'm curious some

613
00:37:38,799 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm told that one translation above the
seventy-nine versions is actually 79

614
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,100
dates knows it dates are virgins I have
no idea

615
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:51,370
what is it raisins so it raises not
virgins

616
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:57,779
I think they're virgins okay virgin
great sir

617
00:37:57,779 --> 00:38:01,710
white grape see I've heard the white
grapes version which is it

618
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:04,790
I'm sorry is that virgins are white
grapes

619
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,170
that you get if your martyr I dunno

620
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,130
I'm not sure really okay answer no sweat
already see the government

621
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:16,520
a blowing towards these text books which
are giving birth to more cherished every

622
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,200
day

623
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,549
the US government is stupid okay in Iraq
for example

624
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:25,210
we're dealing right now with the facts
and I have to go to the bathroom so

625
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,069
on in Iraq in Iraq we're dealing with
the fact

626
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:33,230
this is more information that you need
but I have a small club just wrote that

627
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,000
needs to be constantly lubricated

628
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,140
on in Iraq

629
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,620
we have we have written tribal histories

630
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,750
that have not been digitized in Iraq the
biggest source of tension between the

631
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,220
Sunnis and the Shiites at the
neighborhood level is over property

632
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,400
ownership

633
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,850
but when you open a property book it's
like the Dead Sea Scrolls

634
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,900
it actually fragments and so the US
government

635
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,020
isn't paying attention on they don't
care you're absolutely right the US

636
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,790
companies so

637
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:07,310
counterfeit I me paul Bremer will go
down its history is one of the most

638
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,470
destructive people on the planet

639
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,950
and also the maybe this is intense mom

640
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,040
then I'm gonna stop with this and I'll
come back if you want me to Iraq I can

641
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,540
go into smaller session

642
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,620
on but paul Bremer has been accounted
for

643
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,150
18 out of 20 billion dollars that he was
given in cash

644
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:32,150
you know alright I'll be right back

645
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:44,810
alright this is so someone's given me
notes

646
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:49,170
I know everything I don't but I have an
opinion on everything

647
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,510
arm in takeaways buy my books on Amazon

648

one else on the planet that is spent 18

653
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,830
years fighting for

654
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:17,210
open source intelligence on

655
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:20,510
you hook loop

656
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:25,390
Americans will change yes I

657
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,310
Americans I what we're gonna do this is
the last split and then if

658
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:32,310
if a few people want to have you know
two or three drinks that'll be great

659
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,580
because I love to have two or three
drinks before I go to bed

660
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,980
but that's it this guy answer for
everything

661
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,010
US the have an answer for everything a
fuck with this my son

662
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:49,200

I love you know i mean you can't I i
cant what

664
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,950
are you kidding me

665
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:03,090
he discovered his own mind at the age of
12 and I've been helpless ever since

666
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:06,430
yes sir

667
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:12,480
what you said is much what you're saying
is tragically true

668
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,470
is no there's no doubt any seasoned
observer here in New York

669
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:21,290
viewing what is going on

670
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:26,340
I'm forced to agree with certainly over
ninety percent of what you say

671
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:31,470
but the a major reason why things have
gotten

672
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,320
to the extent to the on now is because
of the inner

673
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,260
director and a the ineffective

674
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,230
and the which can you turn it in

675
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:50,330
you being disruptive go ahead please

676
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,860
I did I'm sorry for the okay a has been
the ineffective

677
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:59,240
and really erotic behavior of people
that normally would be

678
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,970
like a by the way somewhere in this
building 2 people having sex under a

679
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,490
table and I wish I were there

680
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:11,310
I this is what has the security guys it
is the fact that gun

681
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:16,410
of I

682
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,859
smiley I

683
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,910
a little side entertain with their are

684
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,779
what what i'm saying is that mostly
activist organizations here

685
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,080
have begun to it behavior and

686
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,970
such and ineffective in a radical way
and it's very very difficult to believe

687
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,820
that this is

688
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,120
by chance for example I've worked in New
York or mine life

689
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,549
there have been protests on foreign
policy

690
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,090
or my life why is that

691
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:54,180
there is never a protest at six th
Street and Park Avenue

692
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,609
or outside the Trilateral Commission or
near the American friends at the

693
00:42:58,610 --> 00:42:59,580
Bilderberg

694
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,180
or near the moose is trust

695
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,500
I mean you see every bite

696
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,460
here is treating symptomatology know by
a stream cause

697
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,800
nobody is dressing the ngos and the
central organizations and generating

698
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,830
these policies

699
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:21,400
it is in the state department the policy
is basically made in New York City

700
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,850
it goes down to Foggy Bottom is stamped
and they know what american policy but

701
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,470
it isn't

702
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,370
american policy it sees characters in
the Upper East Side

703
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:36,400
I agree with that and look unless people
really get outside those buildings in

704
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,680
your bloody murder

705
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,940
things are going to continue to
deteriorate if you cannot have known

706
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,360
enough

707
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:49,330
you cannot have organizations you saw
what happened at the at the 2000 morning

708
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,170
immediate the United Nations

709
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,970
nobody showed up to say to talk and
virtually anything

710
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:58,810
to a possible to people that came to
town they were brought into

711
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,470
a on oratory im that they were told to
get back on the bus is on leave

712
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:07,420
the World Economic Forum three hundred
people showed up

713
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,560
remember how may people sponsor show up
surprise or 3 p.m.

714
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:15,410
three hundred people showed up how does
that happen the entire

715
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,520
protest industry the interactive this
community

716
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,370
has sunk to level up such a rad a schism
in such ineffectiveness

717
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,009
that of course these people feel that
they can come out and do whatever they

718
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,570
want

719
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:32,020
because is no affective public response

720
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,980
why are there no protests outside of six
th Street and Park Avenue ever

721
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,020
UK got it arm

722
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,540
couple comments one

723
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,680
I think that lori wallach is onto
something

724
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,430
to I will refer you to a book by Bill
Moyers called doing

725
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:55,290
democracy in which he talks about the
eight stages

726
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,279
in most interesting to me because this
this was meaningful to me to point my

727
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,180
life where I thought I had failed

728
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,190
stage number five is we think you failed

729
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:08,510
and it's kind of a period of quiet but
in fact things are startin'

730
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,300
to jail and others are starting to
spontaneously move in that direction

731
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,580
what I think has changed in the last
couple of years

732
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:22,210
is the ability to share information and
mobilize people using hand-held devices

733
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,730
in lists and digests and so forth i mean
in kuwait

734
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,760
the winner organizing spontaneous
demonstrations by cell phone

735
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,980
on so I understand and agree with all
that you've said in fact I would say

736
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,240
that there is in fact an American
banking group there couple dangles on

737
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,630
this one is that I think that the

738
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,240
the Rothschilds were able to transport
to the United States of America their

739
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:50,770
concept the managing the country is if
we're all serbs

740
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,370
world peasants okay we just exist the
kind of feed the system

741
00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:00,880
I think that's their I also think that
you've got some extraordinarily

742
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,290
unethical people on Wall Street II we
freedom and

743
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:08,020
Mark Lewis is a lewis's liars poker

744
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:11,570
where talks about exploding the client's
okay

745
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:14,940
wall street will play the game for
themselves in the early days and then

746
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,130
they'll sell out

747
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,910
and the late you take the loss arm

748
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:23,020
finally bill clinton certainly
discovered that Wall Street was calling

749
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,300
the shots in his economy and today we
have the chairman of Goldman Sachs the

750
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,010
secretary treasury

751
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:31,670
this is not good news arm

752
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:34,900
you're absolutely right things are in a
very very

753
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:39,580
dire state of affairs but I half the
field

754
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,220
that sometime in the next seven years
we're going to see a major turning point

755
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,020
all of my reedy

756
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,470
I haven't read everything only read
about 3,000 books in 10 years

757
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:53,130
arm all my reading suggests

758
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:58,290
that we're about to move from a top-down
unilateral secretive decision-making

759
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,779
system

760
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,500
to a bottom up multicultural

761
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,740
open source intelligence DRI

762
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,840
okay open source intelligence system I
believe this

763
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,590
passionately on tell

764
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,330
can't do better than that you're right
on the problems but I think

765
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:21,720
you may be may be too pessimistic in

766
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,790
maybe I'm wrong but it gives me hope yes
sir

767
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,600
okay and now for something completely
different I have two legs

768
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,860
butts online likes you have two legs

769
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,710
spam with Tony understand

770
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:44,420
of but and I all honesty as we go on

771
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,000
are for something completely different
actually one

772
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,750
the items that is pretty much
cornerstone behind your open source

773
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,040
intelligence is pretty much news media

774
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:00,370
and Mike what are pretty much using that
to get an idea as far as what's going on

775
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,859
that's the shallow as part of the golan

776
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:07,270
sorry but the question actually comes
towards

777
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,000
maybe not so much from the mainstream
media perspective is somewhere that

778
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,170
there are some grassroots organizations
long lines like in the media

779
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,560
but are where they actually go and
actually investigate

780
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,910
the real news but as far at are one
perspective there of

781
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,220
but when it comes to mainstream I mean I
know I've

782
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,640
there have been a couple of it are
episodes in the times where

783
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,670
police recently with the wire-tapping
issue where

784
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:38,900
its kind aspirants such a backlash as
far as the first amendment rights

785
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:42,720
issue goes that's we've got members with
then

786
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,930
the congress and even are executive and
legislative branches to

787
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:50,890
actually wanna restrict that kind of
info our freedom even more so

788
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:55,810
actually century the times and also
other forms the Free Press

789
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,930
and I was kind of curious as far as here

790
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:03,859
uses or insights such censorship store

791
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:07,020
but let's take that from the field back
john falcon

792
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,220
from the Wall Street Journal wrote a
wonderful book called hotel warriors

793
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,320
in Robert Young Pelton who does the book
world's most dangerous places

794
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,560
and discovery show come back alive

795
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,770
arm it's well documented that

796
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:28,050
not only the media but the embassies are
essentially relying on third and fourth

797
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,750
hand information

798
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:35,300
they haven't actually put their boots in
the ground in their eyes on the target

799
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,820
so take that outside of a few
exceptional journalists like

800
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,340
robert kaplan site version so forth
second

801
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:46,990
we don't have a free media arm

802
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,150
in the run-up to the war in Iraq there
were a number

803
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,800
organizations and individuals ready to
pay one hundred thousand dollars in cash

804
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,350
full-page ads in the New York Times The
Washington Post Los Angeles Times so

805
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,279
forth

806
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,070
with very correct information against
the war

807
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:06,410
and these corporately owned newspapers

808
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,759
rejected those ads and when I spoke with

809
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,270
alvin toffler and I mention him the
other day but when I spoke with no flash

810
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:16,060
you know what's what's your piece by
piece is a big spot was a collapsible or

811
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,240
institutions

812
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,360
any specifically mention the New York
Times is no longer being reliable

813
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,080
and I agree with that arm

814
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:30,440
in in the Bush posturing against the New
York Times

815
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:34,600
I think that's as much show is anything
else because he had judith miller in the

816
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,840
New York Times

817
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,680
and judith miller was a direct asset
shared by

818
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,819
Israel in the Americans and the when I
breath

819
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:46,900
arm she did a lot of damage are

820
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,780
and the times guys knew it they try to
kinda block Corinne and stuff

821
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,970
now I I see all these problems may also
seek opening trippy has written his book

822
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,130
there's several books that

823
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,770
that every view on the new media

824
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:07,480
I think we're all agreed that blogging
is spa say now

825
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,740
it's it's no longer cool what is cool

826
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,970
is starting to set up distributed
network secure create structured

827
00:51:15,970 --> 00:51:19,440
answers to questions that authority

828
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,570
now let me address open source

829
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:25,880
on the media's the shallowest level

830
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,630
open source that's were favors that's
for the form broadcast information

831
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,870
service stops

832
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,509
okay below the media you have books

833
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:37,520
which gave this doesn't read the United
States America

834
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,330
killed the joint publications Research
Service which used to find and translate

835
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:46,440
important books in all languages for the
library of congress in for the general

836
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,720
distribution we don't do that anymore we
don't read books in the intelligence

837
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,020
community

838
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:56,160
on dissertations most knowledge starts
as a dissertation

839
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,210
we don't do for dissertation leaving the
American dissertations

840
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:05,290
okay and finally you have what I call
experts and observers

841
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:08,750
I was stunned five years ago to learn
that the the vice chairman of the

842
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,040
National Intelligence Council

843
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:13,230
didn't know what citation analysis

844
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,600
kate is the social science education
index in the Science Citation Index

845
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,390
created by Eugene Garfield an American
hero

846
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:24,250
it is to the scientific information and
I can identify four thousand dollars I

847
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,670
can identify the top 100 people in the
world

848
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:32,730
based on publications on anything and
through them I can identify the top 100

849
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,550
people who are unpublished

850
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:37,660
in the ngos governments and and so forth
see

851
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:41,569
doesn't do citation analysis this is
amazing

852
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,020
in part because they're not allowed to
talk to people don't have clearances

853
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,170
okay which is stupid on

854
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:51,400
so experts and particularly foreign
experts

855
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,820
absolutely vital and finally have
observers

856
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,100
we monitor sermons around the world

857
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,960
we do it in many different ways mostly
indirectly because now the sermons are

858
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,930
getting smart they've got

859
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,960
they've got detectors to to find tape
recorders and so it's getting harder to

860
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,920
get actual

861
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,740
tape recordings the sermons on but

862
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:20,520
sermons student papers lectures by
teachers

863
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,690
Chamber of Commerce meetings were local
problems are discussed

864
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:28,130
know this is coming into the united
states system

865
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:31,240
Nunavik alright we are

866
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:35,230
and a very superficial level nothing
pisses me off more than CNN in my

867
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,410
elevator

868
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:42,620
North

869
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,920
what's the point I don't know if I don't
think my son actually do this is a much

870
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,920
better artist but my brains are coming
out of my ass here

871
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,770
thank you whoever shared this with me on

872
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,740
so another question um for however each

873
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,960
how much we've been bashing mental
capacity if

874
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,740
conservative so far I feel like it's
something we should give them respect

875
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,870
for is their ability to rally

876
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,460
both their own supporters and the swing
vote mean they put billions of dollars

877
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,100
each year

878
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,100
two think tanks into getting people into
the proper position so that

879
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:22,490
such taking continue to control the
political

880
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:25,990
landscape caresses meanwhile

881
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:30,700
I think they don't bet on any sort of
infrastructure like that and

882
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:35,010
least most of their money on ineffectual
ngos back to George Soros wasted his

883
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:36,170
money

884
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,140
many chose so this wasn't even close to
putting his money wisely and American

885
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,180
politics:

886
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,560
so I'm I suppose what I'm asking is
would you blame

887
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:49,710
the ineffectual elections in this
country and just the

888
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:54,680
generally dismal landscaper politics
would you blame that on

889
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:57,910
the the population being stupid already
blame it on

890
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:01,089
basically having one party politics for
the democrats can't get their shit

891
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,220
together

892
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:06,720
well I don't I don't have all the
answers I'll speculate a little bit

893
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,020
first off there's no difference between
Democrats and Republicans

894
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:15,900
other than that the democrats are more
in apt they're both corrupt

895
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,380
me one reason I certainly don't want to
impeach george bush's because

896
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,510
Nancy Pelosi and the White House gives
me nightmares

897
00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:29,170
i sat next on an airplane once for six
hours

898
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:32,560
on there was a thought that came out
overhead

899
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,350
on

900
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,350
I think that there is this a problem
actually

901
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:44,089
with with witness may be called third
generation richer whatever

902
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:49,320
were coming off some good times in those
good times

903
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:54,710
we lost sight love citizenship we lost
sight of engagement we lost sight

904
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:58,490
love hearing it's become a cheating
selfish

905
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,280
culture by and large present company
excepted

906
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,740
home citizens abdicated their role

907
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:09,400
no I don't know if he's all my love you
know that the League of Women Voters

908
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,970
was thrown out love the debate business
specifically

909
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,540
to shutout third fourth and fifth party
candidates

910
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,590
in all that we had a remarkable slate a
few years ago

911
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:25,690
one of the first things we have to do is
get back to multi-party debates in fact

912
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,070
I want to take it one level lower I
think we absolutely have to force the

913
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,240
president's the picture cabinet in
advance to the election

914
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,380
america is too complex to be run by
white point as friends

915
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,100
okay we have to have cabinet-level
debates

916
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,350
at least defense state and justice home

917
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:47,370
so my bottom line is leaf

918
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:51,810
week he lost it you know we've we've had
it good we've had a good enough so we

919
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:54,290
didn't care how much they were still in
Wall Street

920
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:59,840
because we had a cheap gas & Cie here in
in all the stuff

921
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:04,900
someone else can have this I don't drink
beer boats me arm

922
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,980
so I don't I don't have any answers
other than I think we are going to see a

923
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,320
couple disasters that will be shocking
to us

924
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:16,780
and I also believe like that like the
new york blackouts in like combat

925
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:21,450
people come together under stress on in
under stress the elites are not going to

926
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:23,390
help us work to help ourselves

927
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:26,790
and that's as good as I can what

928
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:30,900
if it really was a disaster that was
really horrible and it's unfortunate the

929
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,240
most the people left behind were black

930
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:39,030
and that those are the most corrupt cops
on the planet mom

931
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:42,420
yeah I like built-in and in fact that
these cops I mean there's there's

932
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,290
there's your number of books in the
literature that suggests that Brown &

933
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:46,620
Root

934
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:50,279
is a CIA subsidiary that is also running
drugs into america

935
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,560
through all the construction equipment
that's coming back

936
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:57,100
and also through the or weeks off the
coast of New Orleans

937
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:02,260
sorry another question in reference to
power through economic control

938
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:05,810
let's make this is a somewhat behind ya
right these are the last request

939
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:08,570
I'll try to make this quick some people
coming on its fine I'm not I'm not

940
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:11,710
worried about time let's just stop for
the group with these last two questions

941
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,410
and then if anyone else has

942
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:16,430
private questions I'll speak this
gentleman

943
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:20,120
had no mention the builder X now

944
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,850
there's obviously a proven link between
you know economics and power

945
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:28,120
he controls money controls politics:

946
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,299
how do you see groups like the
Bilderberg someone

947
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:35,560
how do you see them even supporting
something like

948
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,609
officers and also west side this case
right after that

949
00:58:38,609 --> 00:58:41,940
well yeah to try to empowers people from
the bar by Mark I mean look they're

950
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,680
going to try to stop you and throw as
much money as they can

951
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:48,609
well one other I think too small to be
noticed yet

952
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:52,109
but one of the things that's interesting
is the only a power because we let them

953
00:58:52,109 --> 00:58:54,470
have power

954
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:58,950
if you look at the pension funds and the
unions and the opportunities for popular

955
00:58:58,950 --> 00:59:00,359
power

956
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:06,250
these guys are living on our backs
because we let them on our backs

957
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:09,690
if you stop buying all the ship that
they're selling

958
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,930
if you take your money into stocks and
put it into gold

959
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:16,980
in if you basically stopped playing
their game

960
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:20,390
or that's one insure the other answer is

961
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,870
I think that there will be a come to
Jesus meeting in 10 to 15 years

962
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:29,140
where a lot of the stuff that has been
stolen from us

963
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:33,879
will be retrieval I see no reason why we
can't take back all those

964
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,800
phil gates his fortune except for one
billion dollars

965
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:44,220
I think on

966
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,080
is not still needing it he's helping a
few syphilitic indian guys who work

967
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,700
where for each other use condoms

968
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,490
okay I am NOT impressed

969
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:02,490
I see if elected guys is a great term
now

970
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:07,680
alright last question in terms of
journalistic quality what are your

971
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:08,550
thoughts on

972
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:13,040
National Public Radio and if you had the
chance

973
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:16,390
given your open source intelligent
budget

974
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:21,460
you I would like to have would you
through more funding their way

975
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:25,310
I will tell you that I use to have a
great deal of respect for national

976
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:27,820
public radio until I found out that work
for auto

977
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,730
reich are they are actively censored

978
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,480
by the US government I used to be a
regular

979
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:40,090
Gaston NPR until one day I pointed out
that more palestinians were getting

980
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:40,690
killed

981
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:44,890
jus I was instantly banned from NPR

982
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:50,069
I will support NPR provided that it
moves under the Broadcasting Board of

983
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:53,460
Governors and the Broadcasting Board of
Governors which is outgoing public

984
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,700
diplomacy the open-source agency which
is incoming

985
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,870
information a reality or both completely
independent of the executive

986
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:04,359
in every way shape and form alright

987
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:08,370
god bless you all if someone wants the
money three vodkas

988
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:12,190
all talk injury for another half hour

989
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:13,250
and then I'm going to bed
