1
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:12,969
okay it's a good to be back in New York

2
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:19,750
after all this is where for me a lot of
things started it's always good to be

3
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,130
here always friendly people

4
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,730
and I'm going to tell you about song
exploits for mechanical

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,910
and even some electronic a box that
we've been found out over the last two

6
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,470
years

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,350
actions I was here a.m.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,010
on my right I this mark bias

9
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,839
he's the author of the big book we
figures cool

10
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:44,879
the Bible it's really very nice piece of
work

11
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,998
he's been you know playing with blocks
when I was in diapers

12
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:51,239
a.m.

13
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,039
okay but anyway he will introduce
himself

14
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,940
later on and let's get it started and
I'm

15
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,330
as I said a lot has happened since the
last time I was here

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,160
so much being only been two years ago
but a lot of things

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,660
were happening one other thing is that
are not be clubbed

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:15,190
to which is just you know nothing more
than a bunch of amateur

19
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,750
bickers looking to CS people really has
become a name in the industry

20
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,220
as mark since you know there's no single

21
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,289
lot manufacturing the world doesn't know
about us

22
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:30,040
and that's because from exploited re
brought it to the attention of

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,420
the public and media that we will talk

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,820
and this presentation a.m.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,619
this makes life easier for us because
you know if I'm at a conference or

26
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:41,229
anywhere

27
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:45,970
people just and me got away locks and
police test these before we

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:51,380
with the prof production a that if
there's a lot of advantages

29
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,949
on it a.m. someone to things have also

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:00,600
happens during the last time and it is
lock sports is growing rapidly

31
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,520
you know six or eight years ago I was
here

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,908
talking about look sports and some
people really picked it up

33
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,170
and this all started in Germany

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:14,640
where people started to pick locks big
locke says all the ins for

35
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,000
and went through the Netherlands and now
it's

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,310
spreading all over the world and this
looks

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,950
Sports Group set up in canada in

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,370
US is really getting somewhere also

39
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,560
there's some online communities that
have information that you know you

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,520
couldn't dream of

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,390
having two years ago one of the best
examples of that is

42
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,190
lockpicking 101 dot com as far as I
understand is run by just a couple of

43
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:43,780
kids

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,950
or just did it for the fun and now there
is

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,200
I don't know exactly how many thousands
of 10,000 messages

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,230
on their which love them are

47
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,320
really poor quality but if you ship
through them are really they are

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,670
but if you ship through them this
information there you will find that you

49
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,320
will find

50
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,340
nowhere else on the planet except maybe
behind some

51
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,540
closed-door said you know agencies am

52
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,440
and if you see through it you really
find some

53
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,280
very valuable things and I think picking
11

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,470
use is one of the

55
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,109
the most interesting things that have
happened you know the last two years

56
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,700
and it's really getting somewhere and
also you know those

57
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,310
this home next generation of young
people who sparked an interest

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,019
in lakhs lockpicking and physical
security and

59
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,200
you know this from really really bright
kits used thinking about locks and how

60
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,550
to exploit them

61
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,690
doing nothing else you know this is
there in this small village

62
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,489
and I don't know what's wrong with them
but they can only think about locks

63
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,540
just the just you know just like I was

64
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,859
and a.m. won a few examples and I'm not
sure if the last part its

65
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,390
guide evidence he also does
presentations

66
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,880
Def Con and he said she's really
talented guy

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,519
the knows his stuff and does excellent

68
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,450
presentations and one of the things
she's also good at is making graphics

69
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,340
and thanks to him a I will be able to
explain some of the things in axe

70
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,530
more clearly because a lot of his
graphics animated

71
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,280
gives I let me borrow it so

72
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,229
it works both ways you know if I have
some information he uses in his

73
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:29,909
prettiness presentations and if he makes
nice graphics

74
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,669
I can show you I'm

75
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:36,880
mechanical locks are not safe

76
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,350
maybe is not completely true because
there are some damn good mechanical

77
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,500
locks on the market

78
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,660
even I cannot bypass but at the end of
the day

79
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,780
mechanical works just you know they have
some fundamental problems

80
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,930
and as many ways that you can bypass or
exploit locks

81
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,100
there's a number of techniques
lockpicking

82
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,230
is bypassing and mark

83
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,770
to remove the strength

84
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,469
I from some sorry about that impression
ng and self-reproach inning

85
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,520
which is really something I like a.m.
then there's the coding I don't know if

86
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,130
I spoke about that before

87
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,550
and something you want to block all
pumping and

88
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,420
you know some people already know about
bumping and if you haven't known

89
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,980
if you haven't heard about bumping you
know this is going to be an interesting

90
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,830
lecture for you

91
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,130
okay lockpicking

92
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,360
ask the people in germany say picking is
fun fun

93
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,030
on how it's not

94
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,810
echoes MicroStation

95
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,750
group one I shouldn't have said anything

96
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,120
okay well use

97
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,120
a lot has happened not say

98
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,880
okay fun fun fun

99
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,820
okay well you know lockpicking really
got me hooked into learning about locks

100
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,340
because

101
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,520
you can only pick a lock if you know how
it works if you don't know how it works

102
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,599
gonna beat dem difficult to open it can
be done

103
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
but you know if you wanna get somewhere
you really

104
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,150
need to take blocks apart and understand
about them assistant exports have

105
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,710
much for groups have formed worldwide

106
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,080
a.m. to we have a very

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,270
used file game its some sort of

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,020
competition where we have a box of 26
locks

109
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,030
and everybody up to can try to pick is
LOX

110
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,030
as fast as they can and they can try as
many times as they can so frances

111
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,310
the number one more a might be

112
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,910
chalet creams and you know when I first
part

113
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,620
tried be the number one lakh it takes me
10 minutes and five seconds

114
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,000
and I think okay now I understand a
little bit better so I picked the number

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,560
two

116
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,890
alright begin again and now I'm
convicted in eight minutes

117
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:09,780
and i'm looking to my right I see that
somebody else pick that same or

118
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,350
25 seconds and I'm like okay how did you
do it

119
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,710
and then you know this brinks a level of

120
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,270
knowledge transfer between people Mike
how's it possible that you can with 25

121
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:21,859
seconds

122
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,060
what I can do it only in eight minutes
and

123
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,440
these really gets people to think about
marks and to copy techniques from each

124
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,660
other successful

125
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,320
and is really something Yahoo I'm proud
of that we

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,760
for the we came up with it and a fun
thing about not picking is

127
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,770
that you can help people when they are
more this happens to me approximately

128
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,130
one time a month

129
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,940
yeah I know how to find ion

130
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,250
and you know it really is rewarding if
you open the lock

131
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,580
once in awhile you know you're on your
knees for 15 minutes picking and it

132
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,190
doesn't work

133
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,840
and you know everything guys you know I
should have only watches video

134
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,180
another Askim what's up

135
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,990
but anyway

136
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,350
a most the time the door opens but

137
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,270
it's it's really rewarding if you can
use your them into your skills

138
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,500
for something to help other people now

139
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,150
as I said locks are have

140
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,680
vulnerabilities and the main reason why
looks horrible

141
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,470
if I need to go into that first they
need to explain

142
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,599
how does a lot were can everybody raises
hand

143
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,550
if X know how it works in detail

144
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,339
okay that's about 60-70 percent

145
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,580
very good a we have a laser pointer

146
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:52,580
markets government okay well as you can
see

147
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,520
a what I always considered the most
important part Oval Office the PLO

148
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,730
it's that round thing in the center of
the law that

149
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,960
at the end you know we would like that
to rotate

150
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,250
and the question these the question you
have to ask yourself

151
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:14,250
if you want to thank you I got my the
question you need to ask yourself who's

152
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,920
widest mark only turn with the correct
key

153
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,079
so I can ensure wrong key and won't turn
why does it turn when I'm sure the

154
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,590
correct

155
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,690
and I'm okay

156
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,460
that we have the block and there's
actually holes drilled

157
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,640
into the floor and it's too bad we can
see the house

158
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,630
but the house also has got these holes
and this you

159
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,300
you know this is the house the law this
part and

160
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,860
you see that there's to specs or two
pins on top of each other with the

161
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,430
spring

162
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,650
spring and you see that if the key is
inserted into the lock

163
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,069
and it lifts the point where these two
pins are of each other exactly the point

164
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:59,160
where the house block meet each other
then in turn

165
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,209
if it's this position it's not blocking

166
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,840
if it's now in this position it's
blocked because it can turn

167
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:11,890
is that is that clear to everybody okay
thanks so

168
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,900
once we noticed them there is a question
how can I won't be picked what's

169
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,570
you know it's nice that the key lifts
these beings to specific hi

170
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,760
where the great line these bins

171
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,920
are exactly in the right place how can
that be exploited by

172
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,290
my macbook a that's because mechanical

173
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,839
the perfect imperfections add up I've
been

174
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,759
you successive to I visited many

175
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,509
lock factories already and you know I
see how these locks are made in

176
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:47,970
this help to really helps me to clearly
see what happens

177
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,529
is that that normally if you look on top
of this blog

178
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,980
there is four holes are actually more to
time it's five

179
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,769
but in destroying its four a.m. and
these holes

180
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:03,749
in a perfect world drill except lead in
the center of the of

181
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:07,480
the round block a.m. but what I've seen
is that

182
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,529
there's a machine actually has five
drills

183
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:14,850
and you know just drills into this poor
with five dudes at the same time

184
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,749
orders a drill that you know drills and
makes five holes in a row

185
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:23,809
now what's gonna happen that if you
drill million of these blocks

186
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,079
in a row a the the drills will

187
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:30,290
get out of alignment a little bit it's
not much I mean

188
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,529
this is I V XA curator but for into the
first one is off to the left

189
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:38,209
the second one way off to the right this
is reasonably center

190
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:41,910
but these two a.m. you know clear

191
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,039
to 22 to be out of the center

192
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:48,839
another thing is that the shape of the
bins

193
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:52,839
a also seen these beings made the made
out of the choir

194
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:55,839
and there's a machine that does nothing
nothing else and

195
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,160
you know X wiring catch it into these
very hard metal pins

196
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,189
and as you can understand that the first
been

197
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,219
the cons of the machine line ish just
little bit different

198
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,289
thicker or thinner than the one
millionth been

199
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:14,359
that comes off that line so the speech
you know that very

200
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:18,149
thickness and its its it's not much I
mean if you look at it with the naked

201
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:21,449
you probably not going to see it and if
you measure it you know

202
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,919
it just depends on how good the lock
companies but at the end of the day

203
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,879
these beings ferry in thickness and
these holes

204
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,759
not completely in alignment and that
actually is what makes locks vulnerable

205
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,850
and pickle because what happens is the

206
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,709
if you assemble a lock and you start to
pick the lock

207
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:49,009
the first thing you do is you insert
pensioner into the lock

208
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,699
and the tensioner is nothing more than a
piece of flat metal

209
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,989
thats you know you want to rotate this
blog with

210
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:00,959
and what happens now is if you attention
in the lock

211
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,139
see 0

212
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:07,139
if you put a pensioner in the lock a.m.

213
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,649
because of the difference in thickness
of the beings

214
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,830
and because of the

215
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,660
difference in the holes not all beings
are going to prevent that look from

216
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,240
turning

217
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,720
so what you do with picking each you one
by one

218
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,040
lift the peace and you go for the
thickest be

219
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,010
because think it's been will bind and
things that are more thing

220
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,149
will just be lift up and fall back again
because then

221
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:36,029
not the one preventing the look from
turning wanna try to send their

222
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,520
only one or two pins in the law at the
same time

223
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,230
will prevent the more from turning an
issue see it wasn't there is one it

224
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,779
wasn't this one so it has to be this one
now

225
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,480
a.m. that's just you know a little bit
thicker

226
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,459
and that's the one actually preventing
the mark from during which a pensioner

227
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,110
and I will pick a lock

228
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,280
I'll try to pick one here on the screen
so I can show you

229
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,610
but with the so-called think a pic

230
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,930
you and that the lock and you live the
bins and if the been

231
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,830
stick is the biggest one then it will
bind and you know it will stay

232
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:16,680
it will rest on the poor while the core
itself turns a little bit

233
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,040
and now there's only one been blocking
this work from turning

234
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,040
and you'll see slowly but surely

235
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,740
the law

236
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,560
you know your computer slow so

237
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,710
was maybe fires or whatever

238
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,520
anyway okay

239
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,750
so this lock picking in theory I will
trying to show you with that document

240
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,710
the camera

241
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,960
and okay now

242
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,130
people when they see my except you know
they're always really

243
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:05,320
impressed saying gonna

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,320
you know what I'll just

245
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,930
I'll just switch to document camera

246
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:24,930
sure

247
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,569
okay now people you know when they see
the thing wow you know if I had a

248
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,680
people said like that I could open a lot
of locks actually

249
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,870
you only need a couple of pics eyes very
nice

250
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,910
that you have a thousand different big
send you buy these pictures on the

251
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,540
internet that have 125 different tools

252
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,079
but at the end of the day you only use a
few

253
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:05,080
sweep ok

254
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,460
okay the end of the day you only need a
few pics

255
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,920
what's most important about a good
picture is that you have

256
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,080
a wide variety of ok pics and as you can
see the center who picks the finger

257
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,600
picks

258
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,840
and this is pictured we have specially
made for old number six

259
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,960
so you know you really should try to get
one and

260
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,480
these are two rapes and later on will be
at the second floor

261
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,690
where there's an olympic village and
will train people

262
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,800
you know in explain how the Lord works
and how to

263
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,030
Big Lots yourself so you should really
try visit us

264
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,709
and experience the joys of picking
yourself which is not that difficult

265
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:55,830
on most locks and you know it more
difficult to look become

266
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,720
but yup and what's also important is
that the pensioners

267
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,660
in the in the kids have different sizes
because it's nice if you have twenty the

268
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,530
same size

269
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,899
pensioners but these pensioners is what
actually is

270
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,410
turning the law and with this simple but
elegant picture that we

271
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,070
made I'm we have four different size

272
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,458
of attention or Sunday will fit
practically any law

273
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,650
and I'm really proud of this picture
because we sat down together with

274
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,680
somebody with chem program

275
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,500
and we do with ourselves so this really
is what I consider one of best picture

276
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,330
and it's not that expensive its 30 bucks

277
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,260
okay now

278
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,320
we now see a how long between works

279
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:49,159
so what are the industry try to prefent

280
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,800
picking now use were difference

281
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,850
moving gives comment for into they have
designed

282
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:59,290
the so-called mushroom shape it's a
special CBI

283
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,120
if you put tension on the PLO it will go
already a little bit

284
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,640
and the head is much thicker then the
rest of the

285
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,870
been and intellectually because there

286
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,950
and this is what makes life difficult
for macvicar

287
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:18,420
but on your interest on the other side
keeps it interesting they also made

288
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,360
very narrow key ways if you can see this
is a European evermore

289
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,110
it's got an extremely narrow key way
that goes from left to right six acting

290
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,020
all the way up

291
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,080
so tools are almost impossible to fit in

292
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,480
this key way while the key for scanning
and they also design

293
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,200
the people

294
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,720
mocks you know that small holes

295
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,990
instead of featured products these can
also be big but

296
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:52,990
require special tools is there an
interest that I pick a lock

297
00:18:53,380 --> 00:19:00,380
on stage to show you how it works for
sure we do that the second floor

298
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,040
downstairs here

299
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:26,730
think my simple or okay

300
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,770
what you have here is pensioner and

301
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,350
you inserted strategically into the
lower in a place

302
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:42,240
where but you still have room to ensure

303
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,860
the other switching so I now go into the
lock

304
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,920
with the rupee and I will go in this
paper sector

305
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,390
a few been to the binding and

306
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:02,390
by the time out already said 2 pins

307
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:09,670
two more

308
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,230
and okay now this is a very simple or

309
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,620
a but it's been and

310
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,970
you know this is actually all there is
to it do it with

311
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,210
picking locks really come down

312
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,620
the second floor later of presentation
and

313
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:33,620
we'll show you how it works

314
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,789
okay as I said there's a time for every
law just depends on if it's available

315
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:46,990
for the public or not

316
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,220
a.m. dimple looks can be picked to

317
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,490
more difficult to look the greater the
challenge I mean upbeat remarks that

318
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,480
other people for

319
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,539
really you know not become all even the
manufacturer things I'm cheating

320
00:20:58,539 --> 00:21:02,360
we spoke not become friends lower in Las
Vegas

321
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,340
and I convince them you know I could
a.m.

322
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:10,090
and there's no such thing as an and
become a market sometimes just takes

323
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,158
forever to open

324
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,140
which is also more or less and people
but its which

325
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,929
it with like like we could talk for you
know long enough time

326
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,799
anything of all a

327
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,400
for this you know site speaking to us
other methods

328
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,950
and one of the methods I really like is
by BOSS

329
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,610
when you buy possum or you don't pick if
you just go for

330
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,190
whatever keeps the war lock and you
don't mind for combinational you don't

331
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,929
mind for a key or whatever

332
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:44,320
you just with a wire with some
cleverness

333
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,399
going to the lock and try to open it

334
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,590
and a broader economy model of popular

335
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:57,590
monster combination padlock show

336
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:23,830
okay issue and see semester nice thing
about it

337
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,289
is that it's a cutaway model

338
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:34,320
so you can actually see doing

339
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,059
and what I'm doing is I will use this

340
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,720
shame to go into

341
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,320
the combination so not sure you can see

342
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,799
and

343
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,320
just inserted into law then

344
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,240
first to shackle lifts you

345
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,240
his you see

346
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,539
the problem is everybody thinks is a
secure

347
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:30,100
have lockers many others and reality are

348
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,990
okay

349
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,230
I'm and here's his little brother from
phoning

350
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:49,230
time that's the way to do it

351
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,850
its

352
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,919
okay here sits a here's his little
brother

353
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,230
and I found that it's actually a little
bit more

354
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:12,230
fights to enter the two so really hope
it works

355
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:28,470
let me first right

356
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:43,770
okay problem is these are twenty thirty
thirty five dollar locks and their

357
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:50,440
representatives secure other
manufactures in a lot of cases they are

358
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:50,950
not

359
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,240
you need to know sure the thing is
everybody

360
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,240
things is a secure lock because gotta
fortified check all

361
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,910
you know if you start loving it with a
hammer it probably will

362
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:08,910
last quite long I'm but not if you have
this that the engine wire

363
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,020
now other ways to bypass security

364
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,889
and 1 I'm going to show you now is
something actually from

365
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:36,750
gray area of and use it means
non-destructive and reviews

366
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,870
the police and intelligence agencies
they have the special teams that you

367
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,230
know you can only dream of entry

368
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,670
a and what they do is you know they open
doors for people

369
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,080
please box or look for evidence or
whatever and

370
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,310
and what los low-skilled in the

371
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:57,629
teams will do is that they would use rip
to work out a few door which is not

372
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,050
really non destructive entry

373
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,680
a using the courts for math

374
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,810
that there's a vulnerability in European
markets that in

375
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,340
with a special way you can usually rip
it out

376
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,890
dislike you unscrew a bottle of wine you
know you

377
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,550
drew you'd really screwing to the lock
new place force with the special to

378
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,600
and a complete look from top a.m.

379
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,620
but then you know markers destroyed I
mean they can enter but the work is

380
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,440
destroyed so people are going to see you

381
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,540
and what they will do is if beings

382
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,420
in the law are still in fact if they're
not broken they will

383
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,460
woods the beans from your original lock
into a new look that they brought to

384
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,830
this the same brand and model

385
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,000
and they'll replace it for you so you
get your free law you know

386
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,680
Anna on the other hand sometimes these
beans are destroyed

387
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,250
or just is no time for them to actually

388
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,310
exchange these bins

389
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,830
so throw you in the so-called it's
translated from Dutch

390
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:00,280
0 and 20 more use lock with much more
than one

391
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,590
or two pins on top of each other lock
switch

392
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:07,590
11 or 12 pins on top of each other very
thin waivers

393
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,100
and that creates much more combinations

394
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,340
at the local open with as a matter fact
open with any key

395
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,540
because the so many breakpoints in this
law

396
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,470
this is actually a video of one of the
zero marks

397
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:28,450
me okay

398
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,590
as you can see there's to parts
remaining in the core

399
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,930
to one 3 10 now do is

400
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,400
I'm on certain other key sorry about
this is being sold are

401
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,310
with your own discs stacks

402
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:47,220
she 311 20

403
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,590
these what you know this is the
combination extra

404
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,830
of this key and I will do

405
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,689
one honor key that will have yet another
combination

406
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,120
this this local actually open with any

407
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,430
key that fits the law and

408
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:08,809
you know it's it's also a way of
bypassing security its

409
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:12,080
taking advantage of you know how locks
are made

410
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,490
and we only care if are key features we
think are key fits that's the only thing

411
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:21,929
aryan

412
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:25,990
it will work with a screwdriver Nokia no
as long as

413
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:29,990
as long as you live lower pins you know
it won't work

414
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:33,650
this this time beings need to be

415
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:40,650
he's pushed down a little bit then

416
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:47,039
there said impression an impression is
really one

417
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,230
things that I really like about opening
techniques

418
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:53,980
freshening is where you put tension on
the lock

419
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,929
and by doing that the beans bind and
then

420
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:01,720
you have these binding Beach either
scratch

421
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,500
make a dent into metal into your key or

422
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,679
worshiping down and is actually what I'm

423
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:11,710
going to do a.m. as a matter fact

424
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,230
depression can also be done with very
simple tools like

425
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,690
around for the paper and some people
already know about

426
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,990
you know where this is heading to on the

427
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,419
so we'll go back to the document camera
now

428
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:32,419
sure you something

429
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:48,168
okay this is a yet to win a pic and

430
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:51,619
its used for picking so-called locks

431
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:56,529
and what we have here

432
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:59,959
is I'm nice Peter art its plastic

433
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:06,959
to lamar I hope you can see it

434
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:15,190
mmm okay this doesn't come out this
nicest hoped

435
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,190
maybe we can zoom in

436
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:30,270
Rockwall

437
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:46,610
I think they had a problem with their
regular camera well

438
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:53,610
these to the locks I think you've all
seen them before

439
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:04,110
ok

440
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,510
yes these are two blocks

441
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,149
very popular with bikes

442
00:31:09,149 --> 00:31:11,779
security locks all sorts of

443
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,120
I think on and the nice thing about
compression tools like this

444
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:20,470
is that they will soften fresh what
actually will happen is that

445
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,240
these black wires you see here

446
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,460
are going to be pushed out by

447
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,590
beings binding and if I just legally

448
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,860
time and time again already goes

449
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,350
already really can go

450
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:43,000
really quick this is by itself no

451
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,240
why them I law you can see here

452
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,480
but bins

453
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,730
actually pushed back these like he's
metal because they're bound

454
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,580
when that happens you know the more
creates

455
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:08,580
the key for you three me to show you

456
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,610
one with paper or sure

457
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:23,610
ok

458
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,050
now

459
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,340
mark issued a a security alert on these

460
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,590
kensington let the blocks a on

461
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:00,820
security or secure security website the

462
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,889
and babysitter a conference

463
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,260
and at this conference

464
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,780
some people ask me you know can you show
us how to open the second check the

465
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,230
locks

466
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,750
with the SoCal entry so instead of this
impression into

467
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,880
showed you you producers specific been

468
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,360
by big brands and but you know

469
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,300
spent not available in Europe where this
conference was so

470
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:29,570
I really tried hearts finding material
that Woods

471
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:34,570
be hard enough to pushed been but be
soft enough

472
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:39,110
to to have dance made in a

473
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:45,609
and I tried everything tried carts from

474
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,519
from the hotel business cards

475
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:52,599
tried a lot of things and I was really
you know one moment thinking

476
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:57,619
okay what material should I use and then
I wanted one place in the mood

477
00:33:57,619 --> 00:34:01,099
saw this roll of toilet paper

478
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:04,559
and as you can see

479
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,399
locus open now if you can she

480
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,299
and if your insurance Roy

481
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:20,299
this weekly

482
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,840
demonstration okay now it's locked

483
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,569
is it

484
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:44,569
only work once nation more

485
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:55,820
well I made my point thing or ob

486
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,869
couple comments are in order at this
site this is an old

487
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:07,369
a model love this lock we did release a
security alert two years ago

488
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:10,839
August as a result of that

489
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:14,410
pick up all the leading manufactures I'm

490
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,700
have drastically increases security on
their laptop locks they

491
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,720
took this very seriously out we
obviously got a lot of feedback i've

492
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,330
provided feedback to them

493
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:28,839
I'm the new revision I'm

494
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:32,700
I don't think you're gonna do this a
everybody's figured out that it's not

495
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,380
the computer you're stealing it

496
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,280
or protecting it's the data within it
the the hardware is

497
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,920
irrelevant compared to the information
I'm

498
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,930
I have brought with me for the village

499
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:48,940
I some of the new kensington

500
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,690
tubular locks that you'll find
incredibly more secure

501
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,700
this is not to say that they can't
ultimately be open to either they're not

502
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,150
a high security lock

503
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,330
but they are designed to act as a
deterrent and

504
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:09,319
I am shirt now from first-hand knowledge
they will do that

505
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,200
both kensington PC Guardian have paid
attention all you and all the IT people

506
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,609
that raise hell with them

507
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:20,549
and so you're fine much greater security
and peace of mind now for your laptop's

508
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,740
as I said this is an old design the new
designs are drastically different very

509
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,300
okay

510
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,250
yes and then there's a thing called

511
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,839
decoding and decoding is also an
interesting technique because with the

512
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:41,490
coding

513
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,820
you don't open the lock with the to
decoding

514
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,160
just you know revealed the combination
of the lock to you

515
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,770
and then you can make after work this is

516
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,920
being used in

517
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,630
two fields and of course non destructive
entry teams

518
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,770
uses a lot because they only need to see
the only need assistance once and then

519
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,500
they have a key

520
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,730
and they can give it to people in the
field to do their job one of the

521
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,550
decoders I brought actually very nice
piece of equipment its

522
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,030
BMW to track decoder it used for

523
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,520
BMW but there's also you know these
tools are also available for Mercedes

524
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,850
for

525
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:28,700
many different types of locks and
actually exploits another weakness in

526
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,190
these

527
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,920
systems and that is that these looks
don't have

528
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,360
been used to have wafers so it's it may
not

529
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,790
one piece of mental and metal has a hole
in it

530
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,890
convicted to the next a.m.

531
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:46,690
you can measure the depths by pushing up
the waves as high as you can

532
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:52,140
this is the flaw show you also not a
thing is that these wafers

533
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,589
they don't have close tolerances meaning
that if you

534
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,180
could stick something in that's
approximately two key that would be good

535
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,520
enough

536
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
this container also this

537
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,390
said certain things make cookies

538
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,430
so after your decoder you can

539
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:16,060
make your own key the code works
perfectly on mono still 2004

540
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,670
new models they made a small change that
make it a little bit more difficult

541
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,760
but I've been told that it still can be
done it just takes a little bit longer

542
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,400
now this is when our way for more

543
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,400
looks like and I will get this point

544
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:50,788
okay this waterway for lock looks like

545
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:53,880
as you can see in the is your position

546
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,249
if there's no key in little NOP will
just

547
00:38:57,249 --> 00:39:01,979
stick out of the core and it will
prevent it from

548
00:39:01,979 --> 00:39:05,089
turning in real life there's the same

549
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:09,499
not you see here is also an upper side
so I don't know why Devin

550
00:39:09,499 --> 00:39:13,279
didn't drawn I think you should

551
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:18,339
I said okay

552
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:23,249
this is so version 0.9 anyway

553
00:39:23,249 --> 00:39:26,650
up there use with this BMW look there is

554
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,209
actually for combination so the way for
can either be

555
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:33,558
a away for one to three or four and

556
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,069
the only difference is that the distance
between the gap

557
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:41,380
and the doc is different so

558
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,459
they're all identical but this distance
you know 24

559
00:39:45,459 --> 00:39:48,489
got a very small March 21 has got the
biggest notch

560
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:52,059
and that's actually that the only thing
that's different

561
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:55,539
of these four levers for different
levels

562
00:39:55,539 --> 00:39:59,369
in the law this if he's never seen the
lock and

563
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:02,900
as I said tolerances are sloppy see

564
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,410
this is the decoder to and its

565
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,538
it's a really nice high quality too it's
made in Germany by a company called

566
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:16,369
he fix they also sell you know lots of
great interest in

567
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:20,390
tools and what you see on the side are
the so-called maker

568
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:24,769
user setup piece and the weakness of
this lock is also that

569
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,380
if you have a sucky and for instance

570
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,749
the combination should be 1234 you
notice a mark that contains

571
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:37,729
every way one two three and four if you
use to set up to you should only have to

572
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:39,759
use the centerpiece with

573
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:43,170
difference between one and two

574
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:47,369
so we call that one and the difference
between three and four we call that

575
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:50,589
to so taken they confronted to

576
00:40:50,589 --> 00:40:54,219
of step peace so one-and-a-half wanna

577
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:57,890
of two-and-a-half two-and-a-half also
open

578
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,009
are three-and-a-half three-and-a-half
also opened is lock so

579
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:06,829
and an all show you this

580
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:09,930
a.m. if you want I can show you two

581
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,609
on the crappy

582
00:41:11,609 --> 00:41:18,609
display if you people find it
interesting

583
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:41,300
here's the here's to and

584
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,750
it's got a little needle and if you can
see that sticks

585
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:52,750
out you

586
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:04,200
should come

587
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:15,299
actually if you look there you see
something

588
00:42:16,779 --> 00:42:20,500
and this is lips the levers and you can
adjust

589
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:24,319
with this slider who said which lever

590
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,319
you want to decode and then if you
insert it into the lock

591
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,569
like this we're now decoding lever
number 6

592
00:42:43,569 --> 00:42:47,739
and if you turn and you feel

593
00:42:47,739 --> 00:42:53,249
noted can go beyond to then

594
00:42:53,249 --> 00:42:57,150
you know you just go to never its and
then

595
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,279
lady you can use the the setup key to

596
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:03,359
to actually make

597
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,939
key that fits the lock but you know I'm
gonna skate

598
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:10,598
its just show you what's available on
the market

599
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,180
really high tech tools said this for
every law

600
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,189
that is really is

601
00:43:18,189 --> 00:43:25,189
you know very high

602
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:50,099
now decent lever locks can also be
picked and I just saw a great big from

603
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:51,250
somebody in korea

604
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,470
who designed this and what he actually
did was he

605
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,690
take an existing key mill out everything
there is

606
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:01,690
except the edges remain

607
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,880
and the drill two holes checking on the
position of the levers

608
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,220
and reduced to you can actually lift the
lever one by one

609
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,700
and you can relatively easy big and it's
really neat design and I haven't seen

610
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,420
anything

611
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,069
like this before and I really want to
shared with you and I'm

612
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:21,509
assume that there's a lot of people
really value this idea

613
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:24,510
and J's website this

614
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,609
also miss that so now

615
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:33,020
something real special is the full in
the corner it was

616
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,660
exclusive design for special
intelligence operations for a long time

617
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,049
to be released for locksmiths for a very
short time

618
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,109
this is where I you know minutes to

619
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:47,259
to collect it and what it does is it
slips an extremely thin wire

620
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,550
between been and the housing core

621
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,560
always has to be someplace and what this

622
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,420
think us is used to

623
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,430
and there's an extremely them wire

624
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:03,799
and thin wire comes out you can see you

625
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,000
and that wire is so thin that it will
slide

626
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:11,119
between the house and beings and the

627
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,750
disentangle on the tip of his wire so
soonest this

628
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:18,520
wire reaches the point where these two
pins are on top of each other it wants

629
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:18,849
to

630
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,819
creep im this small crack you will feel
it so

631
00:45:22,819 --> 00:45:27,000
you know you can feel how much why are
you need to insert into the lock

632
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,750
and if it's five point six millimeters
ten you know that the penis

633
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,020
com being six for instance and if

634
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,940
wires less or more you know you can
identify the link the bins

635
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,099
with the speaker wire and this actually
is one of the most clever

636
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:45,609
to survive seen in a long time and

637
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,950
I'm happy that I had in mind that I have
in my collection

638
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:53,119
so

639
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,980
see more yes test

640
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,780
sniper to learn to become I think people
have seen this

641
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,060
already before works

642
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,350
with

643
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:09,279
to transfer impact energy I'm

644
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:16,280
you all know newton's cradle I think

645
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,400
the device here if you take the first
fall on you let it drop

646
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,040
then only the los Pongo and it's the
same here

647
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,500
with these two full balls if you take
the white one

648
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,600
you shoot at this fast as you can onto
these two

649
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,220
only lost one will go and this is
exactly how the sniper gun works

650
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,560
begun a.m. it will

651
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,009
needle will be inserted into the law it
will strike

652
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,510
an impulse energy polls and

653
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:53,170
it will bounce only two puppies Anderson
a very quick moment

654
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:56,700
where the shoreline is open and free and

655
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,130
the core can actually wrote a and you
know that's the end up and the story

656
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,760
and it's a very effective method opening

657
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,160
what they did truck tried to prevent

658
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,680
is you know making he weighs more narrow
that

659
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,299
to keep on going order

660
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:20,610
office never can go in and then we come
to bumping

661
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:25,350
and bumping the sexually which kept me
busy for lost

662
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,620
two years and also made

663
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,100
us known lock industry and in security
industry also

664
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,130
I'm I first learned about pumping

665
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:40,780
in Germany germans for group where they
had some gentlemen

666
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:47,230
name clausen of demonstrated this and it
really blew my mind exploits a

667
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,200
vulnerability

668
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,070
marked you know it's relevant to almost
any been luck in the world

669
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,610
with this technique you can open the
walk without damaging it in very little

670
00:47:56,610 --> 00:47:57,230
time

671
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:00,990
with little training inexpensive tools
and I brought some

672
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,090
bomb keys and locks you can try to show
billige

673
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:07,590
and I'm sure you will like it I am

674
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:11,640
we tested 100 marks to see if they were
vulnerable for this technique

675
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,120
and it all started with a white paper

676
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:18,560
rope myself Road I'm

677
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,610
we've been on national television in the
Netherlands with if you have time you

678
00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:23,180
really should

679
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,569
wanna see that episode it's amusing a

680
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,780
there some videos on the boxer for that

681
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,670
you know explain more on

682
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,969
technical details about being and we
just did a test for the Dutch consumer

683
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:37,940
reports

684
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,619
this thing about ever almost and the
security lock

685
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,660
in the industry against pumping to see
if

686
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,859
really use us stress threatening

687
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:50,859
as we think it yes a.m.

688
00:48:50,859 --> 00:48:55,119
we also seem to have Russian fan club by
now marks

689
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,420
not are you and I don't know what mafia
guys behind

690
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,309
tonight is good a.m. but it's really
scary

691
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:06,229
whatever I do you know if I publish
something on this marks not are you

692
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:10,859
everything I do is being translated to
German within hours

693
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:15,339
headed by common that I don't understand
have I don't know what these people are

694
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:15,819
up to

695
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:20,829
it scary a.m. and then there's a
security guard or

696
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:24,729
by Mark Byers it's a little less scary
but it's good

697
00:49:24,729 --> 00:49:28,729
its high sky high quality articles on US
story on bumping

698
00:49:28,729 --> 00:49:32,699
month I am enough about pumping let's
tell you what companies about

699
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:36,579
now if you want to bump open a lock

700
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:40,160
what you gonna need use monkey

701
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,279
and a bump keys any key that will fit
the lock

702
00:49:43,279 --> 00:49:47,069
and you have to cops all the cops in the
lock

703
00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:50,808
as deep as you can so normally there are
ten steps in a more

704
00:49:50,809 --> 00:49:54,569
if there's a code 0 that means that no
material

705
00:49:54,569 --> 00:49:58,979
for instance this could be a code 0 i
am.

706
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:02,229
it means that there's no material taken

707
00:50:02,229 --> 00:50:06,150
no I think yeah

708
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,690
this this could be called 0 for instance
no material is taken off

709
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,460
and then it goes down in steps from you
know 1234

710
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,940
and then nine princes is the people's
position now

711
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:20,529
what you do with bumping issued a kooky
or you take a blank doesn't matter

712
00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:23,970
and you Cup every cut their use to the
people's position

713
00:50:23,970 --> 00:50:28,089
that's the first step then you remove

714
00:50:28,089 --> 00:50:31,569
a small fraction of show more of the key
and people the key

715
00:50:31,569 --> 00:50:35,799
I'm this is you know like quarter
millimeter I don't know exactly

716
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:39,049
what that translates to

717
00:50:39,049 --> 00:50:43,249
inches wide and then that number three
is

718
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:47,170
if you taken off some of the tip in the
shoulder you ensure

719
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,950
to key into the lock and you push
Richard from and you feel

720
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:55,589
if it comes back a little bit so there's
Springs here and the spring to actually

721
00:50:55,589 --> 00:51:01,249
tried to push the key back out again
step forward to tomorrow

722
00:51:01,249 --> 00:51:04,430
there was a gentleman Germany could
chill girl

723
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,650
who design this impact energy to

724
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,299
and is nothing more than a small mamet's
but he really thought about it for a

725
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:13,319
long time before

726
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:16,910
finalized his thing and this release

727
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,379
what you need to open locks with the
pumping method a.m.

728
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,619
although no as we speak you know pumping
is gaining

729
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:28,960
popularity and its people other people
making these how much too because court

730
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,529
is 92 or 93 years old when he doesn't
make a whole lot of these hammers

731
00:51:32,529 --> 00:51:36,069
and more conferences we do two more

732
00:51:36,069 --> 00:51:39,819
the mom the race for the summers of a
this actually

733
00:51:39,819 --> 00:51:44,229
hammer made by Peterson in the US that's
got holes

734
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:46,400
in it and you can

735
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,080
use let Wade other stuff too make it
more heavy

736
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,560
this is a hammer made from shoe sole by

737
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:58,890
don't Andrews from Germany he said

738
00:51:58,890 --> 00:52:02,359
locksmith and also shoe repairs and he
made a hammer

739
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,820
now but the Hammers really affected

740
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,880
it's called the power hammer and you
know if you need a little more power

741
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,050
than

742
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:14,670
hammer and then you open the lock as
we've seen with the

743
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:17,740
with begun

744
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:20,940
you have this impact energy now what you
do with the 999

745
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,210
the issue inserted into the lock you
make sure it was a little bit

746
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:29,040
you hit with a hammer with tomahawk at
the head of the key

747
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,390
and what will happen is that the energy
that goes into the lot needs to go

748
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,140
somewhere

749
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,790
and a poppin to adjust move up and
that's it

750
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,440
at that moment you can turn the lock
there's a little timing issue

751
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:45,200
but once you must you know with this
technique you can open

752
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,740
any lock of that brand almost you'd

753
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,750
so it doesn't matter if it has these for
being too much from being too whatever

754
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,790
you know if it's if you to stand a mock
you have a key defeated

755
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:00,250
you've got to keep down take off a
little bit of the shoulder injury he did

756
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,260
with the right equipment

757
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,020
you do need a ride exact moment local
open

758
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,950
the stronger as the moment I said

759
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:13,240
a.m. now with this this really you know
house

760
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,400
high-impact on security and mark

761
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,729
will tell you all about it I am

762
00:53:20,729 --> 00:53:23,960
you also tell you what we learn because
I think we're running a little bit of

763
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:24,529
time

764
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:27,579
so sometimes it can damage

765
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:31,769
the locker little bit and

766
00:53:31,769 --> 00:53:35,960
there's a group going on scholer that
will prevent the mark from vending

767
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:39,180
so if you can see it but these are
actually glue gun

768
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,359
sticks and if you cut them in half

769
00:53:42,359 --> 00:53:47,640
and to glue them the group free from the
mark from

770
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,868
from venting especially if sure that
it's here

771
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:53,869
is completely remove and only the
plastic

772
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:57,150
of grandchildren there

773
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:00,299
if you become friends with you Mark

774
00:54:00,299 --> 00:54:03,660
they can cut 2999 piece what they are
called

775
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,529
monkeys

776
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,850
you can also you know take an existing
key

777
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,850
and just file it down yourself you know
just put the key in a vise

778
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:15,850
go down just estimate how

779
00:54:15,850 --> 00:54:20,200
you need to go the problem that you
think you would run into is that

780
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,290
you get out of alignment a little bit to
the left to the right

781
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:27,300
that's not necessary because these key
self-aligned the

782
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,730
binge in the lock are really hard the
metal of the key is very soft

783
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,330
to if you hit it a few times and you're
not completely aligned

784
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,700
the been to make an impression in

785
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,950
the key and the key will align itself

786
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:45,470
and you know it's it's relatively simple

787
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,750
to do it the industry

788
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,830
try to come up with some things what do
you think Mike should I

789
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:58,130
from some looks on stage few people ok

790
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:02,250
yes I'll just show you would bumping
looks right like in the real world on

791
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:09,250
that document

792
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,480
okay here's our first 999

793
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,950
it's from a work that has difficult
keyway

794
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:49,580
might be able to see its

795
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,740
trust me when I say two QN June

796
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:59,320
but you can see by the key itself that
there's many groups on the

797
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:04,520
making it very difficult I inserted into
the lock

798
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:10,290
I hope you can see that there still is
some playoff push it in

799
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:15,450
issued now

800
00:56:15,450 --> 00:56:22,450
I think that tomahawk and I'm going to
it and it's over

801
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,530
hi I think by now you understand

802
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:38,280
what got the industry you know

803
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,069
noticed or because a this actually
applies to

804
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:46,990
very wide range locks I'm gonna try one
more

805
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:53,200
fences you sir dimple lock

806
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:00,200
it's got 15 bees got 5 pins from three
different sizes

807
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:02,990
and in theory to go just

808
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:09,990
so

809
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:18,100
notices 15 p.m. temple of mark is gonna

810
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:28,120
talk about other locks a.m. also marks
with

811
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:33,319
you know half move the ball locking
mechanisms for instance this

812
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,550
lockers got 5 46

813
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:39,600
straight teens but is also got a very
simple

814
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,980
sidebar mechanism by the way this is a
very old

815
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:47,440
markets not be produced anymore people a
great the lock

816
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:52,150
long time ago but its a good example on

817
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:56,120
you know why it is good that they
actually operate lock

818
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,480
now if you wanna learn about pumping you
know go down to auction

819
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,580
pic village and Leslie

820
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,910
you know but you bump your inbox you can
test it yourself

821
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:10,420
but this I think this is for smokers

822
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:17,420
now

823
00:58:25,779 --> 00:58:28,359
okay hopefully 19 have computer problems

824
00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:34,170
I like to make a few comments first of
all

825
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:37,569
I am I'm really here to talk to you know
I'm as

826
00:58:37,569 --> 00:58:41,538
I think the bio says I'm a lawyer but I
also do a lot of security work around

827
00:58:41,539 --> 00:58:42,089
the world

828
00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:46,680
and I deal with the from covert methods
event-free

829
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:50,579
I work with us a row manufactures and
I'm

830
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:54,279
government organizations and I do a lot
of training

831
00:58:54,279 --> 00:58:57,950
and I do it deal with the legal aspects
of all this and

832
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:04,279
at the end of the day I'm this all looks
good I'm here to bring a reality this

833
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:07,650
as far as what the real threat level
Wales I

834
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:11,799
you may wish to go on our website and
it's also

835
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:16,029
we have all a very solemn white papers
on our website but also

836
00:59:16,029 --> 00:59:19,200
I decided I when I was in Cologne in
March to sit down

837
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,619
and really analyze the threat level that
bumping

838
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:25,829
presents

839
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:29,069
I'm this is all for now is

840
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:34,109
affecting about 95 percent of the pin
tumbler locks in the world I'm

841
00:59:34,109 --> 00:59:37,509
some high security locks we'll talk
about that

842
00:59:37,509 --> 00:59:41,950
the industry is paying attention this is
not been a big issue in the United

843
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:43,999
States yet it will be I think

844
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:50,999
and during my presentation during my
presentation all tell you why

845
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:58,940
that this pumping problem affects
millions of people in america directly

846
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:02,650
as as to their information security

847
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,819
I the the more

848
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:09,719
Larry talk to her a very talk about
sports lockpicking group they really

849
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:11,509
haven't taken off in America yet

850
01:00:11,509 --> 01:00:15,619
and I i get interviewed in the media
quite a bit and asked about this

851
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:21,150
I'm my attitude is are much different
from most to the locksmith

852
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:25,430
for fashion and that is I believe that
the more

853
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:30,509
diverse group of people are looking at
mechanical locks as well as software the

854
01:00:30,509 --> 01:00:31,150
better

855
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,940
I'm you can only help improve the
products

856
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:39,979
I the manufacturers that are making 4
lakhs a reason open locks

857
01:00:39,979 --> 01:00:43,599
they should either be forced to fix some
or the public should respond by not

858
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:44,229
buying

859
01:00:44,229 --> 01:00:48,430
everybody needs to understand and that's
really why I'm

860
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:51,519
appear today you folks

861
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:55,489
and especially those of you that have
it. responsibility which is going on to

862
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:57,269
the physical security area

863
01:00:57,269 --> 01:01:02,099
you need to understand the risks so that
you can make your

864
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:08,099
own risk assessment and decision whether
these locks offer or provide enough

865
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:09,539
security for your

866
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:13,289
environment and that's really what all
this is about all these demonstrations

867
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:14,079
are great

868
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:20,059
but the you should carry way one thing
mostly these locks the lower level locks

869
01:01:20,059 --> 01:01:20,859
are really

870
01:01:20,859 --> 01:01:25,640
not secure and so if you understand that
we've done our job today

871
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,640
so today we're gonna talk briefly about
pumping technique the background in

872
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:31,430
theory

873
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:35,099
what is the threat to security I

874
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:40,430
it this is not an obscure issue this is
not a theoretical or a laboratory issue

875
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,979
it is real world in Europe it's
attracted a lot of attention I suspect

876
01:01:43,979 --> 01:01:45,170
it will in america

877
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:49,960
I'm what secure what is not the legal
issues all address briefly

878
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,469
and a real-world case example that may
surprise everyone

879
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:57,140
up bumping is what I term a new

880
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:00,558
old threat I'm it's been known for

881
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,640
at least 25 years I am learn bumping up
in Denmark many years ago

882
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,989
I lot of the locksmiths up there used to
but they used it in a different

883
01:02:09,989 --> 01:02:14,029
procedure at first it was called
wrapping and what that man is the

884
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:16,549
locksmith would take a walk on his
workbench

885
01:02:16,549 --> 01:02:19,749
slamming on the bench while putting a
little bit attention

886
01:02:19,749 --> 01:02:25,359
on the backup log in the open and so
from Napa locksmiths in Denmark figured

887
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,130
out that if they put a key and

888
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:30,359
with all the cuts cut as low as they can
be

889
01:02:30,359 --> 01:02:33,509
which which translated to a code

890
01:02:33,509 --> 01:02:37,359
9 yet understand every manufacture
assigns

891
01:02:37,359 --> 01:02:41,848
def coding to each of the different pin
lengths are available that make up what

892
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:43,190
your key looks like

893
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:47,989
so the deeper scold on the the primary
lock in Denmark with a9

894
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:51,170
hence the term 999 key

895
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:55,690
saw this for 25 years in Denmark was
known but

896
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:58,949
nobody really paid any attention to it
including myself in in the first

897
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:01,039
addition second dish in my book

898
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:05,039
it had very short mention it was detail
but not a lot

899
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,279
then came the folks in Germany and the
Netherlands

900
01:03:08,279 --> 01:03:11,349
in about 2004 and

901
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:14,930
I all of a sudden this sort of I think
our first it was on television in

902
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:15,749
Germany

903
01:03:15,749 --> 01:03:16,870
and then

904
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:21,569
very well sent to all picked up on a and
really started looking at this issue

905
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,970
what came out of that is east new
serious threat

906
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:29,530
based on about three hundred and fifty
year old law of physics

907
01:03:29,530 --> 01:03:33,450
its it and as I said it's not popular in
the US but it's getting there

908
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:37,660
the Netherlands tasks is very said the
consumer reporting agency in the

909
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,740
Netherlands are the most popular

910
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,390
decided finally I last year

911
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:47,710
to tasked about 70 different
manufactures and locks in the

912
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:49,660
Netherlands to see how secure

913
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,799
or how in secure they were well

914
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,320
and and I looked at the tests they ran
they were valid

915
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,610
and they were comprehensive I and and

916
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:02,730
they were very systematic they weren't
skewed they were

917
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,760
waited they bought locks are off the
shelf they didn't get them from the

918
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,710
manufactures

919
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:10,170
so they were sure they were dealing with
what the public was dealing with

920
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:14,320
in March their report was released and
then subsequent to that we released our

921
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,320
white paper

922
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,680
as far as detail in the real security
threat

923
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,770
from the legal and technical standpoint
I the Netherlands

924
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:26,120
IR tasks really validated bumping

925
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:31,580
as a security threat and y'all need
understand that this is in large measure

926
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:36,310
due to the work that tool very well as
Han Fei in a number others a

927
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:41,040
folks and I've dealt with overseas they
really promoted this issue they went to

928
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,250
the manufactures

929
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,670
a lot of the manufactures really didn't
get it

930
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:48,710
they didn't believe it they didn't
understand that they didn't think it was

931
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:49,450
a problem

932
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:54,740
they do now I Bob bumping poses a
serious threat to security in the United

933
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:55,330
States

934
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:59,670
it affects millions have locks it
affects critical infrastructure locks

935
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:01,210
that are often protected

936
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:04,290
fight in secure locks I am

937
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:07,750
I would venture to say the handbook that

938
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:11,920
Homeland Security just-released with
abouts

939
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:18,550
70,000 locations that they deem as prime
targets most to these are protected

940
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:22,630
buy inexpensive five or six pin tumbler
locks it can be bombed open

941
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,680
this really needs to get fixed arm

942
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:29,100
your primary privacy and communications

943
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:33,000
because a bumping can be a risk of going
to that in a little while

944
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,190
and there are for you.it people as you
know there are federal laws regarding

945
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,950
are the protection of information and
secure assets

946
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,810
they can be violated if you don't have
the right kinda lock specifically

947
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:50,170
hip-hop and the I actually sarbanes act

948
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,250
are pumping critical issues that you
need to take away with

949
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:57,910
ninety-five percent have the locks in
this country I think ur phone will

950
01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:01,900
because we use pin tumbler locks
predominantly in the United States

951
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:06,460
everyone who relies on locks needs to
understand

952
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:10,660
so you can make your own security
assessment and there are legal issues of

953
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:12,760
liability involved as well as

954
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,350
obviously security issues so why is
bumping a threat

955
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:20,509
I it's the simplest form of bypass

956
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,620
there are a number of methods are
opening boxes

957
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,440
very well as the draft I the the the
primary

958
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,440
methods are picking impression and
decoding

959
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:35,390
master key extrapolation which was
delved into a couple years ago

960
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:40,230
and then there's bumping and I just
include bumping is another motive bypass

961
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:41,620
but it's more dangerous

962
01:06:41,620 --> 01:06:45,150
because of my 3t to our rule

963
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:50,260
and Mattias all locks and their security
arrests asked by

964
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:54,310
the manufactures and underwriters
laboratory VDS in Germany all the rating

965
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,270
organizations

966
01:06:55,270 --> 01:07:00,730
they're really rated in terms I love
might 3t to our rule and that is how

967
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:01,810
much training

968
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:04,880
time and what kinda tools are required

969
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,970
to open the lock and what's the
repeatability

970
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:13,080
and the reliability up the process in
the case of pumping it meets all these

971
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,590
criteria as for

972
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:19,680
most of the lower quality pin tumbler
locks in fact even some of the higher

973
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:21,410
quality locks with

974
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:26,150
prior intelligence can be open so
there's two primary threat levels

975
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:31,740
regarding bumping one is if you have
system intelligence and two

976
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:37,200
the availability of keys now let's talk
about the availability of keys first

977
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,610
you wanna make a bomb key or more
importantly you're worried about your

978
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:45,150
facility being compromised because
somebody's gonna bump open locks

979
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:48,870
how difficult is it to get a key not
really

980
01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:54,020
the even sometimes a bit too restricted
key way that makes it more difficult

981
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:58,600
but let's take our a common lock like
you buy a hardware store

982
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,900
quickset Dexter whenever I

983
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:04,990
the problem is that these locks are sold
everywhere

984
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:09,040
and a few can match the key way and buy
a box at the hardware store from a

985
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,410
jobber from a locksmith

986
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,700
from Home Depot you can't turn any

987
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:17,010
key into a bomb key that's the problem

988
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,170
and it's not difficult to do it very
didn't demonstrate

989
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:25,140
on appear today how to make bombs keys I
just actually shot a very detailed video

990
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,010
Woodbury in Amsterdam

991
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:30,950
it's on the the next addition evolve
Moxie from security

992
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:34,000
that we really went into this but the
bottom line is

993
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,130
a few dollar fine all the keys and they
can be modified to become a funky

994
01:08:39,130 --> 01:08:42,870
that becomes a serious threat if you
have

995
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:45,930
the key there's a real problem and

996
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:50,510
and then we have system intelligent
system intelligence means do you know

997
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,140
anything about the locks

998
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:55,240
your going to open a or going to be
opened

999
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:58,899
and had a time this becomes very
relevant

1000
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:02,240
when you're talking about some high
security locks

1001
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:07,589
arm the locks that use sidebars such as
medical primus and

1002
01:09:07,589 --> 01:09:12,540
Osama I'm they all have predefined side
bar codes

1003
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,930
in the system some of these locks

1004
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:20,109
can be bombed open even the higher
security locks

1005
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:23,390
if you have the sidebar call and I need
y'all

1006
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:26,430
understand this I medical

1007
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:29,460
it probably is the leader in the high
security lock

1008
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,410
field in America they the literally on
about eighty percent of the market in

1009
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:36,460
this country their overseas but
america's our main markets

1010
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:39,649
they manufacture in virginia they are
actuellement locks

1011
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:43,349
I'm sure most of you have heard a rumor
from know you're with them

1012
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:48,060
these are the peons that lift and the
rotate in order to open the lock

1013
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:52,370
well some of these locks can be bombed
open

1014
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:55,450
if you have the sidebar hold or the

1015
01:09:55,450 --> 01:10:01,000
angle cuts have the keys if you do not
have that prior intelligence you will

1016
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,520
not come home in these locks

1017
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,220
now are OSA in some models that's also
true

1018
01:10:08,220 --> 01:10:11,930
she like Primus is probably the number
two

1019
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:16,270
high security lock vendor in the United
States there a huge company

1020
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:19,780
I have not been able bomb open the
Primus

1021
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:23,290
because love the tolerance is in the way
its manufacture

1022
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:27,420
that doesn't mean some day they may not
be bombed open but presently

1023
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:30,570
we have not been able to open a arm so

1024
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:34,599
we have threat level 1 we have no
intelligence

1025
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,690
we have no information about the
locketts a standard pin tumbler lock we

1026
01:10:38,690 --> 01:10:39,560
walk up to it

1027
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,190
we we sticky and it's been cut to a
bumpy we open a

1028
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:46,230
with prior intelligence you know
something about the system and you may

1029
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:48,150
be able to get an open

1030
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:51,860
I threat level to producing bump keys

1031
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,460
you can do it from blanks you can do it
from cut keys

1032
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,890
or you can now buy pre-cut bomb keys on
the Internet

1033
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:03,610
now my attitude about this is a lawyer I
Percy and the

1034
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:07,030
security person I perceive this is a
real threat

1035
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:12,500
I for legitimate locksmiths for
researchers for security analysts righty

1036
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:15,350
folks are analyzing security okay

1037
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:20,390
by the wholesale sale a bump keys that
are pre-cut for specific key ways

1038
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:24,200
that may become a serious problem covert
methods of entry

1039
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,490
and security ratings as I mentioned

1040
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:31,969
we're talking about special tools
training experience in the time required

1041
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:35,130
the easier that becomes obviously

1042
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,260
the higher the threat level so again

1043
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:42,030
what is security in a lock in a perfect
world

1044
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:45,440
no lockerbie open without the right here
Kong

1045
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:50,490
unfortunately we don't have a perfect
world the reality levels of difficulty a

1046
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,750
resistance to force in covert and free

1047
01:11:52,750 --> 01:11:57,260
techniques it depends on the type of
lock it depends on secondary locking

1048
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:00,040
systems and it depends on security
enhancements

1049
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,590
such as sidebars so you need to pay
attention and let me tell you

1050
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:07,570
you get what you pay for and locks if
you think you can protect assets

1051
01:12:07,570 --> 01:12:10,900
for a twenty thirty dollar lock fifteen
dollar lock

1052
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:14,420
you're wrong they can be open and you
need understand that

1053
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:18,150
saw as I said pumping as a method of
covert and free

1054
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,219
I I think this power points gonna be up

1055
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:25,250
published online: so I'm not going all
over this I'm you folks can read it

1056
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:27,110
later that are interested in it but

1057
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:31,040
bumping is a very effective method of
covert and free

1058
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:35,120
and again it was developed in Denmark
about twenty-five years ago

1059
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:39,349
I am but actually it was developed about
three hundred fifty years ago

1060
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:44,750
by Sir Isaac Newton who through his
third law of motion for every action

1061
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:46,970
there is an equal and opposite reaction

1062
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:51,610
pin tumbler locks really had not been
invented in 1650 or thereabouts

1063
01:12:51,610 --> 01:12:54,660
when when Sir Isaac Newton came up with
this theory but that

1064
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:58,250
is what bumping is all about when you
when you

1065
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:02,380
apply energy to the bottom PN the top
ten moves

1066
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:06,820
an if you time it right the top pins in
the bottom pencil split

1067
01:13:06,820 --> 01:13:10,509
long enough for you to rotate the plugin
open the lock

1068
01:13:10,510 --> 01:13:14,970
so they're six critical elements the key
with the correct key way

1069
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:18,120
all other the depths are cut to Nine's

1070
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:22,500
you have a bumping technique you have a
method to apply energy the peons

1071
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,530
for the tomahawk work and Pearson's to
all

1072
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:29,670
I you have to work and timing which
means you have to put to work on the

1073
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:30,150
clock

1074
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:34,220
and hit it or hate it and then put to
work on the clock it depends on the lock

1075
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:39,330
I'm and its all about training in the
Netherlands experiments are tests that

1076
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:41,680
consumers reports did

1077
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:46,160
they showed a video to out the part is
the lady

1078
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,510
participants in open the locks the video
was a short video of the internet and

1079
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,220
less than an hour and sometimes a lot
last

1080
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:58,840
they were opening box this is a problem

1081
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,570
okay so number one key with the correct
key way as I said

1082
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:07,710
commercials stores locksmiths I would
take issue with very

1083
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:12,320
you're going to find very few if any
locksmiths that will cut you a key

1084
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:15,440
bytecode all mines must they know you

1085
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:19,210
and you're a security person or have a
need to know

1086
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:23,970
there are 0 guidelines for the associate
locksmiths America

1087
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:28,910
that would from him in a locksmith not
only from cutting up knowingly cutting a

1088
01:14:28,910 --> 01:14:29,280
bomb

1089
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:32,599
key but also from discussing this with
you

1090
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,180
or showing you what the vulnerability
years

1091
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,360
I happen to disagree with some %uh this
I think that the end user the consumer

1092
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,500
should be making their own security
decisions

1093
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:47,350
I don't think the locksmith ought to be
in that position to be making your

1094
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,940
decisions for you

1095
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:52,590
the ought to give you the information so
you can make an intelligent

1096
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:57,040
and knowing decision okay so then we
want to cut all the key the

1097
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,880
the cuts to a number nine depth is shown
in this key

1098
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,200
these can be cut by hand these can be
cut by Coone

1099
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:07,889
for again they're being offered on the
internet now

1100
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:12,260
these are asbury showed you this will
def better graphics

1101
01:15:12,260 --> 01:15:16,610
I these are different varieties a bump
keys they all open locks

1102
01:15:16,610 --> 01:15:21,509
I we have our high security lock over on
the way after we have a dimple lock

1103
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:25,420
right and bottom okay bumping technique

1104
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:30,090
two techniques for bumping either
withdraw the old style that I learned

1105
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:33,930
up in Denmark you withdraw the key one
Kat

1106
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:37,820
and you put a little to work on it and
you strike it

1107
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:41,690
and the locker open the new method that
was developed in Europe

1108
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:45,020
by to all in all the other folks

1109
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:49,050
Asbury said I call it and referred to in
my learned through the negative shoulder

1110
01:15:49,050 --> 01:15:49,830
method

1111
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:54,320
you trim about a quarter millimeter of
the shoulder so the key can move forward

1112
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,490
slightly in the lock

1113
01:15:55,490 --> 01:16:00,000
and NAF to apply energy to the sides a
verrrrry p.m.

1114
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:06,430
an the my graphic I'm again just like
berries this is the normal lock state

1115
01:16:06,430 --> 01:16:11,200
when energy is applied the pins are
split

1116
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,490
and again the theory evolve this this is
um

1117
01:16:14,490 --> 01:16:18,280
wanna my associates are more shelved 11
Israel

1118
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:21,960
who was one of the cow founders Co
inventors have multi Lockwood very

1119
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,240
popular lock

1120
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:26,480
manufacturer in europe are the awesome
ABLOY group

1121
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,680
he did a demonstration and he patented
Appian that will prevent bumping

1122
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:34,430
and basically what this shows is how the
pins with its

1123
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:37,740
up in the upper right hand corner and

1124
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:41,099
with his pee in they stay together so
you can open

1125
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:44,920
the method of applying energy to the key

1126
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:49,370
I the original Tom Harkin can pearson's
to rollerball shown here

1127
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:53,230
pearson's is the blue one I'm they both
work

1128
01:16:53,230 --> 01:16:56,810
equally well I frankly a screwdriver
handle

1129
01:16:56,810 --> 01:17:01,790
work that's the problem are you don't
need a special tool the bomb pope

1130
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:02,830
unlocks

1131
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:06,260
and again twerkin timing song arm

1132
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:10,550
you apply an urgency to the key and you
open the lock

1133
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:13,730
I were I did a television interview

1134
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:18,740
I almost two years ago on the house with
a reporter who knew absolutely nothing I

1135
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:21,130
handed her a six pin lock

1136
01:17:21,130 --> 01:17:24,970
this the standard La Cantera bomb
drawing a key she opened it in about

1137
01:17:24,970 --> 01:17:28,170
five seconds she had no clue how she did
it

1138
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:32,600
but she did and Mac in my state that got
everybody's attention and that

1139
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,730
is the essence have the security risk
again

1140
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:40,270
bumping its easy to learn arm training
in less than an hour

1141
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:44,160
it's very easy are just over Cambridge
the director the computer security lab

1142
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,440
Ross Anderson

1143
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,270
had never bomb to lock in his life he
wrote for all view that on

1144
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:52,930
are from me with security engineering on
the software side

1145
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:57,750
he runs the lab at Cambridge he had
never open the lock I handed him a tool

1146
01:17:57,750 --> 01:18:01,850
open at once formed and he opened it no
problem

1147
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:07,120
arm bumping demonstration very wells did
that so we don't need to do that

1148
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,910
pin tumbler locks that cannot be bomb
open

1149
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:14,360
as I mentioned are some side far locks

1150
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,719
some awesome locks arm those

1151
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:20,820
like Primus we believe there are other
locks

1152
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:27,030
the Tom the FR 3k ass is an excellent
example with sliders it can't be open

1153
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:32,800
I am the matter call unless you have the
side bar code you will not open it in

1154
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,850
even with the side bar code I don't
think it's a repeatable

1155
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:41,290
or reliable process I get a lot of
emails just like buried us from around

1156
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:42,300
the world

1157
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:46,040
I am there are prime lock to attack

1158
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,410
arms yes some have been opened I've open
some

1159
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:55,019
again it's not in my view repeatable
reliable bypass technique with their

1160
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:56,270
Saunders

1161
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:59,850
I'm this is just to show you are the
differences

1162
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:03,890
this is an Osama and basically it shows
the side

1163
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:07,390
cuts on the PM's I'm this is the second
set

1164
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:11,870
a fingerprint fingerprints as you can
see in the upper right hand corner

1165
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,120
that interlock so you have to engage
both

1166
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:20,250
on this is the ArcLight Primus the
difference between of Sun Primus

1167
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:24,320
although it's the same inventor boll
weevil in are Sweden

1168
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,940
the difference is significant for
bumping I

1169
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:32,570
whether intended or not the sphincter
friends on the Primus

1170
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:36,219
need the people lifted and rotated and
so

1171
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:41,010
this presents a significant obstacle to
pumping as I said we haven't got 'em

1172
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,120
open yet

1173
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:46,640
maybe my personal very thanks yes I
think no

1174
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:49,840
and I probably done more work on primus
and he have

1175
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:54,990
I'm and and so it's one of the more
secure locks the eva three Ks on austria

1176
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:58,830
isn't actual locketts not available in
the United States yet

1177
01:19:58,830 --> 01:20:03,100
widely available in europe because it's
a slider design

1178
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:06,610
it is bombproof guaranteed absolutely

1179
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:11,480
it may be subject to other forms of my
past but it's not gonna be bumped open

1180
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:15,210
generic locks that cannot be bumped open
worded

1181
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:19,340
lever way for India's in combination
locks you're not gonna bump from open

1182
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:21,460
because you don't have two pins

1183
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:26,340
in the PM stack display at are using
Newton's technique

1184
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,140
there are complicating factors I with
regard to bumping

1185
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:36,330
I and I don't need to go into these but
there are several factors that may make

1186
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,370
bumping

1187
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:41,940
difficult if not impossible it really
depends on the lock

1188
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:45,310
the environmental conditions the
conditions and pins not so much the

1189
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:46,330
springs

1190
01:20:46,330 --> 01:20:49,450
I there's a lot of factors but at the
end of the day

1191
01:20:49,450 --> 01:20:53,660
were open about 95 percent of the locks
so that should give everybody a cause

1192
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:55,019
for concern

1193
01:20:55,020 --> 01:20:59,120
if you folks have investigative
responsibility and you have a mysterious

1194
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,290
disappearance

1195
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,430
the problem with bumping years there's
not generally

1196
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:08,610
generally no external evidence a man
free

1197
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:13,500
I it affects if if you're working a case
where they're just plain old pin tumbler

1198
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:15,610
locks you need to pay attention

1199
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:18,790
to the potential the pumping is involved

1200
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:22,990
I and there cannot be a sidebar if
there's a sidebar on the walk back and

1201
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:24,929
make pumping more difficult

1202
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:28,120
I am if that's a common keyway

1203
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:32,210
that will increase your susceptibility
to bumping and what's the availability

1204
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:34,370
of blacks

1205
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:37,500
now you may ask what about security PM's

1206
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:42,020
are one about restrict intersectional
key ways what about the number of pins

1207
01:21:42,020 --> 01:21:45,810
and what about removal for locks like
cop on bass

1208
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:49,530
they don't have any real significant
impact on bumping

1209
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:53,370
doesn't matter whether they have
security pins restricted or sectional

1210
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:54,340
key ways

1211
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:57,340
generally the number appeared and or if
it's removable

1212
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:01,960
for they can all be bombed open and as I
said if it's got a sidebar you need to

1213
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,950
know the sidebar Kong

1214
01:22:03,950 --> 01:22:08,830
was the walk bomb again it definitely
was not bomb

1215
01:22:08,830 --> 01:22:13,050
don't mine if it was a magnetic lock
such as the ever

1216
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,470
MCS your that they're not susceptible
the bumping

1217
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:20,650
again if it's awarded way for lever
number dis time were

1218
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:26,560
you can open okay other legal issues

1219
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,390
if you find somebody with a bumpy or if
you're stopped with the key that looks

1220
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:31,810
like a bomb key

1221
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:34,940
it does not necessarily have to have

1222
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:38,640
all 9 cuts the deeper Scott

1223
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:42,050
you can actually have a bump key with
eight counts nine cuts

1224
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:47,510
maybe a zero cut it depends where the
the pin tumblers are in the law

1225
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:52,620
I am it definitely won't work if it
doesn't fit the keyway

1226
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:56,490
I if it's an original key and the code
numbers different

1227
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:01,590
then is on the than is actually cut you
could have a problem where I'm going to

1228
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:02,420
areas

1229
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:05,780
with this arm bomb keys

1230
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:08,900
are just like walk px as far as the

1231
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:13,650
the light legal our requirements our
possession of burglary tools

1232
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,270
and a tomahawk would be equivalent to a
torque wrench

1233
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:20,600
for lockpicking saw I

1234
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,360
if you are caught in possession of 1999

1235
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:28,370
key and the circumstances indicate that
you're trying to open locks that you

1236
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:30,040
don't have authorities open

1237
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:33,930
you have a problem I it's called
possession of burglary tools and

1238
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:36,540
basically every jurisdiction in the
country

1239
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:40,660
and so you need to pay attention to that
I am

1240
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:44,510
an a-bomb key is very distinguishable
from most normal keys

1241
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:47,800
again those statutes reefer to

1242
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,780
our circumstances and can in 10 p.m. for

1243
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:56,889
are so the burglary are statutes would
apply to bump keys

1244
01:23:56,890 --> 01:24:00,800
I are any regular key can be made into a
bumpy

1245
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,510
the interesting legal issue is if you
have a bump key that actually opens your

1246
01:24:05,510 --> 01:24:07,490
door lock

1247
01:24:07,490 --> 01:24:11,280
are that poses more of a complicated
problem but if it can be shown that

1248
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,370
it was not produce that way then you
have an issue

1249
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:18,849
I'm there are some defenses I that I
don't really need to go into

1250
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,730
but there would be some defenses to
these issues but not particularly

1251
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:23,440
relevant today

1252
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:27,630
federal statutes when everybody asks me
about what about sending

1253
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:32,590
bump key through the mail through
interstate commerce on FedEx and DHL

1254
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:37,650
I am their are federal postal
regulations and statutes

1255
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:40,760
under Title 39 3002

1256
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:46,370
eighty and title 18 which is the federal
criminal Kong

1257
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:49,790
these statues make it the only goal to
introduce

1258
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,160
bypass tools in the interstate commerce

1259
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,460
the statute was written about seventy
years ago

1260
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:01,900
they didn't know about monkeys and as a
matter fact the federal statute

1261
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,920
specifically exempts bump keys

1262
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,080
from introduction in the interstate
commerce

1263
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:11,960
so there is no present prohibition

1264
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:16,460
as to the introduction a bumpy sending
them through FedEx DHL the mail

1265
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:19,969
and one postal statue covers all that
but it does not

1266
01:25:19,969 --> 01:25:23,290
in my view an interpretation and I've
talked to some

1267
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:26,450
federal prosecutors it doesn't appear

1268
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:30,330
to apply at this point to bump keys well
it in the future

1269
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:33,590
I suspect that we are so let's talk now

1270
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:37,510
for a couple minutes about the real
world bumping and how it affects you

1271
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:41,670
and your business's and your privacy

1272
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:47,210
the post office the United States Post
Office in mailboxes xn a rental boxes

1273
01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:48,250
worldwide

1274
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:51,570
are cheap pin tumbler locks

1275
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:55,599
the in March we released a security
alert after working with the Postal

1276
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,130
Inspection Service for four months on
this issue

1277
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:04,690
I'm we released a security alert warning
everybody that if you have he rented

1278
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:08,820
mailbox it is at extreme risk bumping

1279
01:26:08,820 --> 01:26:12,080
I'm we estimate at least 5 million

1280
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,519
postal boxes no I'm not talking about
what's on your her

1281
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,440
side that's a different issue i'm
talking about. in the post office

1282
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:24,810
were in mailboxes X Adara the integrity
and security of the mailman knows boxes

1283
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:25,930
is at risk

1284
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:29,840
and in all of those facilities there's
virtually no

1285
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:34,090
perimeter security some other post
offices have video cameras were there is

1286
01:26:34,090 --> 01:26:36,270
blind spots

1287
01:26:36,270 --> 01:26:40,700
in mailboxes except for which was
acquired by UPS about I think for five

1288
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,050
years ago

1289
01:26:42,050 --> 01:26:47,660
arm the lock the doors at night but then
they give all their customers the keys

1290
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:52,430
and do they use high security locks for
electronic locks and have audit trails

1291
01:26:52,430 --> 01:26:57,420
no we wouldn't want to do that we use
standard keys that you can take and

1292
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,090
duplicate and pass out to whoever

1293
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:03,260
and they don't recall the keys saw

1294
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:06,740
in Sioux Falls where I live I went
around in a box

1295
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:10,139
from mailboxes X at around then I shot a
video

1296
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:14,040
opening arm both the postal service

1297
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:17,790
and mailboxes ex-senator I have this
problem

1298
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:23,780
I and and everybody that has those boxes
is at risk they think they're secure

1299
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:28,219
they are not the post office is working
on the problem

1300
01:27:28,219 --> 01:27:32,770
to my knowledge and I just spoke with
the manufacture of mailboxes cetera

1301
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:35,540
locks this past weekend at Las Vegas

1302
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:39,450
they're not concerned about the problem
saw

1303
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:44,980
this is the mailbox ik several lakhs
these locks are manufactured in China

1304
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:49,980
for last than a dollar this is what your
security is worth

1305
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:53,130
at mail box looks at a rock in my view I

1306
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:57,150
dollar this is what the bomb key looks
like

1307
01:27:57,150 --> 01:28:00,250
bill open the mailbox et cetera

1308
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:03,430
locks this is a cheap Chinese

1309
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:07,920
manufactured locketts a US manufacturer
they do all their work in China

1310
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,530
it's not the manufacturer's fault
because the manufacturer also makes the

1311
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:13,059
postal service locks

1312
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:16,730
which are a lot better than these better
still not secure

1313
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:21,460
saw one dollar last made in China
several manufacturers are making these

1314
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:22,270
locks

1315
01:28:22,270 --> 01:28:26,230
their 5 p.m. really really cheap locks

1316
01:28:26,230 --> 01:28:31,210
and mailboxes X at her house 5500
locations worldwide

1317
01:28:31,210 --> 01:28:35,570
saw the security response from mailboxes
ex-senator I spoke with their chief for

1318
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:36,530
security

1319
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:39,620
he instantly got he said all

1320
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:44,330
this could be a real problem but when
their PR people got a whole the vet

1321
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:48,320
after hours on television in my state
their comment was

1322
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,370
it's not a problem we know our customers

1323
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:55,400
now works and and so only those
customers that they know

1324
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:58,790
would be opening the mail boxes and not
anybody else

1325
01:28:58,790 --> 01:29:03,519
and are we locked the doors at night but
of course we give everybody a key than

1326
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,210
anybody can copy

1327
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:09,200
saw that was mailbox 6 enter a statement

1328
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,600
if you want more security are these
mailboxes you should demand

1329
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,110
high-security locks that Postal Service

1330
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:21,339
is working on it I it's going to cost a
lot of money there's thirty eight

1331
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:24,050
thousand-plus post offices

1332
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:28,100
and saw it's a real problem but they're
gonna they're gonna work on its own

1333
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:32,240
if this video Iran's this is the video
that we did in Sioux Falls

1334
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:37,910
with mailboxes ex-senator and of course
it's knocked in a run

1335
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:43,430
okay well thats actual

1336
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:46,840
I well so much for are Lenovo

1337
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,840
laptop

1338
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,490
I which by the way is a brand new laptop

1339
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:57,230
thank you very much okay so now we're
frozen saw

1340
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:01,840
I

1341
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:04,860
are no I don't think so I've been I fact
I'm

1342
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:08,230
having a conference call Monday with win
over as chief tech support because all

1343
01:30:08,230 --> 01:30:09,290
the issues

1344
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:12,780
arm so maybe now they'll get I'll at any
rate

1345
01:30:12,780 --> 01:30:16,090
it's a nice green screen I the bottom
line is

1346
01:30:16,090 --> 01:30:20,160
I walked into mailboxes X at a rock an
anime

1347
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,420
literally two seconds opened my mailbox

1348
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:28,590
I the the mailbox the postal service we
did the same thing

1349
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:32,170
are with the postal inspector and by the
way

1350
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:35,780
the the restricted key ways for the
Postal Service

1351
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:39,019
we bought on email

1352
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:43,219
I there's feather there's federal
prohibitions on distributing or doing

1353
01:30:43,219 --> 01:30:44,850
anything with these keys

1354
01:30:44,850 --> 01:30:49,080
their are other key ways that are sold
the open these locks which complicates

1355
01:30:49,080 --> 01:30:50,040
the problem

1356
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,410
but the keys am the locks are sold on
eBay

1357
01:30:53,410 --> 01:30:58,510
why because when military bases around
the world are shut down

1358
01:30:58,510 --> 01:31:02,790
everything a surplus so we sell the
mailboxes

1359
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,940
for everybody to buy and so

1360
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,940
again bumping from my standpoint

1361
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:12,260
is a significant threat you need to pay
attention to it

1362
01:31:12,260 --> 01:31:16,370
I berries gonna have a workshop with the
folks downstairs

1363
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:19,940
to so you can look at the problem
yourself I'm does anybody have any

1364
01:31:19,940 --> 01:31:24,330
questions before I give this back to
bury

1365
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:31,330
okay you alright right are questions

1366
01:31:33,449 --> 01:31:36,710
what naval legal ramifications of having
a lot think it

1367
01:31:36,710 --> 01:31:40,670
you said that there was the occasions
for having the funky but

1368
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:43,840
in some stage arm

1369
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:47,390
its possession of burglary tools but
honestly I've worked with a lot of the

1370
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:50,800
statutes I'm not giving you legal advice
but the bay

1371
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,690
the bottom line is you have to show
criminal intent you don't have a crime

1372
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:58,210
with a criminal intent and so if you're
at home picking locks your

1373
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:02,570
your office whenever I don't think it's
a problem yessir

1374
01:32:02,570 --> 01:32:05,690
you're talking about restricted key ways
in protecting

1375
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:09,890
infrastructure and environments want one
thing it's important to watch out for

1376
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:11,260
stolen keys

1377
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:15,219
because they can easily turn into a
pumpkin cheese and companies think

1378
01:32:15,219 --> 01:32:18,350
replacing the locks are going to you
know

1379
01:32:18,350 --> 01:32:21,420
are reeking of his gonna solve the
problem that's a really good point

1380
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:24,739
there ought to be and and and i've
covered in my book there's

1381
01:32:24,739 --> 01:32:29,320
there needs to be inventory control on
locks and keys are taken out of service

1382
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:33,599
and you need to account for all your
keys because any key and ago

1383
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:38,100
it's worse than that because iniki can
be turned into a bumpy but a lot of them

1384
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,790
can be used to extrapolate the top level
master key

1385
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:45,360
also which is a even a better track as a
via the key deer for Sony

1386
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:49,259
I don't need to worry about anything
else and a quick question about the

1387
01:32:49,260 --> 01:32:52,790
the Obama keys arm split top driver

1388
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:56,940
games I'll at the at two of them up
there that never drop down into the

1389
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:57,500
keyway

1390
01:32:57,500 --> 01:33:00,760
done see what I just transferred to the
top one you the school's

1391
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:05,980
where don't know still split next
question quickly cuz you're out I'm

1392
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:08,980
on with the bomb method

1393
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:13,610
is there any electronic detection in
this secondary security

1394
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:19,299
that's being manufactured detect that
not oh no not really glass break

1395
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,100
detector

1396
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,989
no for is there so nothing's it'd be
imparted to be virtually impossible

1397
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:26,650
unless you put a contact Mike on the
lock and then the the

1398
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:30,179
the false would be a real problem survey
seven of

1399
01:33:30,179 --> 01:33:34,060
um a another question for various have
you ever in Europe

1400
01:33:34,060 --> 01:33:39,510
or you ever seen a lot that when a
contractor or builder a house

1401
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:43,000
has a quote master and then when you

1402
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,449
take possession at the house you put a
key and your

1403
01:33:46,449 --> 01:33:50,900
quote-unquote key and you turn the key
resets the tumblers

1404
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:53,960
or is this just propaganda by the
builders

1405
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:58,560
where really actually has a master key
that just floating around I it's not

1406
01:33:58,560 --> 01:33:59,440
propaganda

1407
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:03,020
obvious call construction mastering and
basically you move a piano the way

1408
01:34:03,020 --> 01:34:03,750
forever

1409
01:34:03,750 --> 01:34:07,590
and then that construction master should
never work again

1410
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:12,139
okay period yessir next Irun

1411
01:34:12,139 --> 01:34:16,550
I get two questions on is there a
commercial tool that uses the bonding

1412
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:17,170
method

1413
01:34:17,170 --> 01:34:20,260
that is used by locksmiths other than
than creating an 999

1414
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:23,480
key now 999 t it's easiest

1415
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:27,150
but aside from that like an actual
industrial tool that you can use

1416
01:34:27,150 --> 01:34:30,340
no the the I mean a 999

1417
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:34,150
is what it is surely some okay well
we'll talk about that the

1418
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:38,570
village in second of what about if 2
pins are magnetized

1419
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:42,500
very strong magnets it said kind of
which stem from separate

1420
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:46,870
I agree with you we've looked at it %uh
the problem is the magnetic material

1421
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:50,070
I believe there are some locks in europe
they're doing that right now okay thank

1422
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,429
you

1423
01:34:50,429 --> 01:34:54,120
next possible

1424
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:58,159
strong spring

1425
01:34:58,159 --> 01:35:01,630
spring doesn't seem to make a difference
it does it does

1426
01:35:01,630 --> 01:35:05,620
the the question was can you are stop a
lock from being opened by a stronger

1427
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:06,170
spring at

1428
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:10,969
doesn't seem to make a difference next
question if you

1429
01:35:10,969 --> 01:35:14,280
mushroom in there

1430
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:18,099
and use the bomb technique you notice
any difference

1431
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,989
if it works not hindered

1432
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:25,750
the microphone doesn't seem

1433
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:30,449
the other microphone doesn't seem to
work now it's just a matter of timing

1434
01:35:30,449 --> 01:35:34,130
so if you put tension on already and
then you start pumping

1435
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:37,810
then you know you might run into
problems but the way to

1436
01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:40,820
I bump into a refuge from being she said
you hated

1437
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:45,469
and a split second later you actually
tried to turn it so much

1438
01:35:45,469 --> 01:35:48,690
so regardless whether he had a mushroom
shaped

1439
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:55,690
doesn't matter this message matter ok
next maybe the justice in other forms

1440
01:35:56,060 --> 01:35:57,409
but I'm just wondering for barry

1441
01:35:57,409 --> 01:36:01,800
when you're undersea just you deluxe
very quickly what are you are you

1442
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:04,530
feeling for it are you hearing for when
it actually happens what are you

1443
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:05,699
listening for a feeling for

1444
01:36:05,699 --> 01:36:09,810
by nights it's regarding to bumping

1445
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:14,050
it's just the timing matter with with
other with a lock as well

1446
01:36:14,050 --> 01:36:15,560
that's just you know

1447
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,630
you get sensitive for feeling the lock
so it's not hearing

1448
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:25,739
it just feeling that's that's all our
bank

1449
01:36:25,739 --> 01:36:31,790
safety deposit boxes for mobile to
bombay not not not to use lever locks

1450
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:38,790
I think that's about it okay standing

1451
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:41,850
0 let's just say three more questions

1452
01:36:41,850 --> 01:36:45,719
okay um you love read on extract
extracting

1453
01:36:45,719 --> 01:36:51,239
master key is that is your technique to
that is a chance involved

1454
01:36:51,239 --> 01:36:56,150
this actually a good paper written on it
and

1455
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:59,239
its online so I will have to look up the
address

1456
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:05,409
I can't really two more

1457
01:37:05,409 --> 01:37:10,190
ok

1458
01:37:10,190 --> 01:37:12,300
thank you thanks to God
