16
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,789
science fiction

17
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,290
here in this room at 1700 so if you're
interested in

75

19
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,170
Carman talking about lifetimes a valid
during

20
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,070
RK her I I'm just a quick

21
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:26,600
show of hands like how many people could
confidently give a talk on churns life

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,570
just curious like the level of knowledge
okay I fear that's good

23
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,859
I'll it's not as nice that actually
people

24
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:37,240
have in a some interest in him I'm I
just thought it was really important

25
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,740
that this talk was given

26
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,049
think it's very important people you
know no future in laws and

27
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:46,670
why he is important to us and it's kind
of funny that we really need to explain

28
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:47,609
this to people

29
00:01:47,609 --> 00:01:51,100
because as we can see them I talk was
really fundamental

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,189
character in the history computing and

31
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,520
what some other some things as well I'm

32
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
Cameron I'm involved in a whole buncha
things

33
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,990
I'm now on this information for just
switches

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,469
one of the oldest public access UNIX
systems going

35
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:10,830
since 1984 I can see if US jeff is in
the air

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,090
audience which is really good I'm plea
plays doing as for you just tell that

37
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,120
sqft stop or I'm

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,690
really think exciting project got going
at the moment is called the norm

39
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,349
which is essentially a power down on
commercial Internet a big project

40
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,470
your worth looking into

41
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,690
I'm wide wide about it bother talk about
during really

42
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,159
want women to take now your time to talk
with this a invested

43
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,459
I'm festival

44
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:43,549
like I said before not a huge number of
people for many with him

45
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:46,900
even people to quite involved

46
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,370
computing Sam Pakistan still seem and
the doc

47
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,890
watcher did why so important to us I'm a
lot of people described as being the

48
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,540
father

49
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,048
modern computer and aggressor why he's
just gotten away

50
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,290
and and why i think is a valid
prescription I'm

51
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,030
a really big thing is that depending on
who you believe some of us would be a

52
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,290
not here if it wasn't for him I'm during
was one of the key figures

53
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:16,829
and breaking the German Enigma code
which before and

54
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,340
better detail I'm some mystery
historians think it proper shorten the

55
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:21,890
war by

56
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:26,099
serious I'm you know which is which is a
lot of lives

57
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:29,689
so yeah possibly we wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for him

58
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,150
I'm and the human rights issue is is
interesting as well

59
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,650
I during was a victor persecution I'm as

60
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,060
is quite tragic tale time today sewer

61
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,360
sets a good example to get people for
willing to fight for human rights now

62
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,310
and not wait until has to live I'm

63
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,400
sources on showing a kind of actually
hard to come by

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,150
I'm there's a few reasons for this in
England hisself

65
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,870
I think this there is still some
embarrassment I'm sounding him

66
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,420
this imbalance man that a he died on the
way

67
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,700
he did should expect explain later um

68
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,239
we have full security issues in England
I A

69
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,239
the people that make security holes just
crazy really we have things like the

70
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,259
40-year rule

71
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,539
which says that big secret should stay
secret for forty years

72
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,770
I'm so I love the papers and and
infrastructure has as I just coming

73
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,349
available

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,199
we also have fair use I'm banner

75
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,759
and the US faces is quite quite big
issue

76
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,800
but in the UK we just we don't have it
that's not like

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,630
I'm copyright exemptions educational
stuff generally

78
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm I mean something as simple as far to
call them at Pulau

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,690
like 10 percent that's it as quite
serious

80
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,190
so the main source isn't ruling a bunch
of books the paper and by him

81
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,719
um just again a quick shower fans who
this

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,180
that all four of those books anyone

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:04,180
ok I'm I guess I say that the the pack
my stuff you may have read

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,380
is on gotta actually Barack how many
people went up

85
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,330
I keiko I'm past the main book that
introduces people to churn

86
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,960
I'm as the title suggests about Kurt
Gerdau

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,130
was a I'm check mathematician

88
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,479
I'm MC Escher johann Sebastian bach:

89
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,479
I'm throughout the book the Turing
machine

90
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,050
just during stare at a computer as use
an example of

91
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,400
how computer not for sometimes works the
codebook

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,030
is is a as maxine but by british
journalist I'm

93
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,620
all about has triggered by King during
the enigma is is the main source of

94
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,259
information on children

95
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,660
by I could I'm Hargis massive massive
research project over

96
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,960
many many many years continually
revising his a

97
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,310
I'm Burke is is fantastic it's quite
biased

98
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:58,050
all can explain about later as well so
very bottom

99
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,099
or just as a reminder I

100
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,849
is not here I'm if you wanna go to a
bookstore

101
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,560
finance books I'm yet that that the

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,889
or just one is is really worth reading
let's if it's like

103
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,250
500 pages them the print it's like a
court sized

104
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,080
Burke so I'm get feinstein

105
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,139
okay so on churn was born and 1912

106
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm in the UK has consequences to

107
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,780
he was born in the UK I'm although he
was a conceived in India

108
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,930
this that was a involved in

109
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,660
management for office I'm and a
statement

110
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,759
Houston India shipping company bird
during went to school

111
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,120
and public school which is a private
school

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,360
with strange men returning on I'm

113
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,389
and he exhibited what a lot of us would
probably call cut rates

114
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,710
I'm you know Canova alone a a bit

115
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:01,590
but the an interesting guy there's quite
some oblivious to how the systems around

116
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,220
him worked on and the system in which he
was living

117
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,220
I'm and not something that runs
throughout his life

118
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,449
I'm stuff a cross between being
oblivious

119
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm not giving a damn which is public
weicker way to live

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,789
really except my customers want from
them were

121
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:22,289
talk about that die for freedom act were

122
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,440
of securing during was a

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,169
at this %uh this private school he was
I'm really good and science people and

124
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:31,128
the other subjects

125
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:36,009
um he went on to excel in science and
the school really wasn't satisfied

126
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:39,220
the school was trying to time now
well-rounded

127
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,360
English gentleman thus if their services

128
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,830
British Empire time I'm you know these
are people that we're gonna go under

129
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,250
I'm make the plan also I was quite scary
thought really am and those times

130
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,400
if they are coming to the US
administration I'm like it from Tony

131
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,789
Blair

132
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,300
Sykes cheering got out of school got
into King's College Cambridge

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm he was

134
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,750
not massively happy about that he was
aiming for

135
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,180
Trinity College the reasons I'm
attracted to college was

136
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,110
at school he fell in love with I could
more cum

137
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,490
I'm homosexuality is has come for a pic
same

138
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,879
in his life and again this was probably
the main thing

139
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,569
customers like family and I'm and he had
this

140
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,220
Siddartha oblivious not giving a damn

141
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,470
to tutor which is quite cool I'm

142
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:38,350
hard hard hard as it may be to believe
King's College is quite

143
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,540
at King's College in the thirties was
like white and an anarchistic

144
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:45,490
Haven really I'm Hargis this contest
thing

145
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,160
a mall in the trip to a sense that the
people there were really

146
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,730
I'm had the mindset that every case

147
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,180
every issue they were judged on its
merits they didn't feel constrained by

148
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,540
external laws

149
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,800
I'm in in 1933 the the union of King's
College

150
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
Park pasta motion saying that they
wouldn't never go to war for king and

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,160
country

152
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,459
I'm which is is quite serious thing to
say

153
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,720
in England and I your an hour I'm

154
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,630
fascist it has happened country you know
they're they're saying that

155
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,850
yeah I can possibly go and kill some
people in their security

156
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,770
but a you know there's there's no longer
good enough to go around

157
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,800
and I feel beloved country I think

158
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,030
I think chang was quite happy at Kings
I'm as

159
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:36,040
quite an amazing atmosphere that I'm

160
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,839
basically he was doing researchers doing
a fifty chain

161
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,920
I'm just just don't have a vehicle time

162
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,920
and and in particular in Kings

163
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,930
because it was so fantastic can say I'm

164
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,560
homosexuality just one picture people
was set at a blind eye

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,370
online service to society this is
correct quite complex I L

166
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm during this recession

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,660
which are SAS computer scientist because
he invented computer science

168
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,790
I'll so the colors I a he was interested
in some very

169
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,110
statements has massive implications for

170
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,580
how computing programming work I'm his
interest in things like go doesn't

171
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,750
witness them I'm that's a really
important

172
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,830
there's a lot in mathematics that says
that systems can either be

173
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,870
complete a powerful but not both

174
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,090
can't go there was it was a brilliant
mathematician ready

175
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:32,440
fuck things up for mathematicians I'm by
buyer

176
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,410
proving that in some tense is at least
as always to top

177
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,089
up that was the way he did it was really
interesting he

178
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,510
him except for if the other for and look
to

179
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,610
troops for things and he realized that

180
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,340
appeal i cum maybe of an object on her
program where we we look at the stadium

181
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,310
now owns

182
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,620
he thought like troops could be treat
this as as nouns and in particular his

183
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,520
numbers

184
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,850
so he he so he could number the proofs
and then

185
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,010
find some properties of those numbers
that consistent with them

186
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:07,270
them being valid for its and then he
could create some numbers

187
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,319
fitted within the system one for valor
proofs

188
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,050
I'm say is really interesting lives in a
paradox stuff

189
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:17,580
I'm I'm sure must have you ever had
things like Prince

190
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,610
fusca longer into a lot easier

191
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,650
I'm but get kind of stuff is really
interesting really worth looking into

192
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,959
um gonna be touched on case goes into
the nature of

193
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,760
truth I'm nitrogen financing was
something that really interested

194
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,380
a chewing a song that that is is
actually really important and

195
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,550
I'll looking at I'm computer programming
whether programs will

196
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,570
terminate in particular I'm

197
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,730
infinity turns out to be quite different
from what you expect

198
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,150
I'm in them I'm in the popular

199
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,770
too complex for example which I don't
think infinity as being a

200
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,890
in for a huge number I'm at times other

201
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:01,290
wide variety of types reference a

202
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,250
I'm in a sec simple example is if you
take number one number two

203
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,390
nickel factions in between if I'm as an
from the factions in between

204
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,630
your you could just keep divided into
small small small slices

205
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,720
sorry between the numbers 1&2 you have
an SF infinitely dense number line

206
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,090
I'm but then we can find other numbers
that

207
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm fit between 12 but on factions like
the Square after

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,390
which is a an infinitesimal I'm snaps

209
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,990
some mission between 12 network said 12
in in ferry Dennis

210
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,500
sick looking in from a dense jump in the
number line with some holes in

211
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,890
I'm sir infinity is not I'm what it
seems really

212
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,230
and is quite important in a in computer
Betsy which was really a concept

213
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,160
children came up with I'm the whole
bunch of like challenges in mathematics

214
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,270
I'm proposed by I could kill but I'm

215
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,410
he did he did something kind of quite
column also really amazing

216
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:03,060
I'm when he was coming up for retirement
I'm and stuff like not retiring

217
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,070
and a and doing something worthwhile it
so it just right open to challenges

218
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,550
like to cite the world do all that stuff
to home to progress in mathematics

219
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,830
sir I this big blister problems and said
any one of these problems that

220
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:20,860
that we myself I'm pushes back the
boundaries in mathematics

221
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,530
I'm go dao um so salter

222
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:29,110
to have those problems by I'm saying
that the math doesn't really work

223
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,330
access accounts at on and a

224
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,740
during went on to to solve the halting
problem halting problems quite

225
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,000
contrasting really when you I'm sure
you've written computer programs that

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm going to leaps and you think

227
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,670
that's really annoying gunnery some
books trying like hell

228
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,150
what happened I'm in general

229
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,959
if you want to say if the computer
program is going to enter in further

230
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,600
I'm you might think well why another
computer program

231
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,150
read through the car like pasta the card
I'm

232
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:05,240
and cheer was was thinking about this I
they obviously not with computer

233
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,120
programs when

234
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,000
went during talks about computers a man
who in his papers

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,460
don't see when I can be just as my
concerts with computer so computer meant

236
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,120
someone who sat down at a table with
them

237
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,830
bunch I country had number crunching

238
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,590
basically chambers were interested in
the idea of

239
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,170
methods for moments that's for doing
things like that essentially what would

240
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,900
now call algorithms

241
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,050
basically counter the concept above the
algorithm I'm

242
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,400
so we've got an algorithm we wanna say
doesn't work is it gonna just enter

243
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,480
continuously

244
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,700
sorry my have another algorithm I'm
possibly and I had

245
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,540
I'm I a week we would meet through the
card

246
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,849
would go through the code step-by-step
everything what's happening in this card

247
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,670
physically on we might replace also

248
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,890
computer programmer mike the computer
program goes through pausing for

249
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,490
currency

250
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,980
fiscally however I'm

251
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,180
very quickly you should see a problem
which is that

252
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:05,820
we're watching a program to pass the
program but hammering of programs and

253
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,950
other

254
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,240
sorry got these things last last last
last programs

255
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,440
I'm and says that really cake casing
that chill and watch out

256
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,830
I'm just former West service

257
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,700
all probably limited in that power I'm

258
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,740
11 think jurors were interested in was
like

259
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,360
the concept of the soul he was he was
ob- for as a Christian

260
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,490
like nice people were and it became
quite a strong I system and

261
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,680
quite interesting to look for his life
so things that

262
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,510
made him change his mind I'm and he said
I think

263
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,189
he and and a lot of other people in into
in the breaking point some mathematics

264
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,040
and the breaking

265
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,810
significant once a physics people
so-called

266
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,630
I'm sure my serve you have same people

267
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,560
over read about I'm quantum theory
people using this is like a

268
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,020
justification for

269
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,140
sankara's have free will nonsense I'm

270
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,880
which would I s anyone with anyone
anyone with a basic knowledge of physics

271
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,930
has I'm think things like on some
spontaneity and

272
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,090
contract allows the stuff for us was
seen as a real opportunity

273
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:19,090
I'm taken off I'm to come when

274
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,530
when back our lives from science to say
hold on

275
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,560
these random things and signs this this
conference want to have

276
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,460
to your things just happen in the these
polenz a field stuff this

277
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,940
I'm another thing during was just random
interesting was tense if I'm scum

278
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,200
system bizarre as really nice

279
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,210
difficult problem in maths and that's
the thing that you think

280
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,660
should be quite so local with a formal
method

281
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,780
science reforms is quite simple that as
the

282
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,770
numbers get bigger and bigger and bigger
the primes get fewer and fewer and fewer

283
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,680
which in church efforts to make sense
because with a big number

284
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,220
far more numbers below at the most part
together to get that number

285
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,980
I'm so simple and shit if I wouldn't say
seems to make sense

286
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,040
I'm and trainers aren't interesting I do
have

287
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,310
making a formal method I'm the kurds

288
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,669
I'm print proof that trying to get black

289
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,690
much less tense as we go along I'm going

290
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,060
so he's he's is that as as assertive a
problem

291
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,079
Sao mice to his life really I'm

292
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,639
as it comes to conserve computer is
something he wants to tackle

293
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,780
and he does in the hardware why

294
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,310
one other the reasons that police some
people have had other

295
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:45,060
chewing is is the cheering machine which
was his idealized concept love

296
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,629
over computer churn russians really
really in contrasting

297
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,560
looks really good example but discuss
quality concept

298
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,370
chairing thought about how how we solve
problems in particular had already left

299
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,420
much X

300
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,020
my thoughts about someone sitting at
table with lights pica

301
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm sometimes I'm how would like how
they did on the country help myself

302
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,260
problems how to do proofs

303
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,100
and he tried to to think of what he can
cut away from the picture

304
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,670
take together or excessive how how we do
mathematics or how we solve any problems

305
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:22,210
they came up with the church in and the
idea the church as they have

306
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,810
info long tape with squares and you have
a

307
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,270
had the country into squares so

308
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,710
summers past my have calluses on head
can I is the characters that

309
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,170
had like more characters I'm

310
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,660
the machine has a has a whole bunch of
states

311
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,350
I'm depending on what state is an
depends what we're doing

312
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,360
took to the next character comes across
on the next quarter comes across

313
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,950
the interesting thing about the church
in I'm

314
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,980
is that is quite easy to extend the idea

315
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,530
intermission with Ike lots of lots of
tapes lots of type edsall

316
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm two-dimensional types I said this
one-dimensional fighter

317
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,400
for I'm machines the house

318
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:11,470
any change point can branch off and make
fast decisions

319
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,860
the really nice thing about the church
minister you see this movie had a church

320
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,700
in actually

321
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,470
any nature and machine know how
complicated you can always condense it

322
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,900
down

323
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,440
to the idea ever a single head with a a
long time

324
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,820
okay um chairing

325
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,290
sold about this machine we thought about

326
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:34,659
writing a description on the machine
what the mission does

327
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,610
how does a so I can I do if structure in
Table

328
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,890
sorry shearing machine mature machine
for example that

329
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,510
absent on this together goes on that I
reeds number

330
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,240
return X number as the law likes the
certainly a

331
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,050
much downside I'm so he's got the under
these tables and tables

332
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,060
describe the russians I saw I could get
when these tables

333
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,820
and fade into another turn machine and
get the church and to

334
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,520
excessive mimic I'm the first German
Chancellor got like a

335
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,860
addition shearing machine like anna's
description get them out

336
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,130
patient remission light on its
description Capcom

337
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,290
like a sofa watching russian light has
description

338
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:20,620
and and would feed these descriptions
answers to what became known as the

339
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,930
universe such a machine

340
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,480
can mimic any other transaction so these
descriptions essentially computer

341
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,580
programs he came up

342
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:30,570
ready with with the trick on such a
computer program

343
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,800
the universe a computer which which is
is quite different from things like that

344
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,600
which is calculating machine

345
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,820
on and I'm Lovelace's

346
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,510
kind of programs and things like that
the looms

347
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,340
you know the the computers were were
based on looms for weaving

348
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,679
and you do it feat some about waiving
I'm

349
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,160
but it could really need to assess fix
steps and could only

350
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,960
follow whatever was in the past some I'm
West children

351
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,230
really came up with this idea of

352
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,550
computer programs that can be fed into
you and that's for sure machines

353
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm and 111 kinda interesting side
issues that

354
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,610
some intrinsic and the idea that your
machine is the idea that changing

355
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,060
can modify some colored because

356
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,139
the the code it follows is on this tight
and I can arise

357
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,260
catches Michael like arches so in still
intrinsically in

358
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,710
in the concept is quite powerful
computing computer phone concept

359
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,760
I did it take you know I can go through
and changes I'm tired

360
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,840
I'm side despite the fact that china
Shenhua

361
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,419
same kind of abstract concept

362
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:45,420
it is it is sufficiently powerful to be
a decent scripts have a computer

363
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,930
and I'm

364
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:51,950
some of you may have also have the
chance test

365
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,260
I'm pop popularized by I'm the

366
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,790
if I come test and Blade Runner

367
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,399
side you've all seen by Tanya okay
that's everyone

368
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,030
it's not as I think

369
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,399
Viscount test is a is a test to see if
someone's Android on top

370
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,350
I'm square problem and society today
this and was walking around

371
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm you should know of because that
could be and undressing next year

372
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,100
I'm if he had a what come from jane and
you could tell

373
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,120
what can freshen just looks at the the
I'm

374
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,350
physical responses I'm in the body

375
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,620
and uses that to determine

376
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,140
whether past my issue was an Android

377
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,830
maturing I'm he lived a little bit
before played on last night

378
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:45,189
I'm him invented the idea of the Turing
test he

379
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,720
rejected looking at a physical
attributes because

380
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,270
he didn't think that was really an
important aspect

381
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm of intelligence now

382
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,430
why can't this just a test some
something human

383
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,740
sharing insurance test is either I'm
wider or

384
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,800
more restrictive depending on the floor
space choice test was was to test if

385
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,280
something is intelligent and choice or a
nice because a

386
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,440
can have allows us to not walk around
with defining

387
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,310
intelligences very very simple idea
based on on

388
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,379
something called imitation gun and an
imitation gun

389
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,470
they have a man and a woman I'm hand

390
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,010
their hidden from you hun screams were
and you can possibly questions

391
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,850
and you can get those sponsors we have
to work now his name and his own

392
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,940
and a and it's it's really not a good

393
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,290
this is like the example churn basis his
testifies

394
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,330
really not a good example Centurion test

395
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,530
wave a place where people with the
computer and which one

396
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,050
fine now which I speech program which
was chairman

397
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,129
I'm the man and woman concept doesn't
really work very well

398
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,580
because curious essentially says that if

399
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,689
if it's sufficiently difficult but we
can tell quick

400
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,960
which one is the computer program which
one is the PacSun

401
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,040
then than the computer program can be
said to be intelligent

402
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,020
I'm this is why the man and woman thing
doesn't really work because

403
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,670
nice to have you would say that if you
could get so some time a woman

404
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,160
doesn't mean that that the same thing
I'm

405
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:25,260
so maybe my picture has not been
misguided with as a compliment and as

406
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,920
I'm has his papers imaging test

407
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,600
the Turing test this really really
relevant to diana's really relevant to

408
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,870
sir people in interest in security says
quite

409
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm important to text if people here and
I'll

410
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,450
I'm man if you have these capture

411
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,660
my nephew if used issues capture today

412
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,970
ok I am sorry coffee if you know what it
is completely automated public Turing

413
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,230
Test to tell computers and humans apart

414
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,440
capture those I'm annoying little boxes
you get when you

415
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,520
on purse messages to email that's maybe

416
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,750
for web interface or you signed up for
for

417
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,630
anything on the web you got little box
with some John what Lexus near talk

418
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,990
letters I'm this essentially during test
because to

419
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,170
to compete for I was trying to test
whether you're here or not I'm

420
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:20,570
and a its its kind of ironical

421
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,500
and pretty sad that these are widespread
sup the net and that there really

422
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,790
testing whether human not because

423
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,149
certain people I'm fellas tests all the
time

424
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,490
visually impaired people for example I'm
that human

425
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,740
in my opinion I'm but obviously not
include I'm

426
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,000
according to people who invented capture

427
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,610
safe from a security point of view it's
quite interesting to to viertel

428
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,490
financed a is is some human office a
computer

429
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,930
and maybe intelligences is is quite a
good way to test this

430
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,910
some of you may have been at the SECC
last year there were some

431
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,710
an 06 what the heck last year there was
a talk on by a factor Xa

432
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:04,230
and fingerprint scanners I'm basically

433
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:08,809
fingerprint scanner so what's a security
and this time I'm a buncha crap

434
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,410
cya franken's house general bonnet like
600-acre I

435
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:18,180
I'm yak any fork like Michael a text for
it to be a fingerprint scanner

436
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,420
does not serve life sentences I'm I'm

437
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,590
united to say checkers reali finger in
the heavenly

438
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,030
actor friends finger of I wanna

439
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:31,420
southern testing whether people alive
are is quite interesting and maybe

440
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,030
testing sometimes as much by trade-up

441
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,460
this is that this is a I think I can
capture I'm

442
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,930
is quite difficult I I'm to do in

443
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,970
visual recognition with I'll photos are
things

444
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,470
capture capture is a concept is is not
very strong

445
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:53,210
I'm with missile lesser ones that we
have

446
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,490
very very easy chat you know what a few
lines how

447
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,960
to to be captured stuff I'm just by

448
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,730
by I'm doing optical character
recognition just like skyward

449
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,400
this capture however is quite cool say
have a fight as a bunch

450
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,540
animals and you have to click on the a
the animals that asks for

451
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,970
set my say you have like kittens and
puppies and you have to

452
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,120
click on the kitchens I'm and thats

453
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,830
relatively difficult for computer
programs today

454
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:28,059
this is Mike this is a this really
really just trying to cheer not the

455
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,020
concert for intelligence because

456
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,179
I'm anyone who knows about offer
sometimes when either

457
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,440
a bunch of problems that look easy or
look comfortable

458
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,490
really aunt I'm

459
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,260
visual recognition as one of them speech
recognition is is also on them

460
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,260
I'm special operations really very
difficult

461
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,950
to do well it's very difficult and we're
not really sure what humans can decide

462
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,610
well

463
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,679
I'm and and again official oppression 10
not really sure why

464
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:00,210
I miss yeah I we can instantly tell the
difference between

465
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,470
a Fox found a computer programs or
struggle

466
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,970
because they were have likewise rises
all the cool things

467
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,290
animals have yeah

468
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:16,440
aside during this was a Cambridge

469
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,850
King's College doing math search and I'm
not water

470
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:24,890
Book now and prior to world war two
Hispanic the halftime

471
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,290
at a place for black chick markets
sipping fisting that for workshops and

472
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,100
stuff

473
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,190
I'm but actually Park

474
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,260
is a was the government that was the

475
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,910
Government Code and cypher school which
is a bit like the NSA

476
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,720
in the US I'm but she Park that
government can suffer so

477
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,790
became GCHQ I'm which is the

478
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:50,170
government communications headquarters
which is the Uhaul occurred in the Annex

479
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,800
I

480
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,480
sir you're familiar with INS and
research can stuff via

481
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,870
I'm planned and the US to have I'm

482
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,350
FBI Treasury the security so I that

483
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,309
kills people the country's an SI like

484
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:10,750
fits the birth information cares about
his information is

485
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,210
inning we have to chk I'm GCHQ is like

486
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,300
quite getting secret if on

487
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,030
serve you may have had a flights as a
public key encryption

488
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:25,149
public encryption was convinced that you
chk

489
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,080
I'm and way before like diffie-hellman k
exchange

490
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,080
stuff for well at least a few years
before

491
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,928
I'm kept quiet as any a few scattered

492
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:39,910
so it became public GCHQ very very
secretive

493
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:44,140
Canada and England secrecy is really is
a a key thing

494
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:47,420
with a some government bodies match and
security ones

495
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,270
I'm so a lot of the old Government Code

496
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,450
Government Code and cypher school stuff
relationship during

497
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:59,620
status is quite kept quiet much apart
quite nice place to hang out

498
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,390
I'm a bunch of people that we would
really recognize what happens

499
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,290
typical market rates the way that they
they solve problems rights to secure to

500
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:10,720
just a bigger the people in

501
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,280
in a room possible problem around to
everyone

502
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,700
having discussions trying to not having
like settle a stripper and stuff

503
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,120
so if you if you look into like history
but actually park and

504
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,179
what went on there you really say that
and mobile service what we would

505
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:29,340
consider hackers

506
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,670
I'm controlled by the military but they
risk

507
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,970
this sieve unwritten rule saddam

508
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:40,480
that's evidenced of people I on sharing
and the other code breakers

509
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,540
were given a a free Ryan re say they
didn't wear uniform that

510
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:51,540
spec they're all equal they want us to
abandon extra people

511
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,650
has worked chilling spam I'm much over

512
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:01,230
what's a and I'm one of their this of
Hopsin this

513
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,090
lovely a the grounds are the specs
tightly I'm

514
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,400
chilling spend his days their work
working on security problems working

515
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,980
on in particular how to buy cars but
also also how to

516
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,200
to make some likes meh security as well

517
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,850
talk about that later on

518
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,299
the really key thing I'm the Bletchley
Park did was

519
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,870
break the Gemini card I'm

520
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,299
dais quite a lot of controversy around
in a

521
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,340
I'm it's not well-founded really

522
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,549
the controversy is about whether they
are

523
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:39,620
that the Polish actually Bocanegra

524
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,870
fast vending machine

525
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,900
was a an electromechanical and siphon
system

526
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:51,000
star you pay me a message

527
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,130
it does some number crunching I'm
electricity flows around

528
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,929
things move and makes a sound lights
light up and

529
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,270
you have have security

530
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:07,809
the maker was needed because seven and
model long

531
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:12,490
codes for bob rush I mean it was just
people like stuff from its a paper

532
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,280
I'm like juggling lesson stuff is really
recall

533
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:22,090
in the setting is the idea from the one
one-time pad encryption

534
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,150
I'm camera from knows what went on

535
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:29,559
options moms that's all over again I
some

536
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm 11 time putting fiction I'm

537
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,870
is I'm theoretically so mathematically
100 percent secure

538
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:42,010
you have something you want to encode
and they have essentially password

539
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,150
that's the same length as what you are
incurred

540
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,130
and mix them together fasteners very
randomly generated

541
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,920
that encourage that have the possum
together out

542
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,940
company sucks I where the process to use
it once hence the time one-time pad

543
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,720
on as I don't have to overcome systems
using one-time

544
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,750
Helen corruption probably side of the
house on

545
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,790
110 pat pat encryption is is
mathematically impossible to break

546
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:13,260
Anya as not makes it very difficult to
break

547
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,330
encryption systems using one-time pads
I'm why is that

548
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,510
while if not matter if it's
mathematically possible for a one-time

549
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,220
pad

550
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:25,590
encryption then to said to break a
system using one-time pads

551
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:28,820
can only maintain its not using them
properly so

552
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:32,360
11 time sometimes useful like network
scared Portugal's

553
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,610
I'm and that generally not like it

554
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:39,350
because favor use the pads so it's not
one time

555
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:42,860
and random our algorithms that use to
generate I'll

556
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,090
banqueting I don't cry random that the
seating answer

557
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,080
forgotten them so it's United's is not
much tougher difficult to break

558
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,710
sign network and encryption systems in
one-time pads

559
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,590
and I'm british hacker John with no

560
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,540
has been doing some work on this in the
UK look at things like

561
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,220
when when the air the messages a too
short or long when you get one

562
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:10,260
haddon your iPad out the message is on
the rise

563
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,379
and then you've got like nine cipher
text just a a

564
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:16,909
an 11-person said anything that was
needed

565
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:20,220
really as it was very important to have

566
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,859
a practical system encryption say the
name

567
00:34:23,859 --> 00:34:27,509
was way stronger than me I some other

568
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,320
paper and a pen going up Ronaldo
nonsense and

569
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,030
jumping up I'm but obviously knock

570
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,159
strong strong like want a public option
but to ever say I was massively popular

571
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,389
as a cuppa commercial system

572
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:44,820
soul at German and Saturday's the German

573
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,240
military one interest in it in the
beginning I'm

574
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,330
and people became an interesting in
encryption

575
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:56,590
just before water when it was like this
covered how I'm AC the

576
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,090
the codes have been broken for more
along

577
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,230
in one model one lady was very popular
and with radar unit in nature

578
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,850
we think that security law

579
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,460
the k2 how then and then works just like
these this vote says

580
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,609
I'm to recover so Center the Russian

581
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:18,100
and so within eight mile got a box your
cable or

582
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,700
and you got some lights with with access
beside them

583
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,000
and essentially you want to read a press
OK and

584
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,020
like top pretty much around them like

585
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:32,240
your I'm in corruption is really the
process have

586
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,600
take information making a look random
have removing

587
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,920
over patterns format I'm

588
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,119
the way the neck knitted s was there
when %um pressed Obama

589
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:47,530
cable or it I'm the electrical socket
once a bunch of voters

590
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,640
I'm got a better picture

591
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,240
and the press for example pay

592
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,630
and electrical sector this was forms

593
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,840
through these rights as I'm she would
light up

594
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,520
I'm wouldn't really work if it's just a
bunch of wires

595
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,140
or to sign of recycled but because they
were votes as

596
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:14,220
has your press in case the voters are
going around I'm

597
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,220
so this second changing so fast I again
later on

598
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,670
and the message you wouldn't get that's
ok a change like a

599
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,480
say for example I'm say cachingtype

600
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,540
while these lights lining up and it
looks pretty random

601
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,910
I'm because the electrical socket when

602
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,339
through the notes is one way and I'm
came back to the right is another why

603
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,380
with this reflects a it meant that the
then come first serve

604
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,070
I'm symmetric in the an hour I'm

605
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,640
why is that if someone else had them
ignore shame no setup the same way as

606
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,569
yours

607
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,600
I'm take a type in the colored

608
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,170
and get out the plaintext I'm which was
which is quite nice Aiden

609
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:59,930
Udinese has likened
encryption/decryption might

610
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:03,368
then immerse as as many quite
interesting sry really worth

611
00:37:03,369 --> 00:37:06,660
I'm look and how it works

612
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,180
when you when you set up the neg ok you
got this this this box ask a hole in the

613
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,750
sector

614
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:14,970
whole other things you can change you
change them in a

615
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,780
essentially makes a configuration just
like a churn russians configuration

616
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,340
and in particular go five things you can
change

617
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,550
she got the smartest I'm and

618
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:29,980
that and then mine military machine had
three roaches

619
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:33,540
and you've got a choice if I F you can
put in I'm

620
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,619
so that's cross-examinations I sent that
the excess

621
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:41,780
go around I'm more you're talking a
message

622
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,220
now the fast or too cuz I'm quite
quickly and then a freak

623
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,760
love once or twice a goes on the next
night virtual more and one

624
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,240
as a around ground once or twice the
next one virtual move

625
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,810
I'm there was some flickering inside the
votes of that dictated

626
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,160
at what point it would go around I'm

627
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,410
they're like this cover not strings

628
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,029
because three writes this weekend we can
put them in different order success like

629
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,330
and also some russians gotta plug cord

630
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:14,509
on the fun of the Magna for John Branca
picture

631
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,619
you can kinda Santa and

632
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:20,920
right in front of the picture below the
cable or I'm

633
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,440
because a whole bunch of passive sockets
and we've got some

634
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,290
like Patch Leads essentially so we can
cross over some letters

635
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:32,590
I'm that makes I'm extending my read it
difficult to break

636
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,140
I'm adding the park board was

637
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,500
made a much much bigger I'm

638
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,380
increase they this number I'm number of
configurations

639
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:50,380
far more than adding more of this word
I'm so it's quite interesting thing

640
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,520
than a formal thing you there has set
the starting positions for those voters

641
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,410
so there's writers

642
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:00,080
I'm SF I've got the alphabet round match
except the starting position

643
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,420
so generally steps 124 would probably be
like that that

644
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,780
what would my because de que I'm

645
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,340
essentially that the configuration a big
name is the password

646
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,430
all you need is nigh I think enigma
machine in the same configuration to the

647
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:15,339
kinda stuff

648
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,820
so the configuration axes password I'm

649
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,760
with billions accommodations I'm

650
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,650
say the fact the first four be like the
date card and then for each message

651
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,570
you set 3 I'm the configuration and sus

652
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,750
I'm initial position at least three
races

653
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:37,090
sire day code would be like a codebook

654
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:40,730
shuster this issue distribution heard
books around

655
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:44,930
around when you're killing people I'm
and then for each message

656
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,149
you start off by by Sen sending I'm
death

657
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,100
serve three letter grade that say
whether additional swatches

658
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:56,160
would be I'm

659
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,160
it was seriously difficult to write and
thats going that's the Paris thing

660
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,020
and the Polish broke I'm

661
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,369
finnick map before water started

662
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:11,730
I'm just quite sensible thing to do as a
lesson the golan

663
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,280
I'll you know braided brake technology
before his interests against it

664
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,810
I'm that the pro-life iraq felt his
presence

665
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:23,470
that I felt this discover shadow after
rehearsal

666
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,849
bad stuff might happen I'm so that
watching TV

667
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:29,880
like we do now I thought it might be
sensible to a

668
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,869
you know might make hay while the Sun
shines on other

669
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:37,210
however the reason I don't buy into like
this

670
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,290
take control receive either quite a few
angry

671
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,240
and reporters people angry that people
ensuring that the kind of like magma

672
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,890
when the Polish broke it years before
and

673
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,730
repeatedly try to give the British and
big machines

674
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:55,510
uncovered perks and plans how to break
it

675
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:59,010
and the British sense I would not much
of interest as

676
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,400
I'm that those are like

677
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,220
fair issues but the nickname was in just
one machine the whole

678
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,930
whole variations of them the won the
Polish folk was quite

679
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:12,970
simple I'm the Polish think

680
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,720
did do something many many powerful
though which is that they invented

681
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm the invention comes over for that
invented the idea of

682
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,490
the modern idea of how we break hopes in
particular what

683
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,760
the poorest address the have nots
magicians biking types

684
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,770
so prior to that you just got

685
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,270
a bunch of you might sound else

686
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:37,880
I'm and break something you just get
random people I'll in particu- get

687
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,550
linguists and once alike

688
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,109
yeah this is a language issue scholars
and linguists I'm

689
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:47,509
the the Polish store know maybe maybe
months is what we need now

690
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,630
I'm so that was something the British
did copy

691
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,440
and I think that's really important that
people breaking

692
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,890
like cheering and people from hand
hand-picked from

693
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,299
from cambridge House yesterday and I'll
pick from the West Palm smiley

694
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,380
there were like I'm I'm linguists and
there were random people as well one

695
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,520
other things but we parted with Sam

696
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,980
place at like a a crossword competition
I'm in the times

697
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,859
I'm sad if you can break this crossword
in like a 10 minutes then

698
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:18,910
some national address letter to advise
people know

699
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,930
saddam safe side they'd be

700
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:26,009
joining but see Paul I'm and my
standards I when special parking

701
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,760
to smoke a school competitions and a got
involved

702
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,550
I'm and reminder of how the war

703
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:37,400
the way it's always an egg was broken
was I mean a lot of the

704
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,619
the ideas we use them now for
record-breaking

705
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:44,270
I'm known plaintext was a was a really
good thing

706
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,470
I'm you can

707
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:50,720
you can if you're if it's sensible but
with the war

708
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,849
or in a situation you can't force plain
text

709
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:57,349
yeah and I'm again which is asking
people sir

710
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:02,109
the British had this lovely idea that if
they drop bombs in some places bomb sent

711
00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:02,970
ships

712
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:06,380
and Thani the grid reference estate you
know they newsweek

713
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,849
new the court not said whether ships
were and then in the radio traffic

714
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:13,730
minutes you know out of sight that would
be transmitted so they've got some

715
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:19,109
something I'm don't know what's in the
message I'm

716
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:22,279
people a slack as well I'm

717
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:25,380
summer the German German military were
abyss Corey

718
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,480
they do things like he's their
girlfriends initials as their

719
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,030
aa an actual lie to Settings on

720
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,840
or they might transmit the weather
forecast a set time during the day

721
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,340
in a set format and the Navy

722
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,630
one-size-fits-all breaking that the nave

723
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:48,099
enabling I was the very difficult thing
I'm

724
00:43:48,099 --> 00:43:51,390
they just enforce the rules really
rigidly

725
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,160
no girlfriends action maybe the people
in town I wouldn't have girlfriends

726
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,990
I'm but by those and I like go find
officials I think that there's no

727
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,840
fix weather forecasts on its so getting
getting at

728
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,650
and I'm paying taxes quite difficult the
main why the more was broken

729
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:12,060
was to got these notice we got this
configuration

730
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:16,480
and you've got essentially pretty random
text coming out

731
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,890
what looks like a random text I'm

732
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:25,420
but within that Texas is really a
fingerprint how the mission to set up

733
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:28,599
and children worked out waz I'm that we
could like

734
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,280
work out these fingerprints from from
these at configurations

735
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,369
and I have catalogs and fingerprints and

736
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:39,450
yeah I think and something the papers
and compare scared all the time in like

737
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,430
I'm to say stuff thanks to father

738
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:48,109
and the the fingerprints like manifest
themselves as these chains

739
00:44:48,109 --> 00:44:51,680
Lexus I'm where you're talking message

740
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,310
and maybe the next a aka ask why law and
its

741
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,630
encoded into various different things
and ice their

742
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:02,410
wheels go around for rotations and

743
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,420
via you get like these patterns coming
up that

744
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,810
were time chines to find the chines

745
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,080
they used an idea that the partnership
come up with a these

746
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,119
big change for bombs I'm try half cups
Wikipedia

747
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,619
love with the job on her

748
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,160
bombs are essentially hole puncher have
I'm and making machines all stuck

749
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,299
together

750
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,250
I'm and cracked crunching for

751
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,380
so it put in I'm summer

752
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,140
cipher text and the bomb on what
essentially trying decoder

753
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,490
and and I'm lock so me.i tonight's
different configurations

754
00:45:40,490 --> 00:45:43,590
now if you it's just started with just

755
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:48,280
the these bombs and you were essentially
done brute force attack from enigma

756
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,740
know what no way you know like with my

here he was actually assassinated

823
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,530
freezer to conserve whole bunch of

824
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,640
point about the death a bit strange this

825
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:15,330
Apple's iPhone issue was poisoned was

828
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:32,410
want when you look at people like
sharing her lover sex action intelligent

829
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:33,259
undetected

830
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:37,540
love really cool stuff I'm

831
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:42,210
you have to ask why what can what can
you learn from them and a

832
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:46,359
in lecture on Japanese garden design so
this really nice quote from

833
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:50,490
months or basher who is a like a writer
did I C termini

834
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,450
the old process seek what they saw I
think that when you look

835
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:58,300
the lives of people like chewing you
should has served just trying to copy

836
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,450
what they did

837
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:03,400
on survive running home in building a

842
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,920
a good reasons for that I'm but

843
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,130
it's really nice to think about being
difficult ideas along

844
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,820
it's just a really healthy feel prime to
think about rebound

845
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:35,859
