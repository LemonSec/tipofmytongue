1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,229
is a good we're going to get a little k
is he said my name is Peter Wehner

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,240
it was a long time ago I was just
thinking but I was realizing I'm going

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,050
up in my thirtieth anniversary of

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:13,040
poking around the internet and this is
long ago and I was in the Palo Alto

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,070
school system

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,960
a and back then and I think it's still
the case you at Packard was always very

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,100
gracious and they kind of left these
machines around for us to play with

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,760
and we found our way to poke around and
they

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,400
they give us their own little systems
were supposed to talk to but they left

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,859
the modems unconnected and

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,199
someone says well we should try this
number and it was a it was that

12
00:00:36,199 --> 00:00:40,289
I guess it was the TEP was the ames tip
for getting into the

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,889
what was then the ARPANET and you dial
up and would ask you for a password and

14
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:44,989
I was explaining just

15
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:49,510
you can just do you just hit return it
will work and there really wasn't much

16
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:53,138
you could do except when they're talking
to some guy with a primitive chat system

17
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:53,889
at MIT

18
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:57,049
who said it was a editing a file and I
think that's all that we managed to do

19
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,269
but there were only about 30 or 40
machines on the Internet at that time

20
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:04,269
but so apropos that the

21
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:07,220
the real reason I'm here is not to tell
you this kinda stories but to talk about

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:07,640
this

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,030
this idea been flogging for the last for
five years

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,900
and this is an idea that came to me

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,070
when I was working on an article abouts

26
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,300
privacy and the internet and this was
you know baby

27
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,040
late 90's and people were talking about
you know these new stores there are

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,460
springing up like Amazon and everyone
wanted to build these personal dossiers

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,950
on a customer's

30
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,810
because that was however an offer on
this great service was gonna be

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:34,910
customizable

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,759
you're going to be able to go to the
store and we know everything about you

33
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,290
in which you know show you what you
really wanted to buy

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,170
you wouldn't have to waste your time
looking at stuff you can you know wanna

35
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,570
buy

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,120
and that was all well and good but of
course everyone was also worried about

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,050
the privacy implications that this

38
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,070
and so is good I got this argument with
this guy were said it did not occur it

39
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,010
did not seem

40
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,150
obvious to me that in order to offer
this level of service you had to have

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,110
this dossier

42
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,320
and I have the advantage of once meeting
the guy Ralph Merkle

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,619
who started who invent was one of the
inventors a public key cryptography

44
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,379
and when I was talking my civil how did
you come up with this idea

45
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,730
and ralph said he goes well I wondered
you know could you use two keys

46
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,560
one that would lock the data and another
one that would unlock it and teachers I

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,810
tried to prove that that couldn't be
done

48
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,709
and when I couldn't do that I tried to
prove that it could be done now if you

49
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,099
know enough about math whenever

50
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,578
that that still hasn't been resolved but
I try to take that

51
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:36,209
that spirit apply it to this case and I
I tried to prove first that in order to

52
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,700
have these stores you had to have these
dossiers about all your customers

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,549
and I couldn't try to prove that I tried
to prove the opposite

54
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:48,019
and I did not come up with anything as
cool as public key cryptography didn't

55
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,670
come up with anything that was

56
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,689
you know as as mindboggling because what
I ended up doing is finding out that the

57
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:54,980
old crypto protocols

58
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,959
word would do pretty much what you
wanted to do but I did come up with a

59
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,029
lot of examples

60
00:03:00,029 --> 00:03:04,609
for how you could run a business like
Amazon or how you could run a database

61
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:06,439
you could run a business for any par-

62
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,459
you know any kind of database that was
out there without keeping these

63
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:17,459
extensive dossiers so this is the
traditional way

64
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:20,680
that people see security and

65
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,389
with this is what I'm trying to convert
here and the traditional ways that you

66
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,459
kind of see your database or your sister
Marie your store or whatever it is is

67
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:29,340
this fortress

68
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,139
and you're gonna have all the secret
information about your customers but the

69
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:35,700
way you're going to try to protect it is
to build a wall around

70
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,230
and inside that wall you're gonna have
all the information in a clear

71
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,069
but if you do a good job with that
parameter then the people the customers

72
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:44,349
will

73
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,779
their data will still be safe I am now

74
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:51,418
there's some truth to that you can do a
good job you can get Oracle and the

75
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,849
the ad say that Oracle's unbreakable so
you know there you're set

76
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:57,959
um but you know it

77
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,989
anybody here in this conference knows
that that's not really the way it works

78
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:05,010
friends you know even if you do by
Oracle

79
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:08,069
there are lots of other ways that people
can get around things one there could be

80
00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,400
a hole in your operating system so even
if you do a good job with your database

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,029
security

82
00:04:12,029 --> 00:04:14,889
there might have been some hole left in
there because you're running and said

83
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,140
the Windows operating system or

84
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,190
you could have another hole where
someone actually just walks into the in

85
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,070
the door and just takes the hard disk

86
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:25,080
so then all of a sudden they have the
data in the clear so even though you're

87
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,080
got really great computer security the
your physical security may

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,859
havel a hole in it and even if you do a
good job with all those

89
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,410
from those traditional solutions you
could star pravah

90
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,450
insiders and this continues to be a
problem where you have

91
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,680
you know people at the IRS or snooping
on famous people's tax forms

92
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,830
you know pretty much anywhere you go you
have a problem with insiders

93
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,599
and so if you're running a business if
you're trying to build these things

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,690
when you're going you're trying to you
know keep your customers happy while

95
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,850
keeping information about them it's very
hard I think to use the traditional

96
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,180
solution

97
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,760
so what I've tried to do is all straight
some ways you can

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,920
keep from you know how the system that
does use for work that answers questions

99
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,590
for people

100
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:14,010
without actually knowing anything at all
so you wanna have a

101
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,800
if database that answers useful
questions without holding any useful

102
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,900
information

103
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,950
and so the goal I set for myself was to
build these databases into a match in

104
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,310
the system's

105
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,500
so that they would they would be secure
if someone gets route on the system they

106
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,870
would be secure if someone walks in and
takes the hard disk they would be secure

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,200
if you happen to hire the wrong person
by mistake

108
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,880
okay here's a solution I found it was
part quite possible that you reuse a lot

109
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,130
of the old crypto protocols I found for
instance the classic UNIX password

110
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,320
database is a good early example for how
to do this

111
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,050
diffie-hellman shot md5 for all the
tools I needed

112
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm but this time around I wanted to
kinda recast the model so it's really

113
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,909
think when I was changing when I was

114
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,020
working at this idea was that you didn't
have

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,109
the fortress you could just use these
tools in a different way

116
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,790
so instead of keeping information one
can textual space

117
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:10,470
you're going to defuse it in this
mathematical space in only the right

118
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,680
person was going to be able to see that
information

119
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,300
so we're trying to think up the database
as instead of being is all same

120
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,800
Oracle with a small 0 it was going to be
a kind of this neutral mathematical

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,460
switch

122
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,360
where the data which is flow through it
and it wouldn't know what was going on

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,740
so those are fuel a metaphor so built
for my

124
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,800
along the way now her some advantages
ice claim for

125
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,820
approaching security this way first of
all it's cheaper

126
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,219
you don't need it let's face it if
you're going to buy or call it costs a

127
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,760
lot of money to hire someone

128
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,120
who knows how to install Oracle I still
haven't figured out night one of my

129
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,150
friends who

130
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,630
I guess works you know in the big three
other agency said yes

131
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,760
if used to work at Oracle he said he was
no man there's no way I can install that

132
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,789
you gotta really get someone who knows
what's going on

133
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,860
and he work for Oracle for five years

134
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,500
so if you use these solutions I claim
that

135
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,270
it's a lot easier to build them and it's
a lot easier to keep them secure

136
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,299
the other dreaded another big advantage
is there gonna be OS

137
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,620
independent you don't have to worry if
you've got holes in the operating system

138
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,370
and let's face it

139
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,590
I wouldn't want to try to secure any
operating system no matter how good it

140
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,740
is even if it's a

141
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,340
you know OpenBSD and the other advantage
I claim is that you don't have to worry

142
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,180
as much about your employees

143
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,820
and you have to worry about the people
that you give insider access to

144
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,800
now hear the disadvantage is that should
be pretty obvious when you work through

145
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,860
these examples

146
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,840
one is that there's no super user one of
the problems with disenfranchising your

147
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,620
insider's

148
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,800
it and taking away their power means
that they can help people

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,320
so if something goes wrong with your
system some cause upset I forgot my

150
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,480
password

151
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,740
some calls up in you know it's a good in
can someone who can't work the computer

152
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,090
for whatever reason

153
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,130
you know that you can't really help for
and I claim that

154
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,969
there are still many instances where
this is still a valuable solution and

155
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:05,530
when you do the calculus it's okay to go
through disenfranchising your super user

156
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,450
a.m. some other solutions I got here are
vulnerable to some kind of guessing

157
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,599
attacks but they're

158
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,530
ways to work around it and the problem
is that you essentially give your use or

159
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,889
more responsibility

160
00:08:15,889 --> 00:08:20,180
now I think that's something that's an
easy sell here at 2600 but

161
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,980
anyone who's dealt with a larger user
community means that there are some

162
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,530
limitations to how much

163
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,230
responsibility can put some people

164
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,930
okay so let's get let's go to the first
level example I wanted to show you

165
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:35,200
gonna start off with one-way functions
and I i suppose

166
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,630
love you are familiar with us but in
case you are I'm I just describe a

167
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,689
one-way function the way I'm thinking
about it

168
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,180
and that's if you have a function itself
can be a function f a VAX

169
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,660
that if you have axe it's very easy to
compute affects

170
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,520
but if you know affects it's very hard
to go backwards and figure out which

171
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,500
axe you stick in that function to get
the right value out

172
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,930
so it's gonna be something that's easy
to compute but hard to Denver

173
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,120
and it turns out that there are a number
of these functions that are out there

174
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,900
and the only limitation to this is that
the problem is that

175
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,079
we don't have any proof that their heart
and for

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,660
mathematics makes it very easy to prove
things

177
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,199
constructively but if you don't it's
very hard to prove that you can't do

178
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,050
something with mathematics

179
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,420
and you can it's like proving a negative
it's very hard to do

180
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,180
so one of the classic ones that you
might want to use today is shot 256

181
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,200
and there's a variation I call the age
Mac

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,570
and so that would be a good way to begin
one of the problems we've had recently

183
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,040
as

184
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,760
or it's in some ways it's not a problem
it's a very exciting time in mathematics

185
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,250
there are a lot of people who've been
poking holes in these

186
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,730
in is one-way functions and so they're
looking at shot on their finding out

187
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,800
anyways that they can

188
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,990
get around a and they ways that they can
in

189
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,570
not necessarily invert them but ways
they can it cause these things called

190
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,830
collision so defining these weaknesses

191
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,520
so UNF if you're going to be playing
around is one-way functions that make

192
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,610
sense to keep track of what the
researchers that's going on

193
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:07,250
you could also use kind of classic
private key or public key encryption to

194
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,010
give yourself

195
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,980
a1 a one-way function if you use private
public key encryption one of the things

196
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,330
you want you can do with that is you can
actually building a back door

197
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,640
so you may or may not want to have a
backdoor on your system but if you want

198
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,130
one

199
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,350
it's possible to do with the mathematics

200
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,810
now the last bullet point on the slide
says that

201
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,760
what your won the big advantages serve
one-way functions is that

202
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,640
even when you pass tough through this
one-way function in this case I'm using

203
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,130
a chance to develop

204
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,510
and you can test equality so you

205
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,770
if I give you two values you'll be able
to say

206
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,880
you may not know what those values are
but if they have the same hash value

207
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,470
which is the term used for

208
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,130
putting it through a one-way function
you can test that there is a sec

209
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:54,529
now the disadvantage that is you can't
really test greater than our less them

210
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,529
but thats

211
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,550
you know you can work through the
proofer why that is the case if you want

212
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,630
to

213
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:04,270
okay so that's the mathematics or very
skim

214
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,050
over the mathematics now see how you
could do this if you're in the real

215
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,250
world and you want to help people

216
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,400
build privacy protecting data bases

217
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,060
so here's a here's a story on an actor
which I find

218
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,480
which I think motivates why you want to
do this I'm

219
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,660
obviously Amazon's well known in the
there some people who sued them they

220
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,290
become kinda target because they have a
privacy

221
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,750
policy and there and people to sue them
for violating

222
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:32,250
that's been a problem for them but there
are a lot of other companies that are

223
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,730
out there one of them is called
crutchfield and I was about to give a

224
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,750
course on this topic

225
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,720
and two or three days beforehand I went
outside

226
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,450
and I when I saw my neighbor he was

227
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,700
sweeping up all this class ran his car
someone had broken into his car in stone

228
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,050
hysteria

229
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,020
I said while is terrible and I looked up
the street there was a pile of class

230
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,350
outside in my car

231
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,000
and I went up there and they weren't
able to take that Syria because it was

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,149
so complicated getting it out on the
dashboard

233
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:02,010
maybe someone came along but an both of
us

234
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,550
are both our cars were broken into and I
can tell you that we don't have

235
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,110
the nicest cars on the street by Annie
I'm

236
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,310
by any measure and we were wondering

237
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,740
she is he said yours he asked himself
rhetorically we know why would the pews

238
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,640
are two cars

239
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,069
and this took me a while I thought about
it and I realized both the bus had

240
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:22,540
bought

241
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,599
stereos from Crutchfield online

242
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,420
within the last six months now I have no
idea whether there's any

243
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,510
link between crutchfield and whoever
broke into our cars

244
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,100
but it as always struck me as something
that's suspicious

245
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,529
because crutchfield is a really nice
high-touch

246
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,649
I'm store they take very good care of
you when when I call them up I said they

247
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:44,540
said

248
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,959
in fact this is online when I was online
I typed in

249
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,970
you know what kinda car I had and it
said what these are the stereos that

250
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,200
will fit in your dash

251
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,649
and they presumably do this for my
neighbor to so not only did crutchfield

252
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,660
have my name and my address

253
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,199
and what kinda stereo I had bought from
them but it also knew which kind of car

254
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,720
it had been installed and it knew the
model year

255
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,399
and you know the address so it's quite
possible for someone

256
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,760
to find all the information from the
crutchfield database

257
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,230
now I don't know if someone if there's
an insider who's doing these kind of

258
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,210
things

259
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,380
but a.m. I think that it's you know

260
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,060
conceivable okay

261
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,110
so in my neighbor when his service was

262
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,270
when it once you realize esther was gone
he called a question about another one

263
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,040
so there's

264
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,699
not necessarily much incentive for
crutchfield to do a great job

265
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,720
home or protecting the the the
customer's information

266
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,779
okay so let's take a look at how you
could protect your customers here

267
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:46,580
if you really want to take care about
here's a table it looks like a database

268
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,149
table I might be able to make this
little bit bigger

269
00:13:50,149 --> 00:13:53,279
and we're losing a little bit because
I'm using this:

270
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,899
JavaScript version I've power point but

271
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:00,000
we've only lost one row of the bottom
the table and you can imagine is being a

272
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,040
database table it's going to be inside
of some customer store

273
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,260
and on the first column is the name of
the person who bought it and there are

274
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,160
few columns that are missing proper
superbly with the address on the

275
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,390
personal information

276
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,370
this is the item they bought which is
some para pants and the color and the

277
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,570
size

278
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,520
and so the simple way I claim that you
could go about fixing this is just to

279
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,510
say

280
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,790
instead of storing the customer's name
you can store

281
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,270
the hash out their name or the with the
result that putting their name through a

282
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,620
one-way function

283
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,180
so all of a sudden we the customer's
name is risk replaced with a number just

284
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,740
like

285
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,680
all of our names were it would have been
actually interesting if they had hatched

286
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,930
all the names instead of just giving us

287
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,010
numerical numbers with when you
registered

288
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,830
but a.m. wanna many things about this is

289
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,690
okay let's see what you can do with this
so obviously the column is now

290
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,600
gobbledygook

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,080
if you're an insider and you come to the
table and you say I want to figure out

292
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,790
who bought that character and she knows
I want to figure out

293
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,920
who bought that stereo that I wanna
steal or

294
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,600
you know it I guess it was an what was
that car movie the one where there to

295
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,050
steal all those cars

296
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,130
exactly like if you're if you're going
if your if you you know let's say your

297
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,040
database is really good you've got a
hundred thousand dollar cars in it

298
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,110
you know all of a sudden that first
column with your name

299
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:18,339
is now obscured

300
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,500
so

301
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,330
so would work too what good is that
database so obviously the insiders can

302
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,730
I'm poke around the database and figure
out something and figure out information

303
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,800
that they might abusive

304
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,560
crutchfield to do something like this
and it was the case that

305
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,570
that was how my data was stolen then
that would have prevented that kinda

306
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,930
crime

307
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,410
but there's still some advantages a
customer coming can come in

308
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,779
typing their name and they can find out
there was to pass purchases

309
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,200
so if I wanted to go back to a store and
I wanted to prove that I had purchased

310
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,529
something I could type in my name and
then all of a sudden the database

311
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,019
would release that information and would
become clear it would bring it into the

312
00:15:59,019 --> 00:15:59,709
clear

313
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,180
and I could prove that I had bought
something in the past I could get

314
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,640
warranty service on it

315
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,089
if I happen to like a pair of pants and
I wanted to know what what the right

316
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:10,440
size was and I wanted to order a new
pair of

317
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,880
online without trying them on again I
couldn't do that

318
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:19,310
I could I could all of a sudden all of
my past information becomes open to me

319
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:26,050
now term

320
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:28,920
I think there's also something kinda
interesting about this the translucency

321
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,560
this affect that i'm talking about here
still

322
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,430
balances the different needs the
marketing department is not frozen out

323
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,920
one of the things that you often hear is
like well you know the stores need to

324
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,810
keep this information about who buys
what thing

325
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,450
so they know that if you bought the Red
Hat and you've got the blue

326
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,890
pants then they're gonna buy more of
those together they'll be able to

327
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,209
understand technology they'll be able to
use all their data mining

328
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:56,779
well what's going on here is that that
marketing department is not locked out

329
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,320
so they can still do their job they just
don't know the name its associated

330
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,760
all of a sudden everyone's name has been
replaced with this numerical pseudonym

331
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,309
so database mining is still possible you
can still match up record you can still

332
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,530
find out who

333
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,069
who are your good customers it's just
you can you don't know their names

334
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:18,020
and if they come back in and the typing
their name on there checking out for

335
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,059
whatever reason

336
00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:22,449
you can flag you say all these guys a
popular customer maybe we want to give

337
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,209
them some freebies you can do all those
kind of gimmicks that the marketing

338
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:26,630
department talks about

339
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,990
you just can't figure out what their
names are

340
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,450
now as I mentioned at the beginning that
there are limits to how you might

341
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,910
to this system i mean one of the
problems is that it doesn't stop all

342
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,460
snoops

343
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,640
if you know the person's name you want
to find out what they fought

344
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,280
then you can look things up you may not
be able to look for

345
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,639
you know the the car you want to steal
and Fig and just

346
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,640
figure out who that person is there but
you can look up

347
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,480
with you know who what bob jones's
purchased at the store in the past

348
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,610
and and I'm gonna to I'm gonna fix that
in a couple slides

349
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,740
and you there's also you could use a
phone book attack

350
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,549
so I guess I discover these things so
let's fix those

351
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,820
the those problems by adding passwords

352
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,980
well and said if you notice here I got
the same kinda table I talked about in

353
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,830
the past year

354
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,470
but this time I had a different thing if
you look at the at the header uv-vis

355
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,830
table all of a sudden I'm hashing not
just the name but the name

356
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,649
and a password so if you've got a
database that's particularly valuable

357
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,580
you can ask you for Cindy to type in a
personal identification number some kind

358
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,049
of secret that they keep calling

359
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:38,290
themselves so the example what kind of
cooked up here

360
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,070
is one of the pharmacy I think that this
is quite useful because pharmacies have

361
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,389
lots of different requirements

362
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,770
I've keeping track of what their
customers I'm purchase

363
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,260
for a number of different reasons one
they want to help the customer they

364
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,330
could because they wanna

365
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:54,590
may be warned them about dangerous drug
interactions

366
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,689
they have to do it for legal purposes
cuz the the I guess the

367
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,580
DEA wants to track certain drugs to make
sure people aren't

368
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,350
you know who knows what they're doing
with it but you know some reason after

369
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,470
track

370
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:10,030
and but they're also ok their downsides
to this

371
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,500
if you have drugs like oxycontin or
whatever rush limbaugh was taking or

372
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,700
you know trucks like that those are
things that have black market value

373
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,650
and so if you have this database you
might know whose house you wanna break

374
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,260
into

375
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,270
and who was there that effect on a
baltimore where I live the the

376
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:29,530
sportscaster I mean this is something
that's happened you if you end up on TV

377
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,700
radio

378
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,020
but the sportscaster was caught breaking
into his neighbor's house

379
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,020
to take their drugs because he was
addicted to them the same way that Rush

380
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,210
Limbaugh's

381
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,940
and it so so clearly there's something
very powerful at work here

382
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,179
so this database as result has dangerous
value as well

383
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:49,190
and so maybe someone would break into
the pharmacy or break into the pharmacy

384
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,090
computer

385
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,350
and use that to steal drugs so for use
in approach like this all of a sudden we

386
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,170
have this translucent system

387
00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:00,340
where customers can come in they can
type in their name their data and their

388
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,260
your password they can be sure there are
many dangerous drug interactions

389
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,690
but they don't have to worry about their
personal information being compromised

390
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,020
now how would you use this one other
people said well you know you still have

391
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,090
to keep this information for the DEA

392
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,590
the way I can imagine this working in a
in a real environment

393
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,809
is that the local pharmacy would have
the local copy of the database is

394
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:23,260
translucent form

395
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:27,010
but they would have been a clear version
that would be stored in a really secure

396
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,150
location

397
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,260
so all of a sudden the local pharmacy
doesn't have to worry about having an

398
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,820
Oracle expert on hand it make sure that
it's truly and breakable

399
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,760
and the local pharmacy doesn't have to
worry about someone taking the hardest

400
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,309
a local pharmacy doesn't have to worry
about someone getting root on their

401
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,240
machine

402
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,490
but the all the information that they
need to keep for the DEA is Captain that

403
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,559
you know Iron Mountain Mike environment
or vault or something like that

404
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,960
now of course there's the downside to
this which i think in this case is still

405
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,730
worth it

406
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,720
when I do the calculus in my head you
have forgotten passwords all of a sudden

407
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,330
you don't have a super user

408
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:07,199
and so you must be able to withstand
lost records now my feeling is that

409
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,210
you know it in a case like this

410
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,570
it's not too bad it's not a problem for
people to create a new identity for

411
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,409
themselves

412
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,110
so when you're hashing up the name that
user name and your password if someone

413
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,559
comes up with a new password

414
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:23,260
that in essence cue creates a new
identity and those true identities won't

415
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,790
be linked together but

416
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,918
I think that it's okay to give people
the responsibility I think they're

417
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,130
probably people who

418
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:32,400
disagree with me on that but I think you
you know whenever you're

419
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,830
architect in these systems you can your
you're forced to make these kinda

420
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,889
decisions and trade-offs about usability
verses

421
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,799
I'm privacy and in this case this is how
I would choose it

422
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,290
but will show you another the next
example I have is

423
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,129
I think it's even more clear that it's
okay to just live with forgotten

424
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,309
passwords

425
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:55,770
a.m. this is in the next example but
it's a kinda been

426
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,250
there people have said you know what
happened when you deal about hunt

427
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,000
there are lots of other problems that
people have sometimes they type

428
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,220
uppercase instead of lower case there
can

429
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,440
other cases where they forget things

430
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,540
um there are a lot of different ways you
can fix that

431
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,960
if you so care if you want to do that
you can use things like forcing

432
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,150
people to only type in uppercase by
converting everything

433
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,299
upper case in stripping away the spaces
before you happy

434
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,220
you can use you can force them to you
something like

435
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,490
soundex codes I don't know if you guys
are familiar with it but with a sound

436
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,760
Xcode is something developed from the
70's

437
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,270
and the idea is that any word if you
have two words that are homonyms that

438
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,379
they sound the same but are spelled
differently

439
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,030
they should still come out with the same
code so if you look at the Maryland

440
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,840
drivers license the first four

441
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,139
characters are the soundex code for your
name

442
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,070
which in my case is w 560 so if you
spelled my name with ay y

443
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:59,830
any are incident ayne are it both those
versions will come up with the same

444
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,928
sound Xcode

445
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:04,460
and I know that there are lots of people
in the and the three-letter

446
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,980
agencies that are spending their time
coming up with some tax cuts for Arab

447
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,790
names

448
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,320
so there are lots of different
techniques that are out there for coming

449
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,730
up with our kind a kind of canonical
forms

450
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,549
for words or names were things that deal
with forgetfulness or the fact that

451
00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:20,230
people spell their name differently or
they

452
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,169
don't always use the same for another
solution you can do is that if you have

453
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:25,130
an

454
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,820
but so you have Enfield's you know that
identify a person

455
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,030
you can hash together cave all

456
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,520
each every case I some sets you can
choose k of them

457
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:40,200
a fall and you can haz them up all
independently so if people get k out of

458
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,289
n correct

459
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:47,650
then you're still going to be able to
look them up in the database

460
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,919
okay there there there are actually two
more example so this is the library an

461
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:51,700
example

462
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,780
so one other problems that librarians
have had is that

463
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,918
a.m. the to keep all these records of
what people are reading

464
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,549
and librarians I think now actually want
to keep that information

465
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,820
private because they're worried about
say terrorists breaking into the library

466
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,490
and

467
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,960
and blackmailing say some other readers

468
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,610
a.m. so I know that librarians are

469
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,010
very they really want to keep the this
is one the reasons they want to keep

470
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,350
everything private matter

471
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:23,549
there but whether fighting for the
privacy rights to the readers

472
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:27,639
so let's see how you could use this with
a translucent database

473
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,710
I'm what you could do you could cash up

474
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,150
the the title and with a person's
password

475
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,210
and you would keep the replacement cost
in the clear so when you come to check

476
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,880
out would give your name you say I'm

477
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,940
primary Smith and the computer would
dutifully

478
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,490
look at the book and say oh here's the
title or here's the ID number of the

479
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,120
book

480
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,980
and we take your pain and it would have
asked that and would store that the

481
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,850
database

482
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,419
and which store the replacement cost and
I probably should put the due date on

483
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:55,200
this

484
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,760
because it would make more sense but if
the time comes

485
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,190
you take the book out and when you
return it you would return it they were

486
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,280
dutifully scan it they could compute the
hash function and they could remove that

487
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,960
line from the database and if you don't
return it after 21 days or whenever

488
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,059
its its do then all of a sudden they
would know that you

489
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,980
Mary Smith does $14.95 and they were
done you for it and do whatever

490
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,000
librarians to get the it rebuild their

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,500
inventory a.m.

492
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,400
and and what are the advantages to this
is that if you're such a terrorist in

493
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,539
you wanna blackmail Mary Smith maybe
mary smith works at a local military

494
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:30,480
base or has

495
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,400
access to classified information then
but librarians have prevented

496
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,510
that information from from going out the
door anyone who breaks into the library

497
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,160
system or anyone who

498
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,230
is a you know maybe steals the hard disk

499
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:47,460
if we got a lot of problems with stone
you know just stolen machines

500
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,890
maybe somebody will keep a copy on their
laptop its own

501
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,030
this is a way librarians can defend
against the terrorists

502
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,879
what's so you want to make things even
more secure you can turn the crank again

503
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,049
you could start hashing people's names

504
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:03,590
and passwords or names and books they
take out so all of a sudden in order to

505
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,660
get

506
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,440
there's not even anything recognizable
here except the replacement cost

507
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,910
and downside to doing this for the flip
side to do this is you have to take the

508
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,110
cash in advance

509
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,830
to put in escrow because there's no way
you can done the people if they don't

510
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,740
return it

511
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,720
but if you want to take out a book you
have to put up $14.95 it goes in escrow

512
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,789
and when you bring the book back you
type in your name you and you you show

513
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:26,990
them the title and they go OK and then a
task both those

514
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,289
and then they can delete that line and
they can give your cashback

515
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:33,610
so if you're if you really want to be
careful about things if you wanna make

516
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,580
sure that there's no information in the
database at all

517
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,520
then you can turn the crank that many
times

518
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,809
a.m. one of the challenges I had

519
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,379
with someone what someone is reading my
book in it came to me said well you know

520
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,470
this is all interesting

521
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,580
but you know why would anyone use this
and someone actually

522
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,629
someone actually wrote a couple pieces
kinda saying well this is all nice and

523
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,330
at the real sense

524
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:04,340
but is it really practical and so I've
been trying to push the fact that what

525
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,039
I'm really doing here is just practical
work

526
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,789
and its practical evangelism it's not
you know anything

527
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:14,879
it's not really that hard to do and what
are the challenges I had with his friend

528
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,850
of mine was he said

529
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,980
that's what I'll prove it to you I will
show that I can do

530
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,370
everything that you at Amazon could do
with a translucent system

531
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,640
so everything I and the reason I want to
do that is cuz I think

532
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,799
Amazon is a good example of a store that
cause

533
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,840
out of its way to do a great job for
their customers and by building is huge

534
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,600
dossiers and I wanted to show that you
could do that

535
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,890
and I went through I went through your
line by line all the features I can

536
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,260
imagine that they do and I

537
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,690
I could do all of them but Wong and so

538
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,350
it and is the simplest technique is just
use your email and password as a

539
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,919
surrogate

540
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,130
and so that you know when you show up
the next time in you get your email in

541
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,559
your password to login to the Amazon

542
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,950
they would be able to look up in their
database is both a surrogate and they be

543
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,240
able to do whatever brilliance they do
suggest the books that you might want to

544
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,350
look at that could customize your page
with that surrogate

545
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,940
now that takes care of a lot of the
different prize a lot of different stuff

546
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,539
that Amazon does but when you do about
your shipping address for the nice

547
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,210
things about Amazon as you going to you
don't have to type in your shipping

548
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,880
address each time you don't have to type
in your credit card number

549
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,880
my claim is what the way Amazon should
handle that is that they should use a

550
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,770
slightly different version of the hash
function

551
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,039
with the different key or something like
that and you should encrypt your great

552
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:30,908
day

553
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,480
so the next time you show up they can't
figure out your address

554
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,510
they can't figure out your credit card
number until you log in

555
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,100
and that gives them the ability to be
cryptic and they might keep it around

556
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,309
until they ship the package and once
that package goes out the door

557
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:49,850
or until they print a shipping label
then the computers can't can't forget

558
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:51,200
the information

559
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,490
and I think that you know they may not
want to forget the information

560
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,640
for whatever reasons but it would be in
their best interest

561
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,679
to delete the information because they
don't have to worry about it anymore

562
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,880
they don't have to worry about the
responsibility

563
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,200
the one feature that Amazon has and

564
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,270
I think it's questionable that it's a
future is they spam you

565
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,049
with suggestions for new books and a
pedi charge the publisher for this of

566
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:17,289
the publisher comes out with a new
version of something they want to

567
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,400
advertise it you can go to

568
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,330
in go to Amazon and you can pay 205
dollars and they will spam

569
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,520
all the people who bought similar books
in the past

570
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,129
so I couldn't figure out easy way to
duplicate that with the simple systems

571
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,350
like bill so far

572
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,590
but perhaps there's a mathematical way
out there so if you guys are interested

573
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:39,429
in a promise of you might wanna tactile

574
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:44,429
but you know is that really a barbers in
the future

575
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,580
I wanna show you a few more exam but
this is the

576
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,820
another example this is one the ones I
was pointing to it doesn't really matter

577
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,039
if you have to create a new account

578
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,908
and and this came this came up

579
00:29:56,909 --> 00:30:00,000
in a conversation my wife and her friend
you know

580
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,070
say 1998 and

581
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:07,110
her friend said would be great if you
could go to database

582
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,880
are you know website would tell you
which when your baby sitters are gonna

583
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,700
be free on Friday night

584
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,049
because you know to her is a real hassle
if you want to try to get someone for

585
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,940
Friday night she call it crests and

586
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,340
maybe Chris would take a day or two to
call back and Chris would say you know i

587
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,770
i cant go because I've got day

588
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,840
and then you know she would call someone
else and you know

589
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,830
maybe we take a day to be all this phone
tag in between and she's waste all this

590
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,230
time trying to talk to people

591
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,440
who work can be free anyways so her
ideal

592
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,200
website was one that would tell her
immediately who was gonna be free on

593
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,340
Friday night

594
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,700
but there's a real and you know this was
1998 now I was immediately thinking

595
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,850
that is a hundred million dollar idea
and

596
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,210
so I started thinking about for one I
realized

597
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,710
but is it really and do I want that
responsibility

598
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,900
so all of a sudden you're gonna have to
schedule and yours your computer your

599
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,130
databases can be filled with the
schedule

600
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:05,289
with a up all these fifteen-year-olds
and you really want to keep track of

601
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:07,190
which parents are gonna could be outta
the house

602
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,990
do you want this responsible your
shoulder and I realized with this would

603
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,110
be a good opportunity to try to test
this lil bit more

604
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,580
so I'm in trying to solve bigger

605
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,990
and you can kind of see the tables and
some other are cut off

606
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:27,340
and I apologize for not being able to
work this javascript will work better

607
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,450
but this is kind of a simple example of
how you might use two tables

608
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:34,809
and you could allow the data the
babysitters and the the parents

609
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:39,120
to to you'll find each other when the
time is right

610
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,390
but your knock this the center's
information is not gonna be available to

611
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:46,100
insiders is not gonna be generally
available the center's gonna have

612
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,630
control over who sees the schedule for
Friday night

613
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:52,700
so we have a table on the left on the
table on the left has

614
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,169
you know three columns like is the
person free or

615
00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:00,059
busy at a particular date range no start
date and a

616
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,720
kinda coding and the

617
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,299
the key for that table is the the
sender's name

618
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:11,760
and the password hash together so that's
the kind of information that the center

619
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,799
keeps up-to-date

620
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,860
Center maybe it syncs with the Centers
Palm Pilot or whatever you do

621
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,799
and essentially thus it is going to be
free and want to advertise for work the

622
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,139
center can put the

623
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,990
the free slot there if they want to
block out time they would block it out

624
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:30,330
in that table now how does a sitter
control who sees that

625
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,230
and with the sitter controls this is by
saying well you know some parents say

626
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:37,250
geez we really liked working with you
you know we need you would like to be

627
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,490
able to see your schedule

628
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,580
in a sense of what what what your
password

629
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,639
and then a sitter goes and puts entry
and

630
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,380
the table on the right and this is just
got to this has two columns

631
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,419
the first one is the same as the foreign
is the key

632
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,610
to the table on the left which is the
sender's name and password

633
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,220
and the second one is the parents name
in the past the parents password hash

634
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,130
together

635
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,779
so in the parents come in the parents
will say go to the website of typing

636
00:33:02,779 --> 00:33:04,419
their name their password

637
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:07,750
and that will give that than that
database will search through

638
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:11,159
the car the far right column and it will
then linked to

639
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,350
you will be able to Lincoln figure out
which centers they're able to see and

640
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,500
from that information they'll be able to
pull it out

641
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,640
and their lot they're a lot more ways
that you can

642
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,230
turn the crank with this technology him
and I

643
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,679
I've actually build systems that have 45
tables that are all linked together with

644
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,470
these

645
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,940
I'm these hash keys and and they as the
person types in certain information

646
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,690
unlocks the other information so I
contend that this is a really

647
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,900
nice elegant solution to to a difficult
problem

648
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,320
what we've got here is this database
that protects the data the babysitters

649
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,750
and protect their schedules and from
anyone who happens to get root anyone

650
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,950
who's an insider

651
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,500
anyone who happens to break in and that
is a problem in a lot of these places

652
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,789
but it still allows the babysitter
control what information a parent sees

653
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:05,450
now if the babysitter wants to cut
someone off they can take out the entry

654
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,789
in the two and the right cable

655
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:10,409
or the babysitter could just keep a
different identity by changing

656
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:13,500
the password or changing the name are
changing both

657
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,050
all of a sudden the babysitter can
create a different Anne the babysitter

658
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,649
could have two or three identities

659
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,969
and the the family that the babysitter
doesn't like to work with as much

660
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,730
or the machine you know the baby sir
Mike about a different

661
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:30,040
schedule to so the babysitter has lots
and lots of control with this database

662
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:34,540
and the people who are the insiders have
no control what's going on

663
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,300
no I think this is actually a nice
solution in this case because

664
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,720
babysitting is not a particularly
lucrative and

665
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,990
world and so there's not a lot of money
to support a business like this and this

666
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:47,480
is something I realized and

667
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,869
and I think we all realized with that
all a hundred million dollar ideas from

668
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:52,139
the late 90's

669
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,859
you know are don't necessarily have all
this money to support them

670
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,869
but that's it in this case that makes
the solution even more valuable you're

671
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,619
not going to be able to afford

672
00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:04,650
all of this higher highly qualified
Oracle

673
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:08,470
sys admins the day the DB's to maintain
your database

674
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,020
you're gonna be able to do this with a
lot cheaper database you not gonna have

675
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:18,020
to worry about keeping things as
unbreakable

676
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:23,359
I'm interest put forward a little bit
more quickly so we have time for

677
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,049
questions but steganography can create
and tear databases and you can read

678
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:29,440
about this if you're curious

679
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,890
one on the thoughts I had is that you
know they're sometimes were you wanna

680
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,250
database to reveal a certain amount of
information

681
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,770
everybody but you want more precise
information to be revealed

682
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,530
only the select people and I can't
imagine a world where

683
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:45,859
you had these locations a naval ships

684
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:49,509
and you want to give out kind of course
information to

685
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:53,010
most people but you only want to go
about finding information to

686
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,180
people who knew are people who have a
right

687
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,310
right a reason to know because that
could be used for target

688
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,820
and you know the course information
might be useful for planners are general

689
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:07,270
people are maybe even a passed on to
family members so they know that

690
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:10,589
you know because people like to know
that there loved one is

691
00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:13,700
somewhere in the Persian Gulf but you
don't have to give the exact location so

692
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,849
it could be

693
00:36:14,849 --> 00:36:17,910
to be targeted and the way I did this as
I use just some

694
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,080
an error vector that was driven by a
hash code

695
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,910
you can also use back doors if you
wanted to know I mentioned at the

696
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,250
beginning that their

697
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,240
that you well as defining one-way
functions that the standard way is to

698
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,510
use something like shahar the synthetic

699
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:38,230
one-way functions but you could use a
public key cryptography

700
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,390
one of the things you could do is you
can use a.m.

701
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,819
public key cryptography and when people
want to use a hash function use the

702
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,880
the encryption function with public key
cryptographic but only a few people have

703
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,300
the private key that can use 2d crib
stuff

704
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,869
so wanted a nice advantages a symmetric
cryptography is that you can share one

705
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:57,910
other part 1 part of a pair

706
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,920
and this is cool but computationally
more intensive but yes

707
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,150
still I think useful and that

708
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,040
what are the advantages of this
technique is that most in the

709
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,170
computation is done at the client

710
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,240
so you don't need as have to your server
farm to maintain

711
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,290
this kind of security

712
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,369
now the downside is that you have to
keep a lot more bits and

713
00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,830
you know it's a pain in the neck

714
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,920
the secret sharing there's a lot of
other standard

715
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,190
repair techniques where you can take a
secret you can split up into four

716
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:30,020
different

717
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:34,480
databases and all four or and all for
the people who control those databases

718
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,130
have to agree to release the information

719
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,839
and I think that's pretty well-known

720
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:44,549
okay so I think that there's

721
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,490
a lot of work that needs to be done
right now and if you're interested in

722
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,410
this these are some

723
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,089
directions you might wanna go down a.m.

724
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:55,109
are we really using the best hash
functions and

725
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:59,049
is age Makwana the best solutions

726
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:02,380
are there other ways that we can use
these hash functions to produce

727
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:07,119
what I've done here a.m. can we defend
against collisions if you look at the

728
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,430
kind of exciting research that's come
out about finding these weaknesses in

729
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,029
these one-way functions

730
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,210
what they do is that these people don't
break the one-way function

731
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:20,099
completely they don't come up with an
algorithm that allows you to say

732
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:25,530
if I have affects I can always run this
computer and I can figure out what axis

733
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,440
where they come up with is as weakness
and make what they say is they look for

734
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,580
collisions that is they find two values

735
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,509
X&Y that hash to the same I'm value

736
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:39,680
well there are ways we can work around
that we can use

737
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,060
we can define the structure a vaccine
the structural why

738
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,670
which forces them forces the people who
are using these algorithms

739
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:51,060
to and kinda breaks them so for instance
if you force

740
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:55,259
that that the the input to the

741
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,400
hash function should always have a
structure that's well-defined

742
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,170
if people find these questions that will
make may not be

743
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,670
in in fact it's almost certain not to be
in that structure

744
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,849
now you know if you're more interested
in some of these other things like Raven

745
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:10,530
encryption

746
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:13,770
where it breaks it but I don't think
that I think that's a little bit

747
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:17,220
over the top but I think

748
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,089
some other more crucial things that we
have to do for it

749
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:26,299
our social engineer what we I think I
think all of us feel this way

750
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,580
about data and I think some people are
moving over

751
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,859
and changing their their opinions of it
but

752
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,799
most the people who work with computers
have this kind a pack rat mentality

753
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,770
if the information if they see the
information coming through their system

754
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,960
they wanna put in their logs they wanna
keep that information as long as they

755
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,510
can

756
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,550
because you're never sure when you're
gonna need it again and so they have

757
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,140
huge

758
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:50,400
you know questions a backup tapes and

759
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,150
you know that and that this is i think
what drives a lot of the kinda

760
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:58,540
you know low-grade Big Brother kinda
snooping and is that's a sad man's

761
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,140
like to just poke around it like to keep
all the information in case they

762
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,430
in case they could use again so when
I've given these talks to some

763
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,669
and places there a lot of people come up
with a say well

764
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,440
you know we need to help people are we
might need that information in the

765
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,430
future and we have to keep it

766
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,220
and if I the point my point is that you
don't have to keep it

767
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,119
you can often get by without it and
you'll see that actually lawyers or get

768
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,420
our

769
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,099
are figuring this out from the beginning
like a lot of Corp rose

770
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:29,390
corporations now have these these
blanket rules like you're not allowed to

771
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:29,650
keep

772
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:33,560
email after a month which in our kind of
silly in a way

773
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,170
and the really stupid because you
there's there are a few emails that you

774
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,290
might want to keep

775
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,670
but the reason they have those like a
provision is because they're worried

776
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,740
about subpoenas they're worried about
the cost of going through all their

777
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,619
systems and

778
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,880
and delivering every subpoena that or
every email that fits a particular

779
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,070
description

780
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:52,160
and the subpoenas are just so absolutely
broad

781
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,828
that it's a real hassle to try to

782
00:40:55,829 --> 00:41:00,150
to comply with them and order and give
up whatever the court orders

783
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,170
and you know many times I guess today
you don't even get a subpoena you still

784
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,369
order to deliver this information

785
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:08,160
well that's why lawyers are into
destroying all this information and I

786
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,680
think sys admins could learn something
from the lawyers

787
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,190
mission learned that if you keep the
information around you also have a

788
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,900
responsibility to guard

789
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,829
and if you were just wipe your data more
often you don't have to worry about

790
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:21,359
someone stealing your laptop

791
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,069
and I think businesses still don't see
the need but I think they're more more

792
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:26,270
lawsuits that are changing that

793
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,660
so you know I'm encouraging people to
examine the solutions because I think

794
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,810
they have good practical uses I think we
can build its kinda

795
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:38,000
anti-big brother -ism into these
databases and it's good for

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,290
for many many situations and effective
one group I haven't even using in a

797
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,359
strange way they're trying to enforce a
contract

798
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:48,619
I guess there's these two companies and
one of them has the data and the other

799
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:49,040
one

800
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,720
wants to license the data and pay them
only a small amount of monthly fee

801
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,609
and the first one is worried that the
second one is somehow going to cash the

802
00:41:55,609 --> 00:41:58,359
data and they're worried that it would
be abused in the future

803
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:02,230
and eventually would need the first one
anymore so they're using a translucent

804
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:03,280
solution

805
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,560
fix that but I think overall Mike

806
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,190
the main point to this talk is that that
we can build the systems we can keep

807
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:16,510
information locked up in a way that only
the right users can get at it

808
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:20,290
and all OVA casual users the insiders
the snoops the people who get

809
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:24,859
ru can't get it and this is a ideal
solution for my people

810
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:31,859
so if anyone has questions I'm happily
taken

811
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:38,800
presentation appreciate that

812
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,010
from what I've noticed like

813
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,260
you know if you charge your credit card
debt there is no new church the bank

814
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:47,730
will

815
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:52,820
cover you on you know they'll take care
right but if they lose your information

816
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,200
you suffer from identity theft that's
not really the problem

817
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:00,720
that's your problem right so I mean less
to massive

818
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,130
fact wishes which is stored um so

819
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:07,540
I mean it's not really viable for
businesses to you

820
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,240
spent a lot of money and security when
it's its exposure that they don't

821
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,170
really people so how do you feel about
that now the question is

822
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,140
like a nudist your presentation at the
fifth was pretty similar

823
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:22,839
typeof conserves and will be seen change
like since the

824
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:26,880
produce a look to the first from and in
the south

825
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,220
the first one is me you're absolutely
right that businesses

826
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:34,330
don't have don't feel the pressure
because and that's partially because if

827
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:35,630
information leaks out

828
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:39,570
most the time you don't know where it
came from and yeah we hear these kind of

829
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,570
high-profile kinda discussions and they
say

830
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:47,390
pose some laptop with although
information from the VFW

831
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,859
leaked out but but that doesn't
necessarily mean that it was used in a

832
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,470
bad way and it could be someone if
someone's identity is stolen it could be

833
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,050
in some other leak that caused it

834
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:59,230
so there's not that there's not a really
good cause and effect and his point i

835
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,630
think is quite correct is that

836
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,900
the businesses don't feel the heat no I
think they should feel the heat and I

837
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,610
think part of the reason the this
disclosure laws from California are

838
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,290
are good is because it forces them to at
least think the consequences are

839
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,310
protected a day

840
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,370
and if they feel that way I think they
can use this solution

841
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:22,710
a so on to the second one he pointed out
that I gave

842
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,870
pretty close to the same talk couple
years ago and

843
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,810
I think that's because the people who
are organizing this like the topic and

844
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,009
they asked me to give it again

845
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:38,010
a.m. what's changed since then I find
that there's more and more interest

846
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,800
about this and for instance

847
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,880
I was you know I get more invitations

848
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,100
to give this talk that I did two years
ago

849
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,850
the mathematics I put in here are not is
not any

850
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,540
different I do know that there is some
interesting work that's going on for

851
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,240
instance

852
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,060
if you're into as whatever their

853
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:03,440
I guess transitive

854
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,030
encryption there there's a some
encryption where subscription functions

855
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,820
where a few

856
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,750
encrypt with key a before chibi you end
up with the same result as if you

857
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,380
encrypt with

858
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,900
chibi before key a and those kind of
solutions

859
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,220
are very useful in this environment and
I'm

860
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:24,160
curious about other people were CMU her
doing research in this and a few other

861
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,370
places I can send you pointers to the
research

862
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:29,450
if you give me your card talk to me
afterwards but

863
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,610
it just seemed a little bit too
confusing to put into the talk right now

864
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,220
so I haven't done that for that to me is
what I'm most excited about is when

865
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,510
you're using those kinda encryption
functions that way because

866
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:43,090
all of a sudden people don't have to do
things in the same order and there a lot

867
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:44,840
of interesting algorithms for say

868
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,690
dealing cards were playing poker online
and that you could also do interesting

869
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:49,790
privacy things

870
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:56,790
with that those kinda encryption
functions Google

871
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,620
now offers Senate spreadsheets can

872
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,970
sheer what would be the risking

873
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,110
and water the you know using sharing
information

874
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,960
you know how easy would it be to work
with something

875
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,640
well I think I i think im Google wanted
to Google put put a password on

876
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,460
the the spreadsheet data and I don't
know if they have a min certainly the

877
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:23,380
people there are all talented enough to
do this if they want to or

878
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,860
they have the time and but there's no
reason why that sharing can be done is

879
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,130
kinda translucent way

880
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:34,040
where the data that's stored at Google
is useless to anyone who doesn't have

881
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,560
that password and I would just be a
simple straightforward you serve

882
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,210
encryption

883
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:41,580
but I think it would be a nice use in
this case them

884
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,900
I don't know if Google cares enough to
do that you often get this kind have

885
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,200
you always got these nice platitudes
about not being evil

886
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,820
but when you read through their privacy
rules you know it's pretty clear that

887
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,920
their feeling is they can do whatever
they want with with your data

888
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,380
and I I'll tell you a story

889
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,980
a friend of mine works at Google and he
I sometimes tell II some complaints his

890
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:04,850
way

891
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,980
you know he seems to like it because he
responds immediately and he says I'll

892
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,450
will try to fix that blogger whatever so
he's like my

893
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,640
and he seems to care when I seven the
stuff so it's good and there was one

894
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,759
time I was looking for

895
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,260
email i forward a lot on my email to eg

896
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,780
gmail account there and I couldn't find
it and usually Google's when the better

897
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,980
source for me looking up back emails and
it just wasn't there

898
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:33,210
and so then finally I found it on my
hard disk I found another copy other

899
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,850
and no matter what I did I couldn't find
it in my gmail which really surprise me

900
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:37,799
because

901
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,450
it's clear that they want to keep track
of you know

902
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:46,160
they want to be the central file for all
your email so I wrote him a complaint no

903
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,220
goes well tell me more information so
you get so I sent him the message id:

904
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,260
which is a a perfect identifiers and

905
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,880
within a half hour I got an email back
saying all that was batted deleted

906
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,070
because it was right it was

907
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,010
classified as spam and so it only state
in the system for 30 days

908
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:06,170
so you know even though

909
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:10,070
they're keeping log files have all the
stuff and even though

910
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,480
I don't know where that email is even
though it looks like it's gone to me

911
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,750
they know when it was deleted what time
it was deleted and where and

912
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:21,090
you know white was deleted and so you
know who knows what's going on by would

913
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,570
I would encourage them to use more
systems like this

914
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:26,790
if anything just because I think it
would be better for I'm

915
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:33,370
all the users to push is kinda control
to the edges

916
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,420
there are certain places where it's been
legislated

917
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,410
of privacy and health care is tremendous
place with this

918
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:45,240
technology would really fit in on banks
might not care or Amazon might not care

919
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:49,420
my with the HIPAA regulations partisan
of a lot of people that have

920
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,810
access to specific medical information
about

921
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:56,870
what you had done that don't need to
know your name in

922
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,770
all that other stuff for statistics so
there's really I think a lot about

923
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,500
locations for this

924
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,880
I think and legal now you know all the
privacy in

925
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,900
litigation see the medical stuff kinda
interesting when i do. it

926
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,060
because I talked this a lot of people
and its it's not so cut-and-dried

927
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:16,470
obviously you're right that the
principal would be wonderful many

928
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,540
cases because you want to protect the
stuff but the the

929
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,720
one objection I can't really deal with
is so what if you come in your

930
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,720
your in a calm or you know your knocked
out or

931
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,000
you you're in an ambulance like they
don't have the data

932
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,600
so you know you can't reveal your pin
number your password and so

933
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,710
that's a problem and

934
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:39,990
and they often say things like you know
I want the doctors want the data right

935
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:40,740
away

936
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,380
they don't wanna wait you know half hour
but then you get into your tiered

937
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:47,700
levels have information there are so
many people that access details

938
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,000
a hospital stay that you had five years
ago

939
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,330
for statistics for revenue recovery for

940
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,060
million different things and there's
just something that's looks at work in

941
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,670
that

942
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,010
yeah that would be terrific I think so
and there are a lot of people have done

943
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:01,540
a lot to me

944
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,259
research on this I know for instance
that there's these rules about releasing

945
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,070
medical study information

946
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:10,690
they're kinda need the they have kinda
principles like the data you release

947
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,040
about a person can

948
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,150
has to be. win

949
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,520
is going to define a set and that's the
site the number people in that set has

950
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,440
to be greater than five or ten

951
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,680
so if you give say the street number you
can go if you give the street number

952
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,910
industry

953
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,069
you can do something like that new york
city because they're gonna be maybe a

954
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,360
thousand people who live

955
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,230
at you know you know a hundred and or
1313 Mockingbird Lane

956
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,330
but if you go out to the countryside and

957
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,680
you know there may only be five people
who are living on a whole an entire

958
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,879
streets you can even keep the street
name much less the number

959
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,810
in a database and so it's common
interest and principal

960
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:56,830
during work questions

961
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:59,830
okay well I really enjoyed being here at

962
