17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,360
I get the laptop on the screen over here

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,360
I guess at the turn it on

19
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,110
at work

20
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,750
decisions as this first

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,610
say whoever owns his laptop I guess is
the password necessarily get online

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:47,610
said right left

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,400
so

24
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,400
we'll have fifteen minutes here

25
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,080
to

26
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,460
alright

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,060
so its SVN

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,030
so I've

29
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,420
mortgage so I've done the coronation for

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,520
I'm fair hope for the best up for
conferences now ans the

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,800
requirements talk about typically chains
though they do buser

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,900
increase on we didn't have wireless at

33
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,800
million miles have a very fat its UK yep
somewhat

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,190
summer have our listing it's okay to end
during

35
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,430
fifth hope and saw this conference I
think while spin

36
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,870
if iraq solid but something

37
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,440
additional requirements we've had for
this to this conference was

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,280
everybody keeps saying that they want
more band with

39
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,360
games this time actually pulled through
sorta

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,299
and got a that in nineteen megabit
connection

41
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:03,400
to the Internet I'll explain why we
didn't have ninety making the connection

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,079
to the Internet even though we had it
later on

43
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:10,019
go some problems but yeah high-speed
internet access is something that

44
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,180
everybody always wants

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,260
communicating between the second floor
mats make mention space

46
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,160
ans the 1840s was because space is offer
a couple services number one

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,180
so everybody here gets the Internet we
have

48
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,989
typically our internet lines were wired
mines and

49
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,019
we can only get the wireline second
floor so that's how we were getting the

50
00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:33,230
down to %uh the second floor and on

51
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,070
also for the audio/video streaming where
awesome the people

52
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,108
we had overflow on the second floor

53
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:44,970
and the 18 handles the streaming

54
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:51,970
okay

55
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,140
here yeah

56
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,250
admonished them I'm not bill expands

57
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,280
mister anyway so we have job we have a V

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,730
requirements where restrain the talks
and presentations down to the second

59
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,319
floor

60
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:08,440
and right

61
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:15,109
let's see we also have the wireless

62
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:18,220
about yep side

63
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,280
a little nervous we have the public
terminals for attendees and we have to

64
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,870
protect itself that's where

65
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,660
we don't want the general wireless
network and what not to interfere with

66
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:27,940
the

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,990
speakers using the hard lines wired the
tables up here

68
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,590
we don't want to interfere with the
streaming network which simulcasts the

69
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,750
talks from appear

70
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,910
down to the second floor and other
management the land which controls the

71
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,680
switches and one on the different floors

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,830
and are typically the attire network is

73
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:48,050
of bildt's constructed hands everything
is

74
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,210
on donation effort so all the switches
so

75
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:54,349
weren't paid for the cabling actually
the signs for some

76
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,790
actually paid for pfeiffer to at its UK
together fighting Bernie s broad like

77
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,790
six polls

78
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:04,080
calf cable sign actually got no
donations

79
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,570
except I'd except for Asus was
impossible that i right

80
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:12,940
and assets right now hot me to a website
PTC actually got to

81
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,160
its to schools and then the actual right
now to get someone

82
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,050
nor Home Depot to get some more to get
some more cat-5 cable

83
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,250
so get typically the network is so

84
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,140
up 100 cents volunteer effort so

85
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,349
I'm sorry I'm sorry laptop I could just
like that this thing online

86
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,860
hers having issues and thus great
showing for the network staff here

87
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,580
thank you alright so

88
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,789
me out there's unfortunate scott there's
a

89
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,479
both baby team is an on here that
they're not really in that ballpark

90
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,880
never had a semi sites out on the TV
have

91
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,900
to get the internet up and running we
have something in pyro

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,660
who we found of the wiki anti volunteers
to although

93
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,490
the enormous effort to our I all the
negotiation with get

94
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,169
in getting out a company called Rainbow
broadband to

95
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,620
get us walk our our

96
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,150
broadband wireless access is over their
stand up and wave waif

97
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:21,150
da basically

98
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:25,099
I was very impressed that a that
accompany was you know

99
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:28,539
freely up really took a strong interest
in

100
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:33,010
out 2600 and no they wanted us to
showcase their

101
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,090
activity for by

102
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,300
giving us the axe band with the
conference on

103
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,970
and our now broadband vamo broadband
gave us the actual

104
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,470
microwave to our internet provider who
is i net access corporation

105
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:52,340
knocked out net and suddenly they give
us the DSL

106
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,940
6 make the DSL line which was basically
our fallback in case the %ah

107
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,180
rainbow or rather be migrating didn't
work out

108
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,610
but also not not give us the

109
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,659
IP space games the with you go see them
in action

110
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,870
especially Alex that knack has been
instrumental

111
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,880
in networking for several these
occasions he's very much

112
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,770
then responsible for when connectivity
wholesale so

113
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:23,770
love lot of props to an act and to Alex
on now I don't know if I

114
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,979
anybody from a Bose here pyro okay they
could be here so

115
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,750
but what's the guys name from right job

116
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,979
we had market Alex another Alex from
Rainbow broadband to

117
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,010
you got a sore great pipe and
unfortunately I have to take the credit

118
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,409
in on in the fact that me could utilize
the the

119
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:52,860
of the broadband access because of a bad
cable salts mean that a little bit later

120
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,210
on

121
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,520
are try to that seen it was gonna time
routing I

122
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,440
Jack I said of the corporate network was
basically

123
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,770
a part of town and I are all the cabling
was pretty much managed by

124
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:09,500
altruism pyro other PTC sup pretty much
stopped Mike and Mike

125
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,650
and knock was you know basically

126
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,500
run manned by everyone on the months on
the table

127
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,889
on the side so so now the

128
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,110
the fun part the planning job there was
an all planning

129
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,250
because you know a lot of stuff

130
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,280
real lives and you're trying to fit in
the plan for the conference a lot and

131
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,030
confidence

132
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,439
plan to the conference to stop was very
difficult sands plane

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,890
I was free somebody else was a free when
that person sry I was a free

134
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,000
so is just so it is very difficult
actually forty even at the

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,339
the known times were nation which were
the 2600 meetings and

136
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,480
the Andy hope meetings which were the
third Fridays

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,120
at the Civic Center so I did actually
get started

138
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,850
much the planning until about two weeks
ago I lot of

139
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,880
all the concepts at the same here for
the past couple years so it was like

140
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,689
got fine into this blind but you it

141
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,480
with a if I had more time medically we
could nail down a lot he saw

142
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,870
other problems on party

143
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,550
up on things we did plan on which was
I'm pp sites

144
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:22,819
I was using latex your routing because I
in the past are their hours were

145
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:26,969
obvious debased NHK it was a OpenBSD and
Andy

146
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,459
next accomplices were NetBSD and why
because

147
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:33,699
I was heavily involved in and I you know
obviously very

148
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:37,349
fluently handsets knows easy for me and
it's the other people who were involved

149
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,640
in it at the time

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,410
aid to use NetBSD to use up the issue be
stopping systems

151
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:45,459
but since this stuff the conference is
out because my personal life and

152
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,750
everything was going on was a chance I
was too. guess heavily involved in this

153
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,240
so I decided to switch to using clinics
because there are more people

154
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,680
who New Lenox that were involved in the
networking so

155
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,410
that's why would such as usual into a
Linux router I love you styled

156
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,790
a Cisco switches games Aruba wireless
access points

157
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,980
the I'll be get a five yr link between
the

158
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,860
to the eighteen floors mom we had
actually are

159
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,720
we measured the resistance and of course
the actual came up short saltzman about

160
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,220
that problem in a little bit

161
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,089
on again we are you talk about the back
to your cell on the label broadband

162
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,310
games we were gonna do some monitoring
using I just make sure that you know

163
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,670
certain

164
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,959
my sister disappear but its beer if we
ran outta time

165
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,959
and yeah but we do have some MRT grass
which are now completely skewed because

166
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:37,680
of a

167
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,780
you know the other problems we're having
and on

168
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,310
to Knox left just stop completely fell
apart it was out

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,930
you basically just a the poor people
were involved

170
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,709
and networking basically stayed most
time during the conference and of

171
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:55,500
BB lost track or volunteer so we
couldn't really you know have the box

172
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,380
not as well steps we wanted to so

173
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,750
so overall that was the plan could have
been a little bit better but by the end

174
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,390
results

175
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,600
you know these that we still had a
pretty decent network

176
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,390
one of the better net but probably best
network we've had yet and every

177
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:14,280
kinda got the conference the never seems
to get better so

178
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,230
be way to set up happened who started it
11 a.m. Thursday

179
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,680
up I don't think we're actually finished
setting up the network at

180
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,990
see on so yeah service be set up tables
at

181
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,980
just about 11 a.m. a getting the router
setup

182
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,510
make sure that was functional then we
decides to run the five yr

183
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,120
and we found that were about bombs to
educate short if we actually need

184
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,110
on so actually had to move the NOC over
with the fiber ended

185
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,440
and or and more specifically we use we
had to use another patch

186
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,860
and our fiber coupled with a for the
past

187
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,470
coupler that happens how from last
conference

188
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,790
games he moved to knock over to X where
the

189
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,380
miss so that that finished by August 9

190
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,680
camps

191
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,670
that it was about ninety I think we
started moving the knock around 9 p.m.

192
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,550
yeah it was too late to buy more fiber

193
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,740
right exactly so after depth the fiber

194
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,140
actually run on he said switches getting
all the lands going for

195
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,199
to June 18 then drive R&B gone

196
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:23,230
setting doing the AP set up getting them
deployed

197
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,459
cable than on the network much was done
with that by two guys

198
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:31,620
that you're done about 4 p.m. 4 a.m.
around

199
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,579
ends at 4 a.m. a we started working on
the firewall and getting policy routing

200
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,130
and I'll swing in a bit why we needs to
policy

201
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,260
on this is %uh example forty people

202
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,890
asking like you know are you UN's well
yes we were using the lands

203
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,540
om we have miss the US for

204
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,079
for each individual specific purpose
like the the truck the trial to our

205
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,579
in a provider was you know on its own
the land

206
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:02,600
are opting to the S l's on its own are
specifically because we have how we're

207
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,760
doing a routing

208
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,209
are wired access a few plugins and you
can attack downstairs

209
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,980
you you get you beyond the specific the
land

210
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,490
PTC eyes were on their own the land all
the streaming stuff which one to

211
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,439
separate from

212
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:18,610
the rest the network to protect its
that's on its own the land

213
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,209
over wireless access was

214
00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:26,309
separate network 30 bob Bennett external
the land for projects like

215
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:29,699
somebody want to set up a show people
how to setup torso

216
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:33,970
we gave him switching action so we can
set up his equipment

217
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,270
and %uh CTF which I we didn't happen it
was also on this range

218
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,270
on the speakers like the jackets

219
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:44,500
that killed twenty on the side every
cable thats on some feelings want that

220
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,100
again

221
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,510
want to protect its and then the appeal
and that managed everything

222
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,760
was was so

223
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,520
now arms of the routing in the past

224
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,280
this router was suffering is officially
a forty points for that matter to

225
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,179
lot around yes has been from the past
again we use Linux

226
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:09,170
for upcycle it's the router with

227
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,490
that that 6 17-6 for the colonel

228
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,679
mom the yes you quiet

229
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,459
to the cards that was handling all the
up links to

230
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:23,709
the sorry disorder plans we don't want
to use of

231
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,250
you know and talking so just more
processing was is easy just

232
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,939
just rerouting the side tables for the
firewall to protect networks

233
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:37,500
hands again abused child the next
province routing for the policy

234
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,160
leave a but sent

235
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,540
first Cheriton pop that

236
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,240
alright so Jessica

237
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,420
right so I see over here iight the

238
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,949
top right we have the radio broadband
connections and the bottom

239
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:58,860
Bob I'm sorry the top left we have the
unity

240
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,670
net access corporate is outside %ah VDSL

241
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,870
and what we did was we want me routed of
the wireless access

242
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,329
out the way before them to switch it up
balkan a majority are used to be.

243
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:15,049
wireless users handjob get them in our
users would be

244
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,480
you know wired you know %uh the pattern
of foster care of you needed an Ethernet

245
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,449
jack

246
00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:23,500
with it of that would be a lot less
traffic so he said that the DSL

247
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,770
want to make sure that we use both both
types of mother was wasted

248
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,429
and I'll so that's why we had to the
powerhouse writings because we had a

249
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:32,100
separate

250
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,179
yes last 22 us on that which is %uh by

251
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:38,380
basically of for classes on

252
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,910
that was for the wireless and got a size
24 just basically so classy

253
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,419
for the wired connection and that's what
the possible outcomes place I

254
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,520
if you were on what specific connection
iraqi at OnePath

255
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,390
on a diff actual to write about the
other path so

256
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,470
it was it's great in concept I do it at
home where I said oh my

257
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,360
web stuff out my cable modem in my
regular-season Sandown audits of

258
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,069
cause I DSL on so it's it's a it's good
concept but

259
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:09,260
the implementation of justice was a
nightmare probably took us a good about

260
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,919
three hours to

261
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:14,079
get it get that part actually while
working properly of course we also

262
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,620
started at 5am that probably didn't know

263
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,929
accelerate our mental processes there a
quick sorry guys if for

264
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,720
if there's somebody else who might have
a laptop with wireless an SSH on it but

265
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,900
I could borrow for a few minutes

266
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,579
got quite a crowd here is there's no
wifi working here

267
00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:35,910
your is there any networking here it
also shows owner

268
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,250
his wife over there on if anybody has
the ability to go online even through a

269
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,299
cell network and

270
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:46,240
greatly improve the quality the
presentation

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,459
I left their use

272
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:53,089
see thanks sex

273
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:56,270
alright so this the network topology

274
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,640
a see or hear job the right hand side

275
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,230
me about about but left inside the
second floor that's where the main

276
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,160
router was

277
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,829
meeting for missile where we have a
switch that connects the AP's and also

278
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,409
I connects to the remote province of on
those dishes are actually on the roof

279
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,049
and we have a

280
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:18,629
he's not going to the switch and
actually are out so it's you

281
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,000
a switch four-time the that radio
antenna you can actually see behind

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,980
that would be when you don't talk to the
radio antenna that's obvious the biggest

283
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,890
radio tell you look outside the window

284
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,410
that's where re: is going and so that's
four times square so the switch their

285
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,059
that

286
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,440
has a fiber connection down to 60 Hudson
Street for sale by the telco

287
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,559
tells and so that's where we connect to
our eyes peeled net access corporation

288
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:45,330
and and that's based that's yeah
basically

289
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,418
but I never deposit box but looks like
on to go back to

290
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:52,570
while it's just skipped over and the
dragon talk for a few minutes

291
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,409
to our list this year two years ago we
use some custom bill hardware which was

292
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,900
basically prime star satellite cabling
boxes with

293
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:05,440
a small motherboard shoved in a min
couple fans watched in there are a lot

294
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,530
of duct tape and

295
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:11,049
a hot melt glue on a prayer this year we
actually used to prove a T-seventy AP's

296
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:12,070
they donated

297
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,189
twenty of them to to the wireless here

298
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,210
arm there two hundred and some odd
megahertz mix boxes with Julie BG radios

299
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,620
with Power over Ethernet made it much
easier to set things up %uh the

300
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,360
Management Co this year was

301
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360
plugin for the new version kismet which

302
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,480
just lets you manage the radio is over
the standard protocol so I didn't have

303
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,470
to write nearly as much software

304
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,940
I'll we targeted three the G channels
and 3a channels per area

305
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,500
%ah 11 a is good up hopefully people
used it it seems like we got a fair

306
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,790
amount of usage on it

307
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,760
up 11 GE will to great itself to live in
the mode the instance someone with a

308
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,980
the only radio connects to it so thats
was pretty much guaranteed to be 11 make

309
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,350
a bit only

310
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,010
a we saw some DoS attacks against the
network but it wasn't as severe as it

311
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,020
was two years ago

312
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,668
so in general we held up a bit better
%ah every year we

313
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:07,559
tweak where we put the AP's little bit a
this year was mostly pretty good until

314
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:09,350
apparently right now but

315
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,730
I'm appear so I don't know what's going
on

316
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,510
and that was about it for the wireless
access

317
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:24,510
any outside I got about three minutes

318
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,910
see if there's anything else about the
network and I think that

319
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,210
too much covered out the parking lot

320
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,250
as we get to talk about some fuss was
about soured

321
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,840
talk those

322
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,000
alright I'll PTC go last a

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,710
so some the problems we had as the five
school ran out as we said

324
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,220
on now his raft on up

325
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:55,289
so we have this great ninety megabit
connection to the Internet and

326
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:58,140
when we were troubleshooting the problem
so that one of the link light on the

327
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,100
switch was

328
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,650
amber me was 10 megabits ends I'll also
notice that no matter what we did on the

329
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,770
wires were cut down

330
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,418
a are MRTG graphs showing that was only
about to make it

331
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:11,429
and I guess so that didn't actually I
didn't come into my mind

332
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:14,610
but all my might to troubleshoot i trace
it I thought it was going to go to the

333
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,490
AP's

334
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,020
turned out that this bad patch was what
was riding my wireless Internet access

335
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,850
so arm we can only get about 10 megabits
per second

336
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:27,570
not only that but I one can I'm we
couldn't even

337
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,450
max out for a single session for some
reason of have whenever you can created

338
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,220
a session on

339
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,539
it was about about 50k per second so

340
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,840
you if all the signs pointed to the ISP

341
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,149
that you thought that their jobs are the
Ice King act

342
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,150
om we thought they were doing some sort
traffic shaping maybe they gave us IP

343
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:46,900
addresses from

344
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,510
some other customer at some point I was
shaped

345
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:54,220
so I apologize net access corporation
into rainbow that you know

346
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,390
sped past separated us from Phil
utilizing the network but

347
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,430
right now if you get wireless access we
were downloading at

348
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,410
over some magic a per second which ISSS
we ever download it here

349
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,280
that whole conference so arm other
problems possibly adding one x was just

350
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,090
%uh

351
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,459
extremely complicated apparently to let
me go back to the network map

352
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,810
so if you see over here I am were

353
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:24,750
so for the the on this list we have to
I'm

354
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,210
the wired access the wireless access and
external

355
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,380
and those are the wireless and the is
what was 17 and see wired

356
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,490
hands the external we're on the same
size 24 be carved up

357
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,500
you know of we submitted it further

358
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,130
ans for each piece %uh these subnets

359
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,030
I when you don't pass a running you have
to you about basically nail down a route

360
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,540
for every single one of these

361
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,310
so tight he I the Sun PST what I've done
in the past was a set

362
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,600
if I you know I if it's going from one
IP address

363
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,500
routed to this idea to this kit waves
coming from different on

364
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,550
stuff IP address private to this other
gateway and that's really

365
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,350
about it literally three lines of a to
Ikea

366
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,630
guess what I you see get Posada NetBSD

367
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,590
here at the possum out was about 12
lines and it took us about

368
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,770
a couple hours to to get that working so

369
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:20,180
arm basically we had to split the
routing table for two different tables

370
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,280
one for each side

371
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:26,290
and we forgot at all the other interface
routes back into it

372
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,780
so which ourselves in the foot yeah

373
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,270
and the other way we shot ourselves in
the foot is that once

374
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,379
you know me fix the member broadband
problem the router

375
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,450
can barely keep up was falling over
itself so

376
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,600
next time he did you get the superfast a

377
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,590
wireless broadband I we'll have to get a
super-fast good Cisco switch

378
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:50,870
siskel out it's actually handle proper
outing get the error actually fell over

379
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,620
from PCI interrupt

380
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,960
at one point we broke a hundred thousand
interrupts a second and

381
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,940
it it didn't like it

382
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,640
so some the other problems I'll you
again volunteers despairing

383
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,740
jobs we had a a lot of people come up to
us beginning and say

384
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,030
up you wanna be never volunteers and sis
before we even had a network so we

385
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:13,720
didn't are

386
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,740
even have a place to have set up a
network so we did neither my tents and

387
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,990
I think after those people joined the
security team which is you know what

388
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,220
happens after all the time

389
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:25,330
and I'm but the people that we did have
that did

390
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,659
express interest and doing schools
leaving knock

391
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,610
I don't have actually got anybody from
the got that email the volunteer list

392
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,370
and said everyone if they want to
volunteer

393
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:37,570
how that we actually got any out boxed
up sorry got one person now this guy

394
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,860
named Andrew from Cisco

395
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,200
I for using modems routers as part of
the the core network

396
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,650
and but I was about it so the networkers
the NOC was pretty much just asked by

397
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,420
ops by the court ever team are the AB
team

398
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,910
and some other a project we have try to
get some webcams up to stream

399
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:58,830
to you know the up to the internet but
on that then really pan out but while

400
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,290
setting up they work pretty much
amending the knocks out

401
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,409
I we barely had just enough coverage see
you out make sure that

402
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,720
things a walk away whatever or people on
tamper with the network

403
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,929
so mom guess they write some lessons so

404
00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:14,170
so lessons over this experience was

405
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:17,630
which I I think I probably said this at
the last hope was

406
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,179
it was actually a review what we talked
about the problems that we had

407
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,540
from last of we didn't I don't think by
different doing that

408
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,350
on which also try to do again the
capital planning which I didn't really

409
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,809
get a chance to do much of

410
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,370
I could have been better at fighting
specific details the network to the

411
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:36,250
people who want to do stuff network

412
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,500
more specifically you know I'm even even
then I'd really didn't get any details

413
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,950
of what people need it from the network

414
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,580
until the day the network was set up for
the day before that works out

415
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,580
arm everybody's heard the term

416
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,580
the the the phrase measure twice cut
once thats that's a

417
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,780
pretty important special when you run a
five yr on before it for just $50 fee

418
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,670
250 did not make it from the

419
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,020
from 84 to the second floor we actually
had to use a

420
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,170
couple like I mentioned before on again
coordinating specific times volunteers

421
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,220
on Get Smart is me to make sure that
they're

422
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,490
gonna be where they are date that we
realize that people want to see the

423
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,020
conference

424
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,389
but when you you know promise that you
know how about knocking then disappear

425
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,540
that makes you know

426
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,260
keeping the network up and running a
little bit difficult and slesinger

427
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,470
was a keeping making a separate project
knock where I like people want to

428
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,970
separate or router or

429
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,010
webcams or whatever to keep that somehow
not because I'm

430
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,910
you know people tripping over the cables
can you know take on the network and

431
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,040
you know two hands to his people away
while we're

432
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,889
know %ah China fix problems gets a
little frustrating time consuming and

433
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,750
you know please

434
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,900
yeah getting fix a problem so we
definitely need to separate out

435
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,429
stuff stuff from the NOC and I think
that's about it for my part

436
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:51,710
so do you for no

437
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:58,710
turn it over to ductile server to talk
I'll check

438
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:04,330
cable suing its summer net going on here
cuz mines

439
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,399
some with the pattern on that so what
else was a talk about is the public

440
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,630
terminal cluster if you guys have miss
this

441
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,220
this is a small collections smattering
really of

442
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,260
terminals are various types downstairs
just left the escalators you get off

443
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,850
going up

444
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:21,850
loves this is -6

445
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,590
whole I guess to be involved in some
manner was something like this

446
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:30,730
very first hope which was here in this
hotel there was an official terminal

447
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:35,480
service put on by the the con management

448
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,470
which I was not harder but we had our
own little party going on because they

449
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:38,990
allowed

450
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:42,169
anyone to set up what they wanted so I
run a few people on a few

451
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:46,090
terminals various types but after that
we produce we are not gonna

452
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:49,460
we were able to get on I so hope to
conduct com

453
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,720
get to and so I've heard a few documents
from

454
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,230
the earlier times um so

455
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,480
some people feel that the public from a
cluster should provide a service an ass

456
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,270
services access to the Internet

457
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,059
well that of course is just plain stupid
because this is a hacker conference

458
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:07,730
people

459
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,000
they want on-line for your laptop's so
the

460
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,550
rendition that I've take that too sorry
has been

461
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,980
more or less to do something cool Korea

462
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,750
panacea or so didn't think clear that
those temps to

463
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,570
um so we've been trying to do some cool
last year actually

464
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:30,918
from there are two of us who have been
the main instigators

465
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,169
myself and again and Mike with the Y and
Mikey

466
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,419
who was pretty much in charge %uh
everything last year

467
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:42,050
and he was much more on the side I will
try and provide a service his

468
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:47,540
a system no traditional arts last year
he focused mainly on providing winik's

469
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,700
accessed through my Xboxes i think is a

470
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,260
core machine as a three hundred
megahertz pentium

471
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,870
but im program to with the 6420 makes a
ram

472
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,919
group C Drive forget that is that so
they work very well

473
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,980
so the year before we had two things he
had his life thing that I had

474
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,320
started the first year with though that
was my first year with headless

475
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,270
rather so I just less terminals we're
used to in see dealer called in CT

476
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,860
explorer.exe a zoo

477
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:23,400
little black boxes little smaller than a
laptop that have

478
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,650
ps2 output VGA output and network

479
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,030
input/output and have noticed him just
as much a ram and they require some sort

480
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,970
machine that we offer to get there from
where and when to run

481
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:38,770
and I was very cool from the thing is
very cool last year was

482
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,990
the existence of token ring the entire
network was not even a

483
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,630
it was talking it was just a pair took a
ring and that made a particularly

484
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,290
interesting

485
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,629
for people we always have this from
putting their own laptops into the

486
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:54,720
switches and trying to get around stuff
was pretty fun washing plugin

487
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,720
trying to figure out how to get online
for the talking router most people

488
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,260
didn't know what opening was so

489
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:04,450
we got our little private class of other
a we had a similar thing for this year

490
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,220
as the previous your biggest problem
with providing this know it set out

491
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,730
switches on the tables we had fifty the
one year two years two times ago we have

492
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,120
a hundred terminals 50 which time

493
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,429
and there was a massive mess my god
other people would put their own stuff

494
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:21,240
into the term into the switches

495
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,900
and pretty of the most you would would
signed the router address to their own

496
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,790
laptop

497
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,620
pretend that they're you know the main
router gateway for everything and you

498
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,650
could guess what happens then also to
conflict you're getting upset

499
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,760
us thank god you're a loser was really
nice so

500
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,800
last year that was dealt with by having
token ring on the network

501
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,169
since I was doing it since I was going
on site this year and I'm wouldn't have

502
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:44,169
token ring is an option for the

503
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,220
terminals that I want to use this year
it is a little different

504
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,850
we did use Ethernet I guess we wanted to
we could have had it somewhat secure you

505
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,210
know assign a Mac at his performance
only way to get around that

506
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,540
instead this year we decided not to use
TCP IP as I never protocol

507
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,168
but instead shows definite to use our
network protocol

508
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:07,490
so people who were put into our network
and themselves very cool

509
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:11,050
I'm playing as the workers by myself the
gateway address and it's up there and

510
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,480
nothing would happen because we're using
TCP IP

511
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,840
so we got around that using Dec that
this year was a lot of fun

512
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,270
and also to provide extra charge for
those who are interested in it

513
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,740
instead of using Linux as our operating
system

514
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,020
or using Windows or using BST or Unix
period

515
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,550
we chose to use VNS as the operating
system for Central terminal's

516
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,190
percent remain for him solve our
terminals terminals ran

517
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,760
and gave you a VM ass to the college DCL
sessions so they go into the terminal

518
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:45,270
and we've saw several people try to hack
route on this

519
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:48,490
people who are for the mass know there's
no actual name the cow

520
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:51,880
her account name to root its system by
the way

521
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,960
we could have a whole session on how not
to have proven to be an icebox

522
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,380
just by watching these guys try this it
was a lot of fun

523
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,320
but you know we did provide web service
we provide as a safe seat on access all

524
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
the services you need

525
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,120
it tight that it worked if he even if
you type in capitals you know that's the

526
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,309
cool thing about the MS

527
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:12,690
case insensitivity why are these new
kids I forgot about that one needs to be

528
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:15,380
able to typecast and get away with it

529
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,380
so some other things we have here my
calling is my

530
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,669
the guy who has done a lot of this
before and he's done some excellent

531
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:23,120
stuff

532
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,200
what browsers Firefox K

533
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,200
there's a says way to increase the font
size right

534
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,750
I know that 6

535
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:44,050
alright socio left-center okay cool so
out of gas and see this or not

536
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,990
area the choice of today

540
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:03,990
a alone travel

541
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,870
alright anyway this is from I believe
this is from two years ago 2002 that was

542
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,620
two-time 0

543
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,790
on how you define a for increased

544
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,230
the same thing just let you guys know
I've been using Firefox

545
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,659
for about six years I think now and last
month

546
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:28,909
switched opera

547
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:32,960
her look it's not open source is a is up
for open source

548
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,840
and your client the hell is better and I

549
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,679
due to an opera seems to have come back
I used to love opera

550
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:43,800
and didn't just to keep up to date now
firefights now

551
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,889
uppers back to their call this is what
everyone I O no problems

552
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:50,899
tell us if I can find my

553
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:54,240
the favorite part is that I like
families with their toys are from

554
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,380
a by the way guys will have some stuff
to go way down stairs most murders

555
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,540
please don't take the time was himself
they're available four hundred dollars

556
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,639
apiece but I can't give away this year

557
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:08,149
they belong to someone else a see where
the heck is a

558
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:12,060
my yard points toughly days to take a
love that scoring are points that time

559
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,730
this is very important to us

560
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,030
more than providing a service more than
doing so so they are art

561
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,240
are questioning it the image of Derek
you finna some I ben in cyber techno

562
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,990
ghetto is priceless

563
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,940
literally shoot for that this year and
in early make it but

564
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:30,630
yeah some girl games not there were 13
back down here one of the principals

565
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,429
consume some nasty looking for a model
in a bag

566
00:33:33,429 --> 00:33:36,149
you know when I want to happen this year
but were soon for next time were a

567
00:33:36,149 --> 00:33:37,889
little more things we really

568
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:41,040
this is the year we had a hundred
terminals and it was way too much so

569
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,899
much stuff

570
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:45,700
all over the place is and Muscat it
comes to computers

571
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,060
too much crap ever last year lease we
settled on earth kind of 36 we did 36

572
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,908
again this year and that's a pretty good

573
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:56,450
number so look at tonight's really
didn't have as much usage a

574
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,820
this year as we have in past years I
think more laptops is

575
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,520
what that's due to my thing me for next
year gonna try something else

576
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,760
who are point above suggestions on what
to try out

577
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,190
as far as the whatever BeOS well thats
unit right

578
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,970
so an overdue without ever with a rugby
OS

579
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:18,839
some uptick in on her to pick you know
if someone isn't there

580
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,929
%uh microcontrollers

581
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,339
yes I'm wouldn't do it

582
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:28,489
I was when we went to the dejected both

583
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:33,520
posters yeah I'm any %uh any good ideas
online here

584
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,168
so this is our schedule that we had
planned for Ridgeway I essence Mike

585
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:40,418
was able to make it we Christian this
caused to these

586
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:43,668
michael Hart Memorial all internal
cluster

587
00:34:43,668 --> 00:34:48,279
and this is our originals a schedule
unlikely we didn't really

588
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,010
stick to the schedule this year what I'm
I am very happy to report

589
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,370
but we do have a lot of fun um

590
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:01,060
so what see it's been six times with
john also two different technology

591
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,299
yes so I'm definitely pushing something
I have been financing this

592
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,810
the last six times I'm gonna push for
more are the service

593
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,700
for the next time

594
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,140
that's a constraints on the other things
we had here

595
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,410
effect adjusters

596
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:22,960
is a vehicles are

597
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,050
mascot is actually a mascot from last
time

598
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:30,060
as an actual person we had here at the
at the convention

599
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,810
and that's what look like it was there
in 10

600
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:41,089
actually don't know if we get these yeah
hopefully

601
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:44,950
and see things as they were before this
is a I use our sponsorship has changed a

602
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,299
bit over the years

603
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,200
and knees now we have Toro as a sponsor
does wireless internet

604
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,670
in various places

605
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:57,730
this is not gonna be wasn't so we might
just give up on the pictures here

606
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,770
yeah Yahoo hope to conduct com so

607
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:09,240
that's my nyse: my anti-spam system in a
cool way to create a website replaces

608
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm yes so the throw to have a PDC

609
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,160

610
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,799
have questions because of you know we've
got about 45 minutes

611
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,800
for her mother but see if there's
anything useful

612
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,750
from about or the looks good for graph

613
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,050
yeah weaver we've had sort of sketchy

614
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,170
volunteers on last year's very wants to
volunteer now

615
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,630
for the one in two years we can use your
especially

616
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,650
we need a graphic designer big time so
so it is really good a graphic design

617
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,290
wants to help us out for the next
session are coming up after after the

618
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,440
things we need a graphic designer
big-time

619
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,569
alright so bio saying before we did get
MRTG

620
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:58,170
doing some graphing and to be a little
bit skewed because for

621
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,390
up until about an hour ago hi we were
pushing about to make a bit

622
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,460
and so that's all that this is drop the

623
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,880
up drop conference we are about to make
it and then

624
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,750
we fix the problem and that's this so

625
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,300
the grass on the record but this show
that we did

626
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,680
pretty much come close to full utilizing
our band with for

627
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,279
you know the pleasure spiral goddess the
internet connection

628
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,740
and at sea for our DSL look like

629
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,380
and we have pretty much a I'm not have
think that can't be right

630
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,740
how do we put out something to make a
bit may even over our DSL

631
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,890
that is alright actually I think that
was when I am

632
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,259
our okay that's not actually accurate I
was done i think im

633
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,680
pressing the wrong link on that one that
one is the link to our internal network

634
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,680
and its mislabeled receive

635
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,770
I think we would we would actually
trying to push out that much man with a

636
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,089
naked and I don't know why that by that
looks like that

637
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:05,650
but for the pretty much by until that
spike that had something to make that we

638
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,190
were

639
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,390
averaging about upstream three maybe but
a second South

640
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,560
had great graphs I guess maybe 10
there's a clean up the Rd files and I

641
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,029
you know but just take it up until about
4 p.m. maybe the

642
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,250
maybe look a little better I do have one
question the crowd actually one of the

643
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:23,380
things we had planned for this year and
didn't

644
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,350
and applying of were VGA and so the
monitors

645
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,529
DJ goggles so worst thing about that for
next year so I hands would

646
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,830
use the VGA goggles could attract them
to the mood

647
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,180
DJ goals what attracts you to the public
from a closer to use it

648
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,759
record worry about him either use the
goggles before and

649
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,400
over Alcoa okay exxon idea

650
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,950
guys are doing great already so VGA
goggles will be one of the things on the

651
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:52,800
on deck for next time

652
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,630
and I we have one more things my candy

653
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,069
to use is such to welcome to right so

654
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:05,240
upjohn the planet Ben to get the setup
on projectors but due to smile s

655
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,460
switch for some problems in there are
already being tanked WEA

656
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,319
we couldn't get to spend ports going and
I didn't want to run to speed up on a

657
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:12,430
router that was barely

658
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,589
working to begin with but a this shows a

659
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:19,190
r.i.p space the Internet IP space in the
port up

660
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,480
right after we are right before we took
the screenshot see someone port scan to

661
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,160
the entire const based probably on forty

662
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,190
and then I we also mapped all the
connections coming in and out and what

663
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:31,550
city they went to

664
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,120
sex I'm a- now with your planning which
I was able do lovable

665
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,130
I'll try to get somebody specifically
dedicated to

666
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,520
to individual getting the visualization
set up because I this is %uh a lot a

667
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,550
great work but unfortunately you know
nobody got to see it until now

668
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,560
and if you guys could see well enough
but I

669
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,839
yeah next time try to get that done both

670
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,170

copy his he never released this

673
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,650
obviously there is there really

674
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,290
funeral they are there's the program is
called the spinning cube a potential

675
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:10,850
doom

676
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:13,940
and he

677
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,049
yet spinning cube attention but I it was
written by our

678
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:20,069
what's new who works for the a

00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:24,610
you know try to figure out what was
