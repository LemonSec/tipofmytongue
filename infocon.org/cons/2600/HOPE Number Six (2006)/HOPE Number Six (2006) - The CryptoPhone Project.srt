1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,199
there also were a Glee Club CE

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,210
you're not not nice looking device but I

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,930
you know if it comes to security
personally I don't think that fashion

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,990
should be important in voice encryption
but and his

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,509
but at this sir it was when we when we
talk to the people who are caring for

6
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,800
I'll let's say head of the company was
indictment privacy

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,390
profile needs to protect us and needs to
protect us from called

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,749
arm one of two the things that we get to
hear from them as

9
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:34,230
okay to phone needs to be new and shiny
are

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,320
because even need to get this guy to

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,760
makers phone calls at least a few phone
calls secure then

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,899
does must be phone buddies Pro two short
was Paul's on-the-go Flynn

13
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:50,230
no and not some old at the six year old
thing needed he needs to hide in his

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,370
pocket and only

15
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,769
golden make his phone call on and secret
the

16
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:58,460
not be exposed to to the loss of a spot
so am

17
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,370
do being on on recent recently was this
was

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,730
was certainly 11 of 26 what you want to
do home

19
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:10,750
sir another problem usted are most of
the stuff that was in the market

20
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,000
when we when we started are didn't have
any if

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,260
for system integration meaning there was
no fluke nor system

22
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,130
except one which is to use government i
won your system

23
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,310
that could do mobile phone to a landline
to satellite

24
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,110
so which is a requirement lot of regions
of the world

25
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,370
and especially for for activists and
journalists and people who are

26
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,550
out there reporting stuff arm then Danny

27
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,399
danita for integrated solution does not
trust mobile to mobile or not just let

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,810
alone to lengthen and corruption

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,030
sorry the the phones the VIN

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,180
on the market and when we started arm in
short they're not really what we needed

31
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,360
sore okay so when

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,870
Robin myself started to look into this
which

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,400
yes maybe fifteen years ago we ran into
some problems

34
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,970
and the thing is the biggest problem
that we run into

35
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,889
us

36
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,250
CPU to compress the voice you would
think that

37
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,840
encrypting the voices CPU intensive but
it's actually not its compressing the

38
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,209
voice

39
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,780
and it took some while before we
actually had a platform

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,909
that we could do this on so

41
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:27,150
just for short explanations or home or

42
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,040
was inclusion really works today from
while ago

43
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,798
divers oK what's Graham Los where the
state of two articles

44
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,920
public you able what was basically
adding some noise to the voice or

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,500
dropping the voice up in loops little
chance

46
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,200
and realigning these transfer the sounds
like double

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,040
all these messages really dont stent are
up against her

48
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,439
modern processing power so that cannot
be regarded secure sorrry was in trypsin

49
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,510
works that way to to deter us to voice

50
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,739
compress it and then used to compression
results

51
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:04,739
arrest input for an encryption system
and then use the data channel to

52
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:05,959
transport a digitized

53
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,500
encrypt compressed was to the other side
and a reverse the process

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,900
so meaning the what you reduce doing

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,699
data transmission with encrypt it
compressed was trunks

56
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:20,549
inside so we need a lot of CPU for
instance for

57
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,900
especially for the full for was
compression so when we thought about

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,620
this

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,319
we knew for sure that it was not going
to be an analog scrambler because

60
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,909
analog voice encryption cannot be secure

61
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:35,410
if you listen to analog

62
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,480
Voice critters and you remain silent you
say nothing into the

63
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,349
devices most of the time you will hear
nothing you'll

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,720
and when you start talking you know you
will start hearing noise so

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,190
if you can already detect when somebody
stalking and when it's island you know

66
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,650
you can figure out with some

67
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,250
the species in with some processing
power you can always turn it back

68
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:56,680
because

69
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,099
human voice really can be predicted
pretty well

70
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,000
a but you know the slides called goals
so the

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,519
the thing that we had in mind was to
provide something dress wordy

72
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,540
that people can really see for
themselves that

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,609
at least we did as good a job as
possible in making think secure

74
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,350
meaning no back doors we had to publish

75
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,669
source code this was the first thing
that you know we

76
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,159
we discussed we should whatever we do we
have to publish two sources

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,000
you know only way that you can at least
get some confidence from your customers

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,220
that you doing the right thing

79
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,160
there some disadvantage to publishing
the source

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,330
that we will get into later another
thing that we really wanted to do is not

81
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,039
to have

82
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,310
BK I infrastructures and basically to
design goal

83
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,590
of the phone was to keep it as simple as
possible for the user

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,099
no selections for encryption algorithms

85
00:04:56,099 --> 00:05:00,419
you know how do you should know if they
should use idea or tripled this or

86
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,900
single dinosaur really you know you
should consider

87
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,950
user is dumb as possible with all
respect for the user

88
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,580
but you know redesigned thing we make it
a strong as possible

89
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,760
and no options for the user to set to
screw things up

90
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,370
and messed things up commercially
available

91
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,060
meaning that everybody must be able to
buy these phones evens people

92
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,960
I maybe don't like you know it should be

93
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,200
crypto for everybody wanted

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,760
and we also decided that seems our phone

95
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,120
is basically a piece of software we
might as well give

96
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,169
out a free program for Windows PCs that
will turn your PC or laptop

97
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,859
into a secure phone and that you can
actually use what we have

98
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,370
written and that's what we did we Road
Small PC client

99
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,360
that people can just run for free on
them she is not Voice over IP it only

100
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,400
works with modems

101
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,360
so to people two persons gotta have a
modem and a PC

102
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,990
to be able to communicate with each
other but then they can use the full

103
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,130
unblock version of crib the phone and

104
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,110
another advantage that this has is if
somebody already secured before

105
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,430
owner and you know they need to make an
urgent call

106
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,890
and they can't wait for the other party
to also buy a crib the phone they can

107
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,780
say well you know

108
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,080
he's a few steps to go to that website
download the program

109
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,570
you-know-who the modem up to your phone
line and I will give you a call their

110
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,680
a.m. this was the design goal for

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,110
forget the phone part of the reasoning
for doing the free PC client is

112
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,780
arm what you're basically from from a
community

113
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,680
around it is very close to the casino
and are it has always wanted to support

114
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,190
political activists and

115
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,270
we realized it from there are the mobile
phones will not be cheap

116
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,219
so we we come into that later but no
divall not be cheap enough

117
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:59,289
for every human rights activists to get
one so we want

118
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,120
to have from the beginning a method for
all those people who really needed to

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,849
get it for free

120
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:08,630
so and so that's that's why we decided
to stay BB always to free PC client

121
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,330
and it will always be free PC clone for
future product so this this is one of

122
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,200
two things to

123
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,599
are the two companies based on so giving
big stuff to the community and

124
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,370
enabling people to are to have secure
communication without paying

125
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,669
thing look for it so 'em so

126
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:28,690
ASM may have guessed financially the
company works we're selling the mobile

127
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,330
phones

128
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,180
and be giving the PC client for free so
people who have money you need mobile

129
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,719
phones

130
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:37,919
can but a mobile phones people who don't
have money just get a PC for dude

131
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,760
free PC client approx 30 um

132
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,760
sore publishing the source code

133
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,360
Asbury said was one of two the key
objectives to

134
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,580
some to gets trust into this

135
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,068
this will business no we actually have
customers a very for the source court

136
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:01,710
love them do not the some of them do

137
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,889
we had la to customers who heard it was
seems to look into the source code look

138
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:06,560
for

139
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,860
especially for back towards love too
good to refuse really strong as we claim

140
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,750
and every one of them so far has been
has been very well satisfied

141
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,650
the back side is of course that
competitors also looking to restore

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,900
Scotland sometimes all good steel

143
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,160
sore still to be had one case in in
Europe where a German company actually

144
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,630
are based their product on source called
that they stole from us

145
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,990
arm sore of course our engineers

146
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:35,640
know how to look into other people's
binary which was not difficult because

147
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,169
even that the synchronization tones when
these phones connect they have a

148
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,478
synchronization tone

149
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,010
they even stole the synchronization tone
so it there was occluded

150
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,250
you know these people might have looked
into our code a little

151
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,699
too well but I mean you know having
another product

152
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:56,359
and and testing their the beta version
and hearing your synchronization tones

153
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,390
when they exchange secure key is like

154
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:04,180
happened if we do something wrong a
sorry this is amazing

155
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,500
the stone has their distant only name
after

156
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,699
sound of penguins meeting and to

157
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:15,120
if basically your has been returning as
one of our guys singing into a

158
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,130
microphone 10

159
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,180
playing along with two was some problems
on Flickr

160
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:22,819
chief to to result if you want to those
really or

161
00:09:22,819 --> 00:09:27,569
no or sound and so then we looked into
into the binary info know that the

162
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:31,040
hat hadn't even bothered to the

163
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,180
to read rewrote the stuff but copy paste
sauce could from on assorted

164
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,670
we figure out how to replicate the
compiler settings so that we could

165
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,680
so did we compiling also scored was
there a compiler settings and opened a

166
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,780
binary

167
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,199
sword that was pretty stupid arm Indian

168
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:54,709
they went bankrupt because or we rated
their place two days before they wanted

169
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,000
to sign a major

170
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,270
are went a couple the capital agreement
which didn't sit too well as to venture

171
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:00,980
capitalist

172
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,480
and sore home that it was them then

173
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,589
suits and kind of Unreal strip approach

174
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,680
home but we have noticed before that

175
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,360
at approximately so the the the power
source code does not repeal

176
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,880
it's not or another and you have to know
licenses but it's a special

177
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,180
specialize in success a key contributor
source code you can look into the source

178
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,600
code can analyze it as long as he won

179
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,360
but you cannot do anything else with
that from

180
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,600
mean you cannot not busy on products on
them and so on so on solar

181
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,670
thats basically the trade-off between

182
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,620
needs to publish the source code and
give everybody the known

183
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,280
the possibility to look for a victorious
and on the on the other hand protecting

184
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,720
the business interests so that we can
offer commercial with company

185
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,850
sore term

186
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,199
okie the system what he was he doing arm

187
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:56,370
we using Windows Mobile smartphones and
PDAs for the mobile site

188
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,689
are the reason that we use them as well
as the the moment to be started there

189
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:00,300
was

190
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,410
David all-new phones to hurt sufficiency
you porn only at Lisa to americans on

191
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,640
processing

192
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,860
which is not completely true dat was
also the Nokia stock slower

193
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,130
no closer to an immigrant the first

194
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,370
but the thing was that the Symbian
operating system

195
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,750
did not support streaming audio

196
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,939
so first the Nokia

197
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:29,939
ninety 200 that was a PDA phone that
would flip open with a keyboard

198
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:34,260
really nice phone but we couldn't get
enough support to get streaming audio

199
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,459
only to record and playback

200
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:40,180
and we never figured it out how we could
make streaming audio

201
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,780
and then I'm dad and the first phoned XD
a

202
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,390
came out and it was a %uh phone that ran

203
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,730
we know she actually and what was good
about minutiae

204
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,040
is that does a lot of source code
published on C

205
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,410
many people don't realize that but that
there is actually quite some

206
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,640
source code out of we know she and

207
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,270
that really enabled us to look deeper
into it and and

208
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:12,000
you know made us do whatever we had to
do to get this running

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,500
assorted major major aspect or which

210
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,100
also reveals differ a lot from from
copper to competition it has come up

211
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,579
over last year's

212
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,589
that you really caring for the phone
that you're running on so it's not just

213
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:26,990
a piece of software running on a generic
operating system

214
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,540
because the wouldn't get to secure it
even a small world of the books

215
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,329
business and fine but you need to do lot
of stuff to hardened against attack

216
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,699
so what you do is arm we have and when
did something difficult to security

217
00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:43,730
prefers prefer manager where we give to
use the comp a bit

218
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,839
do the possibility to

219
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:49,949
choose between functionality of the
operating system and security of the

220
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,170
operating system

221
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,630
believes in case I don't need internet
honestly wasn't if I don't need MS

222
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,600
Sandiford on the VBScript and all this
other crap

223
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,839
then you can just remove it very easy
very user-friendly issued

224
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,270
to security proffer selector from for

225
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,720
for standard of the cell phones we have
four different levels of security

226
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,280
between ordered security over dude just

227
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,020
some minor stuff to prevent outright use
a stupidity look installing

228
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,569
applications on that arm too extreme
security for nothing else but

229
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,900
her phone calls group sold in between we
have from

230
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,140
spectrum of removing stuff adding what
stocks

231
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,530
removing attack vectors 27 protocols
doing stuff like

232
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,030
disabling Bluetooth headset use during
crop to calls

233
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,540
because people vote really be so stupid
as using the Bluetooth headset to

234
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,819
broadcast their secure Core Contents our
own before

235
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:44,010
gets to encryption engine stuff like a
third

236
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,770
the the real remain problem in security
is preventing the user from doing stupid

237
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,910
things

238
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,219
so that's that's one after two main
problems that we face and user interface

239
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,600
design

240
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,610
them france's or a talk to our

241
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,939
to a guy no will work for the russian
own

242
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:04,990
and is a equivalent so busy with the
Russian signals intelligence people

243
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,260
is a dedicated damn the main source of
information that we had was

244
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,030
monitoring the lines but Americans had
securing trip to phones on

245
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,600
for the two trips was going on before
and after secure core

246
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,819
so basically people were lowell

247
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,459
Anthony noticed that this started drift
into classified areas they would switch

248
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:25,819
under

249
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:30,020
the the encryption and but what's going
on before and after was

250
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,380
interesting enough to justify money want
on-line store

251
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,939
are one of the things that we decided as
deferred absolutely no confusion at all

252
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:41,849
about whether you're in a secure mode or
not and you should not be able to set up

253
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,589
a secure

254
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:46,100
and secure content switch over to secure
more but you has to decide to make a

255
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,059
non-secure call

256
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:50,280
secure call so that for instance well
inland model

257
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:53,490
we have also led land phone as only
secure core mode

258
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,540
so there is no simply no option of doing
doing something stupid

259
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,969
so that's or it has some inconveniences
on the other side but we feel that

260
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,809
since since our phones are being used by
people who've really something to lose

261
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:10,549
are up to their lives are we should try
to prevent them from from being stupid

262
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:12,319
as much as possible

263
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:17,360
term parties to protest that are we are
not selling the softer

264
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,030
but we're selling pre-configured pre
flashed mobile phones

265
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:24,350
sordid that's really more or less like
to make it the experience meaning

266
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,730
on ripkin's autism play secure call so
that's that's

267
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,459
that was the goal arm and it also
enables us to do these things

268
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:34,600
operating system to make it to make a
secure am

269
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,130
and prevent prevent problems

270
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,579
on that later this is actually one thing
missing before

271
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,290
unwrap insert sim place call and it is

272
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,780
open seal and verified that the seal has
not been opened before

273
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:54,400
whenever we ship the phone we put it in
a secure container

274
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,100
with I security hologram seals on it is
have a serial number

275
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,970
before two phones leave the facility we
made high resolution

276
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,889
photos of the seals so if you receive
your crib the phone in a sealed box

277
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,329
you can send us an email saying you know
I received the phone

278
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:16,740
phones can you please send me the
pictures and then we can I do with PGP

279
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,510
signed

280
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,630
we can send you these pictures and you
can actually fare if I for yourself

281
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,769
that within the twenty-four hours that
it takes to transfer the phones from our

282
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,699
office to your place wherever you are

283
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:31,029
nobody has tampered with the box

284
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,120
and you know gave you a special update
on your phone that

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,529
you might not really want so and I think

286
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,839
were about the only company that does
that rights group Tim everybody else

287
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,250
on also if the government remains order
known

288
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,070
nothing to use government also German
government indecent or disperse the

289
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,560
government

290
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,190
phones to do something similar and a
half supra Korean at work for

291
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,860
for cryptographic systems which we
unfortunately don't have

292
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,709
but we do as much as we can to to
prevent tampering with the phones

293
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:05,120
Okies or

294
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,770
speaking about encryption arm what we do
is we do for 2006 but if you have a key

295
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,470
exchange

296
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,549
arm it takes a moment longer than

297
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,309
on most competing products because we
have four to six but which takes a while

298
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,619
to

299
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,449
transport over the 9.6 killer but armed
paper called that we used to transport

300
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:22,919
the

301
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,400
home the voice we using

302
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,559
on GSM 9.6 kilobits or issues D
circuit-switched later

303
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,840
so it's not you purists but sees the to
direct link between the two phones

304
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,939
mall is like a modem column to use them
um

305
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,010
so after the key exchange we we haz arm

306
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,960
the result into free difference of keys
using chalk 256

307
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,179
arm because the seems to be no other

308
00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:53,380
be sent her a gruesome still living

309
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,040
term if you notice the trip to design
even after some some collusion attack

310
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,070
happening too far to 56 in this design

311
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,090
in the future it doesn't break to
cripple

312
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,240
no it also doesn't make it more
predictable

313
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,860
a row so we the wheel designs set up in
a way that

314
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:13,250
things can go wrong for one of two
algorithms involved

315
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,390
so that's also overuse as: and

316
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,110
to fish sore no we think too for a
stronger than any s

317
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,740
most other people agree on that are a a
sister long distances

318
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,340
more customers are rumors very
well-researched and the people

319
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,490
no so the name is known which is good
for marketing and he wasn't marketed

320
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,820
the product term so we're on these

321
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,040
the to a group inkatha mort or X or
injuries are generating a key stream

322
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,720
exhorting the key stream to the

323
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,950
to the voice data arm sober this design
is also relatively CPU

324
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,049
frontally meaning onto a minute Cebu are

325
00:18:51,049 --> 00:18:56,010
optimized re seeing re on the regional
six to seven percent of CPU's only for

326
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,030
encryption process

327
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,480
and do weighted the that we invented

328
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,260
or for about descriptive scheme what we
had in mind that

329
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:08,770
we wanted to use the most secure biggest
length

330
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,290
keys on the market or or known

331
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,820
to to work and and their research
because

332
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,260
our philosophy is that if people make a
call

333
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,340
with the phone now it should remain a
secret for

334
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,520
as long as possible and we could have
gone for

335
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,429
2048 bit encryption right now everybody
thinks that's great but maybe in one

336
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:32,030
year or

337
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,549
how many years you know the lower key
links will probably always fall for so

338
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,110
we really had in mind that

339
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,830
we hope that calls will be secure for
10-15

340
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,889
20 you never can guess that but we
really did our best to

341
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,429
make sure that its as long as possible
and that if something breaks that we

342
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:53,090
don't need to redesign the phone

343
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,658
but that phone can still operate because
Nov a yes is broken into fish is not

344
00:19:57,659 --> 00:19:58,620
broken because

345
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,620
it works a little bit different
internally we hope

346
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,520
that type of thing so we really try to
harden

347
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,870
the crypto layer as hard as we could to
make

348
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,540
to calls last secure as long as possible
that was the basic

349
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:16,668
design goal was do having a durable sore

350
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,890
yesterday other criticisms are on data
using fantastically long killings

351
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,909
arm but were the key exchange took so
long to

352
00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:30,830
busy you can abuse anymore arm so design
is always a compromise we know but we

353
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,070
we try to are on the side of caution and
are makers on us as hard as possible

354
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,070
are number of crew to X experts have
looked and its

355
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:43,320
and are no one has fond fountain problem
so far on that

356
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,450
from you up to that supposed to cry to
resign

357
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,700
sorrel people who know but of book over
people notice that

358
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,960
term diffie-hellman of course has no are

359
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,149
authentication Bolden sore love you
human

360
00:20:59,149 --> 00:21:02,409
key exchange you need some hard to know
was the other side other was a good

361
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,100
woman in the middle attack by

362
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,140
using to crop the phone spectrum back
are building up a secure connection

363
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,240
to each side's everybody on anbe

364
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,350
listen bob are thinking that they have a
secure connection with the virtually

365
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,110
other

366
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,760
but around Iraq in different keys so
what we do is we are

367
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,429
generating in a cryptosystem going one
back

368
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,490
you see that arm to surpass are

369
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,429
we r the sake is hashed don't 26
characters and shown to the user

370
00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:36,270
and so the user can at any point in call
you multiple times very fine too

371
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,540
arm the key hash: they were making sure
that the

372
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,590
both schools are on the same key are

373
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,080
iverson at first a bit reluctant sale
key people are going to

374
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,210
omitted or not doing it are because it
seems complicated reading stuff so

375
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,600
but with what we see from our users so
far this at the

376
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,840
actually lost that so because it gives
them a feeling of being in control

377
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,959
so it gives them a feeling of being in
control their destiny in and

378
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,010
doing something for the security zone
the

379
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:10,870
XQ actually works refer to email the
drawback of course is if you don't know

380
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,870
there was a few part no you could be
fooled

381
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:16,140
so rough if somebody is coming along
with the release of a stick at it was a

382
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,280
POS nation

383
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,428
murder 2 can keep you and will call are

384
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:23,860
even if you're asking in the middle of
to call for for something then

385
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,570
he could do minimal it XO technically
doing a minimalistic

386
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,158
countries and the group is not reveal
are but

387
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:35,159
some it is in theory possible so far we
have not seen any evidence that that

388
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,290
something like this has happened

389
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,389
and on a sled really don't don't expect
somebody going to do disc underlings

390
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,350
or because then we could more easily are
going after he was a Swiss directional

391
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,830
microphones that would be much cheaper

392
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,080
sore arm sorta that also busy oakland's

393
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,760
what what we aim to do isn't giving you
security on the wire

394
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,250
so making sure that your call on you
while you're

395
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,360
secure so we cannot prevent an essay
driving

396
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,370
behind he was a van full of equipment
that basically

397
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:08,940
are the reads your thoughts before using
them

398
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,919
arm so than then we simply cannot help
you from that kind of two tho category

399
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,429
than

400
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,450
YouTube account hope is that the audit
was also not tempest

401
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,390
tempers prove the civilian harder for a
civilian market

402
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,500
so it's a best-effort

403
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,760
no firm the crib to design has

404
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,179
has not offered want it as one of them
is that arm this a new

405
00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:34,929
session he generated for each course or
each call

406
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:38,159
Forster to Surrey to go again after 12

407
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,429
sick petition call turn it off or photos
and

408
00:23:41,429 --> 00:23:45,230
expert secrets or are after you press
the red button and hang up

409
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:48,320
no key material stolen device

410
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,408
so that means that if you hang up are
even

411
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:54,600
at that moment to secure their incomes
as when groups to revise

412
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,350
you cannot can do nothing about the last
column so it's gone

413
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,440
um so which also means that the can
arturo also take on you

414
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,850
are any other any other kinda forcing
you to review came a true simply doesn't

415
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,090
work

416
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,540
the it is although the also makes
possible to set up

417
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:17,168
secure communication it was very quickly
arm so we had one customer

418
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:20,669
who requested our own two phones 01

419
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:24,090
to his office address and one gift Rep
to nevers

420
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,830
lets on from Lori local 80 home and some
other states

421
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,399
and apparently the that was one of two
states this is a really

422
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:35,520
are expensive they was lost and are

423
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,790
so you basically we support tripping

424
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,270
all kinds of shipping options as you can
imagine

425
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,990
arm as long as their incomes a week into
are so

426
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:51,290
the for bills go to do was so no two
phones people on rhythms to can assume

427
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,260
and can cause secure immediately on the
that's a great advantage

428
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,730
the system key

429
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:01,790
term this is what we were to grant you
doing here have

430
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,330
arm to use a mobile phones smartphones
PDAs

431
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,740
landline phones for and look and ice tea
and

432
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,810
are we have a subtle adoption for trial
Ryerson

433
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:17,500
satellite system its a single not
covering US but everything else

434
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,399
or not covering America to be precise
term

435
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:25,260
the and we also have an important for
option it's not shown you

436
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,980
and we also often was over IP option
which is basically

437
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,530
only working over from quote who sows
controlled

438
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,830
thirties governor for us because what we
doing this modem passthrough what was a

439
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,908
lie P

440
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:40,080
which as you know me know only works or
iftar

441
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,740
is not too much delay jitter and packet
loss on that

442
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,429
arm so we are constantly developing on
are on the products

443
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,080
or all of them are available for nearly
immediate shipment

444
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,840
sore its that's very nice the

445
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,560
use another another review or on the
models

446
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,520
recu on arm on left side we have two
phones

447
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,460
arm very busy modified former rights
that we have on offer development

448
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,830
we develop stuff for the tour I O and
and for fixed-line stuff

449
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:15,300
are sorted it has become quite an
extensive operation

450
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,560
the last year so we started to talk and
free selling

451
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,158
coming to that later

452
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:29,159
okay we are active basically everywhere
we can

453
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,600
can legally explore to from from Germany

454
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,389
the drama troupe the laws are really in
favor of us no meaning movie

455
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:41,110
we can visit ship to everybody are was
not really evil

456
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,360
a cedar there are some countries like

457
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,970
like China and Russia we are not
officially

458
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:53,090
doing stuff are because deaf in time for
the regulations

459
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,399
and or in Scotland of business to learn
a lot about the practical implications

460
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:57,350
of

461
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,860
are of doing crypto business

462
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,850
are so the and let's start with China in
China

463
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:09,070
we cannot trip to China are because
drawn to the regulations

464
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,870
are meaning we could but we knew would
need to on

465
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,149
obtain a permit for each and a resale
however

466
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:21,700
for some bizarre reason we can super any
has all to Hong Kong

467
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,800
so as we happen to ship a lot of phones
to Hong Kong

468
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,600
term so a and Russell the situation is a
bit more complicated to have

469
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,610
or as: s in China they have severe
internal to the regulations meaning that

470
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,570
in need to register itself

471
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:42,270
her as a crew to use earned in theory
you can only use

472
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,190
are state-approved cryptosystems are
also is not state approved of course

473
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,560
because you can get on the approval if
you are

474
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,550
have a back door or have so we could do
that the the pups he was a student

475
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,790
and as a coolant they're simply doesn't
care are

476
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:01,500
a number of competitors products are
interestingly for sale in Russian

477
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,840
so what what happens of course people
are going to neighboring countries and

478
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,590
binder

479
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,960
buying the stuff it ordeal as their cash
and

480
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,580
are importing them in this heat no the
pockets of the Pens

481
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,678
arm that that works pretty well

482
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,559
term yes or for export restrictions

483
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:22,760
are it is I'm going just because

484
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,780
it seems to be interesting for a lot of
people there

485
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,250
the list of the list of countries under
20 minutes for control

486
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,629
is there's one mister it's too a list
which is the real

487
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,540
the country's weaken a you can think
about shipping to

488
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,080
you could've and of course materials in
a permit but you would never get like

489
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,408
Iran north korea dubious about to come

490
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:48,419
don't from this list but the school on
their own

491
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,340
and saw a movie busy the permit for
everything shipments within their own a

492
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,559
not so nice countries we need a permit
only after

493
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,658
shipment goes to are entities are also
associated was

494
00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:01,590
arm was to secure it sort of government
like military minister for interior

495
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,879
Secret Service stuff like that

496
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:07,429
are in today need me do a permit to to
ship to them

497
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:12,280
then there's a journey across of resumes
in var of war and armed conflict

498
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,649
oh we need to obtain profitability dawn

499
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:19,059
even think about it no we have an
internal policy of

500
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,100
or monitoring the news and not shipping
to

501
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,139
certain zones look currently do not have
been to Israel for this reason

502
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:30,309
are and stuff like that so we we we try
to

503
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:34,139
to stay on the same side of the business
home

504
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,280
interests in addition list which is the
so-called bad guys list

505
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,700
arm that is rather bizarre that

506
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,149
that list contains thousands and
thousands of names among them

507
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:47,970
about 120 different the

508
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,770
writings of Osama bin Laden so like 100
different spellings of his name

509
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:57,360
and then the there're everest's and
they're like the

510
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,369
something else something honey trading
company

511
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:06,510
at the Tryon behind a gas station in
Karachi

512
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,230
that's the address that's in the moguls
do not ship to their

513
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,300
so have no clue a so all

514
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,179
II you like to say that US troops
officials and it's an official

515
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:20,450
public list and if you if you're in
atlanta business in need to have some

516
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,419
subscription to this list and me to
verify we shouldn't that goes on against

517
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:24,800
this list

518
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,639
which is kinda hard because it's such a
bizarre and a.m.

519
00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:34,369
not really the precise lists ordered the
the information it goes in there

520
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,570
seems to be I don't know where they get
it but it

521
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,700
it is not really straightforward a.m.

522
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,460
so basically DSD sings prevented from
just dealing with people who don't want

523
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:44,800
to be

524
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,280
anyone because on its use a troubled

525
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,580
arm so you you're very observant and
thats arsons

526
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,080
the market is big enough we don't really
care for for the city and grey areas too

527
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,139
are we just have to everybody you we can
ship to purchase

528
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:03,389
love people sore

529
00:31:03,389 --> 00:31:07,470
who's buying the stuff are it's also
very interesting to see

530
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,649
because they are not not many

531
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:16,790
I security companies are were have made
a business plan that actually work old

532
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,580
um we started start also doing the
business plan but

533
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,928
your as a ton of it was completely
different from what we expected so

534
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:29,550
one after first sink first quarter

535
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:33,490
you nearly exclusively lift off to
European scrap metal industry

536
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,220
because apparently scrap metal
assumption cutthroat

537
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,770
business that they're really onto each
other

538
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,750
but they also really need to talk to
each other securely sorce someone uses

539
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,610
near perfect for them and so use a lot
of also europeans cripple a mystery

540
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,419
whatever's or youth leader people buying
our stuff or consultants of all kinds

541
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,659
or security business Modric physician

542
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,040
banking finance the kinda stuff lot of
doctor russ was high profile clients

543
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,230
really cannot afford to to be overheard
on what they're doing

544
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,059
we have the large business was human
rights and women's political activists

545
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:16,210
are also international organizations are
we have lot of them on

546
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,760
on our client list or for human rights
organizations and

547
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,899
my middle activists or we have a special
disc on policy though

548
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:28,629
on an individual basis we we give to
them phones for much much cheaper than

549
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:31,809
what amounted to position consultant
would get a surprising

550
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:35,210
because actually these are the people
that we are doing the stuff for

551
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,250
arm these are the people that we really
want to support

552
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,409
so of course we then there's the usual
you've lawyers

553
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:46,010
or even some governments have arms
customers with you police forces

554
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,590
customers who need to protect himself

555
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,990
arm against are drug criminals that have
become so rich that they can

556
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,500
Forza violence police officers so they
are

557
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,460
police force out there who are really in
and surveillance battle was

558
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,190
was alaska from because all it takes is
just you know one

559
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:09,570
corrupt person in switch your ETA

560
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,879
you know cell phone provider and you non
whole

561
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:17,369
operation could be completely out in the
open

562
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,919
and a lot of information leaks that way
use a computer

563
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,369
quality Dept on the line to see if
there's anything bat

564
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:29,710
that as many options that people at
phone companies have

565
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:32,770
to Ida monitor lines et cetera et cetera
so

566
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,869
one example than no and country in
Eastern Europe

567
00:33:37,869 --> 00:33:41,119
our wonderful customers told us a case
or arm

568
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,240
he got an offer from one corrupt
employees phone

569
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,760
company for five thousand dollars a
month

570
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,389
are he would get in CD was all the calls
of its competitor flat

571
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:56,300
and there was also an additional option
to have to Murray transcribed

572
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,800
some others all you but getting a social
so for social text for

573
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:05,800
and for all when he asks or I assume you
have made a symbol for to my competitor

574
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
is a drive-through

575
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,290
course so home so

576
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:13,929
for instance in in countries certain
countries and easier

577
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:17,109
political parties non political parties
have

578
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:21,730
their own intelligence agencies
surveillance capabilities

579
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,820
sore there are countries where this
completely in perfectly normal to

580
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,929
political candidates assume that the
competition is

581
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:34,730
always on the phone so do you do in Cork
course fantastic you travel expenses

582
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,099
are because it did neutral lotto tonight
or to

583
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:41,440
to talk to each other are audit day but
most of solid

584
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,470
it is increasingly are

585
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:47,980
normal phenomenon that people are have
to use 'em

586
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,199
interception sore all kinds of stuff so
the

587
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,710
that they couldn't has become really
cheap so for instance you can buy

588
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,480
the passive interception system for GSM

589
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,740
in the region of sixty thousand dollars
are and that gives you 10

590
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,690
the channels of do use am passive of the
year

591
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,580
so if you want to have a more expensive
system armed that can do also too high a

592
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,589
great interruptions

593
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:15,730
or and coatings for for do cement its
may be doubled the price

594
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,599
but for that you often get already 32
channels are

595
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,420
because of the and it's not like there
is a culture

596
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,810
or earlier days for you busy play man in
the middle

597
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,570
me too do a lot of stuff and know what
you doing but was just switch on like a

598
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,589
police scanner

599
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:36,250
and two get everything am sorta that
that's the route that the state of art

600
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:36,500
and

601
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,250
and technology we think that

602
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,490
you know did will be more and more
people with with

603
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:47,589
this thing called bottom to rate you can
radio

604
00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:51,170
there's a lot of development going on in
software radio

605
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:54,310
where we think that you know even meters
can do this in

606
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,869
certain amount of time in if we would
have made a prediction we thought that

607
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:01,140
by now you would have seen something
like that so it takes longer than we

608
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,990
expected

609
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,060
but at the end of the day emitters will
also be able to

610
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,890
listen to GSM calls that's my opinion at
least you know to a freest on the road

611
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,020
it will be the case a current leader

612
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,720
order stuff to come by on or more gray
market

613
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,040
arm is of relatively mediocre quality
except for one company in Switzerland

614
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,820
that is making really decent equipment
but some legal experts

615
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,339
most of the times just some special how
to attach to a PC in turn

616
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:32,779
or on fascinating is that no
interception on the interception so it

617
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,690
must be pretty boring

618
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,200
arm all of the systems have for listen
at random button

619
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,599
with december's you choose set a lofty
interest lists in to see if there's

620
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,109
something interesting in

621
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:51,598
okay so where are we going arm the
company is

622
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,270
or profitable sore we'll we're growing
moderately not to

623
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,880
not too fast from you continue to part

624
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
group to form to New phone models Sol
Rio

625
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,500
basically means increased innovation
cycles industry meaning that we have

626
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,810
re 12 to 18 months when you for
generation

627
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,270
reforms running on well which as I said
in the beginning is really important

628
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,520
because we have your PE

629
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,240
customers to really need to have to use
a tiny camera whatever phone

630
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,050
the next big step for us is going one
more for work from

631
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,329
securing operating system securing the
voice to secure building as

632
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:31,859
integrated secure system meaning it to
have

633
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:35,089
integrated secure messaging integrated
secure storage

634
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:38,290
so that you can basically everything you
do today was a blackberry but in a

635
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,359
secure fashion

636
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:44,200
we're not going to blackberry but these
things think only on Windows Mobile

637
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,619
arm you look thought about going to

638
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:52,190
to Manuel Linux but arm the problem is
that the distributions

639
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:57,490
for that also in european security good
busy need to rule on the solution for

640
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:58,460
that

641
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:02,099
which is but also for capability so idk
on the

642
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,240
for a moment we'll stick with her was to
Windows Mobile stuff because in ordinary

643
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:06,750
world

644
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,470
we get to support from the necessary
entities to

645
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,940
one of the topics of course traffic
analysis what we

646
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,910
no currently providers content security
meaning

647
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,049
they cannot long no longer listen to
your calls

648
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,930
but we can to prevent him from knowing
who you calling

649
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:29,348
our customers have found a number of or
solutions to that of course

650
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,119
are for instance one head of state
students using our product

651
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,960
has guy running next to him does the
same switcher

652
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,170
has literally the back of Sims with them

653
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,750
into the last table and for

654
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,770
according to know if that's if it's time
of day or after one call whatever

655
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,869
you switch the SIM on Form intends to
form back to to

656
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:54,480
to head of state are and other sites the

657
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,800
are communicating sides have tables
which numbers to

658
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:01,270
current number for for the day so on
this switching in

659
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:05,320
lifters in times of crisis to switching
like every 10 minutes or so

660
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,560
well unit dropping calls to to do that
stuff like that so busy trying to

661
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,820
the make as much noise as possible on on
the traffic a known as a side

662
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,970
no which is now kind of clumsy of course

663
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,460
or sore interesting you are heard it
first from from those

664
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,349
from his head of state and later on rep
that the

665
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:31,020
apparently occur either in Africa has
done the same thing when the bus that to

666
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,650
people

667
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,710
or who words try to sort on iLearn
instead like

668
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,440
26 phones also rendered Jeep and busy
doing

669
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,859
doing the same thing ok is of course not
sustain we need something better so we

670
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:43,380
working

671
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,579
10 minutes we working on that but it's
it's not easy

672
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:52,560
of course we going to IP based her stuff
beyond just not impossible was over IP

673
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,119
but it's also taking some time just
interesting was over IP like

674
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,849
was almond us was that form does not
look refit or a bill of

675
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:05,780
be having a fully no integrated system
like going to mobile going or satellite

676
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,310
and so on

677
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,720
it's really difficult was only
interesting also I P

678
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,609
and oh we also will try to do secure
more beautifully in 3G networks we have

679
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,440
some de Montford

680
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,760
okie so questions no first question we
helped

681
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,990
how much is it them that's a difficult
question actually

682
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,390
no because we we Salam than a lot of
regions of the world

683
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,960
and a the or distributors

684
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,070
are in the countries have love different
pressing

685
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,220
constrictions so are for us. roughly

686
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,160
its in the region of two thousand
dollars per phone before discounts

687
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,490
forcing the phone

688
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:46,510
so that's too that's a rough pricing
home

689
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,619
if you buy more fronts to step 2 sconce
if you're in other Israel to vote it

690
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,480
might be cheaper or more expensive so

691
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,900
but that's the that's the rough the
rough number

692
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,400
other Christians

693
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,530
to questions the first question is do
you have a way of providing users the

694
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,720
capability of doing

695
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,829
binary fingerprinting the software on
the phone

696
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:11,829
both are you provide and the OS and the
second question being

697
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:15,839
how were controlled is the user the
phone have over

698
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,400
their key I wasn't clear on that in the
presentation

699
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,200
'em ok is a binary but no fingerprinting
um do some

700
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,740
on by endorsing a print running or

701
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,760
upon start-up occasion that also runs

702
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,800
a number of protests across for
application to be

703
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,619
to be sure that your own having reviewed
crypt under

704
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:41,300
not to somebody filling the stat to
cryptography

705
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,500
um so we we tried as good as we can but
of course

706
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,940
no if you have to be wise in your hands
you can manipulate as long as you want

707
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,849
and you can even

708
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:55,670
fake stuff like for instance putting in
a demon that

709
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,589
province reading of some memory and
giving a pic to pick the right number of

710
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:00,049
bytes

711
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,490
in the right order to create a road
fingerprint so we we're not putting too

712
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,770
much effort into that

713
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,070
because we know that's easy to
circumvent a few if you're at it

714
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:11,650
arm so reducing cousin was

715
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:17,300
second question was how do you allow the
user maintain control their primary key

716
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,369
termed as the primary key to key is
generated from random

717
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:24,970
and we mean rear a gnome each time a new
collar set up so there's no stop key

718
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,210
material but we

719
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,060
using miss you every random sources I
mean really random source up to heaven

720
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,339
in onto on this on the device like most
from microphone

721
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,930
CPU internal most generous and so on and
creating the

722
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,839
creating the noise for the runs for the
few min from that so there's no stalking

723
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,040
material

724
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,770
regarding I changing the cards in the
phone like every 10 minutes

725
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,880
I wouldn't be possible to just call 100
number or

726
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,510
you know another phone number set up and
then and then punch in the

727
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:00,020
number the actually wanna call and
connect it's difficult

728
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,250
doing that for CST data calls because if
the data call

729
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,320
and do what they would need some sort of
Gateway solution and the

730
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,260
decided against it because it might be
are as a source of town also so take

731
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,730
are or a problem from when somebody sits
on a good in rehearsals all the normal

732
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,829
security burning through

733
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:22,710
so that so that's not really even
solution we thought about it but

734
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:29,690
it re doesn't solve the problem just
just a problem to another dimension some

735
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,890
technical stuff is alright on I so my
question is about

736
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,578
more about your policies on my eyes find
it a little weird

737
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:41,020
you say that in who this committee

738
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,810
useful to you you know the crypto from
can save lives

739
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,950
because places where people are being
oppressed or things are

740
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,930
are difficult this can actually be a
very valuable tool for people

741
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,149
but at the same time winning export to
general definition

742
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,319
regions of conflict I like you mentioned
right now

743
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:04,119
shipping Israel because what's going on
right now but I could see that these

744
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,800
funds to be a very valuable tool for
people living in

745
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,940
lebanon who are trying to the

746
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,300
in communication with their families and
be safe

747
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:17,560
arm okay the business of course in

748
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:21,290
a difficult question are in general what
we try to do is

749
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:27,250
armed bean as accessible as possible to
people who are in trouble

750
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,599
over not being subject to to state

751
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,690
repression you in on you

752
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,280
that's yes living on this is for
instance is on on and do not ship list

753
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,910
so that's that's very simple your
controllers

754
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,980
not so my controls or II cannot simply
aka simply cannot

755
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,910
to Lebanon today so since are four years
ago think

756
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:53,129
homes or there are regions very always
discussing if you want to ship to their

757
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:56,890
we could serve beer but sometimes we
simply do not want to

758
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:00,660
are either because you don't like to
customers so we we

759
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:04,569
retain the right to refuse customers so
if if the customer some real

760
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,569
intelligence agency I really don't want
to ship to them

761
00:45:07,569 --> 00:45:12,060
so were and other customers is OK
they're not ready or friends but

762
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,619
we we have to draw a policy of providing
security to everyone

763
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,760
so even if if you don't like the face
are always so to them because

764
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,930
we have general excise policy on that so
we would

765
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,430
it is a difficult process we cannot come
as late as a general rule it but

766
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:33,770
are you to loosen the laws with Lori try
to take any action that would promote

767
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:38,500
being able to ship these phones to
troubled regions for the purposes of

768
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,660
positive change know the problems that
arm

769
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,118
when you ship into trouble reasons you
never know communing

770
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,930
up with sore I'm we are we had some
cases for in South Africa

771
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:53,819
will we had request to to ship their

772
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:57,319
and we asked text control people to
please verify

773
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:00,990
who do three customers because he
thought it would be a with fishy

774
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,060
and for sits on the real goods and some
seems to be some

775
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,540
collective of human rights activists and
that ended up

776
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,750
was being a group of real but people

777
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,390
sore so we didn't have to them are so

778
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,650
the who process of going to shift to
move on to not trip to

779
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:22,359
is something that's very fluent so the
me the trying to influence lost their

780
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:25,880
because some ppl too small for that so
the other companies like to big

781
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,390
government Petrus were

782
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,828
are you doing it for instance that loop
years not coming from the list

783
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:35,180
are is mostly in part of because

784
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,328
for the oil industry that wants to ship
to use a commit to them

785
00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:43,089
are China's on are is the topic of
discussion for instance on journalist

786
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:47,339
arm the German government will you ones
too

787
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:51,799
be able to ship stuff to china or other
people and politics

788
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,000
don't want to try number two for are so
that this this is a movie

789
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,740
you mom was or a real lobbying and so on
and so on so let's

790
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:05,420
it's not not reasons just curious also
hiring

791
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:10,210
than

792
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,369
her with your lawn baselines

793
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:16,599
you like this could be fun dressing with
the TCPIP stream

794
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:19,240
if you put any thought into running on
your outing or any other method have

795
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,619
actually protecting privacy

796
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:24,819
regarding who's talking to from

797
00:47:24,819 --> 00:47:28,940
were as a reworking on stuff there which
which I really don't want to announce it

798
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,140
because it's not done yet

799
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:33,540
sorry we're we having some really
interesting stuff

800
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,759
in the rooks but on maybe next year or
so on

801
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,760
on a conference I would be ready to
announce that I'll take that as a yes

802
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,240
Chris Newsom the crypto from compromise

803
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,750
call you Hong Kong how exactly

804
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:58,290
on isley on the other side of the phone
how exactly the information

805
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:01,329
I can on the towers themselves are

806
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,140
like I'm missing arts I don't get a
custom week we're a good physical

807
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,040
constraints

808
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:09,690
constraints on the trip to fund terms or
call the other phone call

809
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:13,119
and how exactly are those how physically
he's

810
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,670
is this kind of thing into the phone
system from

811
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:20,450
sordid or what it was we do with the
money for the the flesh of the operating

812
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:21,180
system

813
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,328
on also holds or application status to
the physical part of the

814
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:28,640
on the phone arm for the for a GSM
network would reduce

815
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:33,578
as a set seize the day to call nurses
today to call requires a bit better

816
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:36,710
do you think originally was called us

817
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:41,560
so we need to have relatively good
coverage to press a tropical

818
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,839
but in most areas of the world that
works most of the time

819
00:48:44,839 --> 00:48:48,130
so that that's so we have fanned in
general we have a number of ninety

820
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,630
percent call success rate

821
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:54,089
on on mama G's on the troops

822
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:57,450
you can you tell me in like how exactly

823
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:01,930
on the other and the phone right do you
have to put something on the towers to

824
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:02,879
be able to do this

825
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,060
I'll it works end to end most people me
too and also

826
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,400
over people need to has no matter if
it's not it's not like no other might

827
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,079
look like in James Bond movies but there
is a secure line

828
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,260
but its real or that's real internal
corruption

829
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,480
you both both in so great know people
have the paid two thousand dollars for

830
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,430
this film

831
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:25,290
or download the free Windows client you
can also download a free Windows client

832
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:26,900
and he was basically uses from

833
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,440
against to people cockpit Carter
anywhere in the world

834
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,750
issue correct

835
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,510
okay we have now free we have the
scientists stop

836
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:42,260
on August a free freeman slipped so we
have 11 workers and please

837
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,020
okay those places in the world was more
popular less popular

838
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,589
east germany West Germany defense a.m.

839
00:49:49,589 --> 00:49:53,290
we have riverdance distribution arm

840
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,460
that is roughly equal to

841
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,190
population that has server relatively
high

842
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:04,849
gross domestic income sore we have

843
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:07,930
so that that stir the rough measures
would of course

844
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,910
we used to joke that we can predict
crisis

845
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,799
no when we see demand going up in a
certain countries and

846
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:19,430
is a relatively high chance that this
country will be in trouble

847
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,288
arm within the next month so the that is

848
00:50:24,289 --> 00:50:28,029
so rough measure them of course the

849
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,539
later developed countries are have two
highest demand like you

850
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:36,430
are use in Europe home US this is where
most of the stuff goes

851
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:40,460
real so for a team-high demand in Asia
so we added videos

852
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,420
they don't use on the troops and from
most customers

853
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,509
especially large ones we really don't
know over two phones

854
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:52,329
are used because international customers
like international organizations

855
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:55,789
arm international human rights
organizations the key for the phones

856
00:50:55,789 --> 00:50:59,980
activist to travel around the world

857
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,150
okay and thanks very much thank you
