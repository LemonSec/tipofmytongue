1
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:10,670
I'm sorry welcome everyone

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:15,950
it is Saturday 20 100 hours area be that
means it's time for breaking down with a

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,150
trust presented to you

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:24,150
my number one 25 set already I still see
a lot of activity outside are people

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:31,590
still filtering and or should I

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,890
just to go okay then

7
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,590
for alright so my name is Seth

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,300
I'll talk breaking down love trust
before it again

9
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:52,320
I S one ask a question I'll who here
uses pgp in

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,750
some variants here has keep their okay
cool

11
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,770
so I the same here not know

12
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,790
what it is as anybody here 90 anything
about

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,989
pgp okay arm

14
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:09,490
of we'll pick up but there's about then
on but it's an encryption program

15
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:12,640
and its well

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,870
used all over the world it's consider
the standard for

17
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,040
doing strong corruption so me

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,060
talk about it so hopefully I'll pick
this up but for those of you who are pgp

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:29,090
and I use that in a general sense not
the PGP Corporation sense

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:33,490
I who would sign this key right here

21
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,190
given that information would anybody
here

22
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:41,630
sign this key nice I'm

23
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,420
assuming that somebody gave it to you
and verified the fingerprint

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,720
would anybody here sinus K I see a show
of hands

25
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,798
not a single away

26
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,330
Maxwell okay itself nobody here would
sign Aki

27
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,509
when anybody here actively refused to
sign

28
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:04,650
K okay so few people and most to me or
just

29
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,169
not wanting to commit to a stand yes

30
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,290
you guys don't want to respond to my
reading question

31
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,200
well what would you need to know before
you sign a key like this to all those

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,269
people that wouldn't sign it

33
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:21,349
and I okay so you just wouldn't sign it

34
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:26,649
okay

35
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,930
proof that the email goes to the person
holding the key

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:36,930
some ID

37
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:53,390
okay so you would just care about the
fingerprint and nothing else you would

38
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,939
still sign it okay depending on if you
know the person

39
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,370
anybody else one offer standpoint

40
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,510
provider ship how do you prove ownership

41
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,129
okay for from what what about the ID

42
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,120
okay

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,159
well everybody else are okay

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,390
well think about this question as

45
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,079
i'd give the talk and I will come back
to this sometime at the end

46
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:35,079
yeah hah

47
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:40,200
that's a very good question up

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,200
okay okay after drinking before the key
signing with sinus K

49
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,230
so keep this in mind as I go through

50
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,730
are the very first thing I'm going to do
is a short

51
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,980
short version above what the Web of
Trust is just to give everybody

52
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,629
a general context love what it is I'm
talking about here

53
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,319
and first question is why Web of Trust

54
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,370
and the whole point is to trust the
validity of keys you've never seen

55
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,040
before

56
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,668
so that's me up on top there and three
cheese underneath her keys that I've

57
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:20,269
signed

58
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:24,919
and the third row is somebody I know has
signed a key in the fourth row somebody

59
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,930
are that they know he signed their key
and 0.2 this exercise

60
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,190
is that despite the fact that the person
on the bottom is a number of steps away

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,250
I can still using this Web of Trust

62
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,380
try trust the key at the bottom that is

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,250
three steps away from me and everything
will be fine and

64
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,570
this sort of thing is in use all the
time real-world scenarios I'll show you

65
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:48,729
some examples of that

66
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,440
it's just taking a well-known social
phenomenon

67
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,219
and translating it over into the world
of computers carry

68
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,820
yes

69
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,860
yes it is using social networking like I
know you and I trust you

70
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,159
and you know that guy and you trust back
I and if I trust your judgement

71
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,580
that I can trust the friend of a friend
trusted introductions and

72
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:19,580
trust no one depends on who the person
is

73
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,870
I so here's an example Web of Trust

74
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,479
and I just for this image down of the
Nets I don't know who that is

75
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,620
but here is an example love our the

76
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,719
crossing nature's between keys actually

77
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,729
know it's the other weaver yeah

78
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,099
so

79
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:45,500
this is a graphical representation
whatsoever trust looks like

80
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,719
and it's just it goes in multiple
directions

81
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:53,130
and I'm sure you're all familiar with
this concept if

82
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,659
you have friends I'm not sure that
everybody here as friends

83
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:00,159
but if you have friends are you even
prolly if you don't have friends are

84
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,000
familiar with this is just whether
you're better about it or not

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,729
so I'm sure everybody is from my with us
if anybody has any questions

86
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,760
just stop many times like wave your arm
show hey you guys up there

87
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,409
a question I'm gonna go quickly through
this introductory part

88
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:20,940
and just to get a either way so think
about the weather trust

89
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,440
is it's really more like a web
validation by signing a key

90
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,830
you're supposed to sign a key only when
you know that the key is complete

91
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,419
without

92
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:34,389
so if i trust somebody but I don't trust
that the key is actually there's

93
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,729
I want sin que and reason for this is

94
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:42,060
quite simple it's you're not handling
identities and verifying

95
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,310
denny's your verifying keys and the
purpose of this

96
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,740
is to send security now or I just
encrypt files in some way or another

97
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,279
that somebody else will be the only
person who was able to read it

98
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,669
so when you sign a key you don't sign a
key into you know that's completely

99
00:06:58,669 --> 00:06:59,299
valid

100
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,180
no matter how much you trust the person
if somebody else walks up to you with

101
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,830
the key with their name on it you're not
gonna trust the key

102
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,250
so it's a two-part fact are the other
thing that you're doing in terms of

103
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:13,890
Trustees you're selling a trust level
for introductions

104
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,310
so there's a notion assigned trust
verses

105
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,070
the notion i've calculated trust
assigned trust

106
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:24,719
are the decisions that I make about the
people around me

107
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,890
I might trust Alice trust bob

108
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,039
but not trust Charlie those are the

109
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,950
assignments I'm making a first-level
decoration

110
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:38,550
this is who I trust this is who I don't
trust after that

111
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,180
it's calculated trust so I can trust
somebody

112
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,680
but not trust their judgment so a second
level person

113
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,360
their trust has to be calculated by way
of the first person that I know

114
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,240
I get more into this and I love it so
excuse that you sign

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,560
a relief validated now trust is implied
in this

116
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,469
but you're going one step further and
your validating the key as well

117
00:08:01,469 --> 00:08:05,550
validation of a key implies trust not
the other way around

118
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,610
unsigned keys for keys are not signed by
you

119
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,839
are trusted so you can say I've never
seen this came before

120
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,300
it does not have my signature on it I
have not personally verified it

121
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,620
but I still trusted I still believe
based on the introducer

122
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,159
whoever introduced me to this key I
trust this K

123
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,979
so that is validation versus trust and
the way you do this

124
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:30,680
a lot of times people miss out on this
extremely critical part

125
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,700
when using PGP is you have to update

126
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,810
your trusty and GPG this is the command
to do it there are other some are

127
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,209
commands and GPG

128
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:44,350
or pgp and other programs but unless you
assign trust values

129
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,740
for introductions to all your keys you
will never get beyond

130
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,880
one step in this trust network so you
will have

131
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,579
all the keys that you've signed that you
trust but I must use a

132
00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,130
how much trust their judgment never have
anybody else in your network

133
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,220
and this is an example using GPG to

134
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,550
set the trust level on somebody's key

135
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,350
you don't say I believe this key is
valid or not that's implied when you

136
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,220
sign it

137
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,329
what you're doing is you say how much do
you trust this user to correct we verify

138
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:20,430
other users keys and examples they
differ by looking at passports checking

139
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,690
fingerprints from different sources

140
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,709
are just the way that other people
handle introduction

141
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,440
so you know its I don't know I won't say
I don't trust them

142
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,450
I trust marginally I trust him fully I

143
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,829
this is sort of like the distinction
like oh yeah my breast

144
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:41,950
my my best friend Susie she's an awesome
person

145
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,050
tramp I my best friend Susie she's an
awesome person but she always dates

146
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,230
assholes

147
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,660
you're saying that she's your best
friend and you trust her with anything

148
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,529
but you don't trust her judgement other
people and that is what you're doing

149
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,740
here you're setting a trust level

150
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:05,450
on how well that they deal with other
people not with you

151
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,550
and some people might find this one
kinda funny here's an example validity

152
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,360
versus trust

153
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,880
I I don't know who knows that person on
their

154
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,740
but this is a person where I know this
key belongs to him

155
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,200
by I'm absolutely 100 percent

156
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,680
us that this key belongs to him

157
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,529
and I'm also 100 percent positive that
any signature he makes another key is

158
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:33,439
worthless

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,209
it's not because he's a bad guy it's not
because I don't like an is one of my

160
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:37,800
friends

161
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,290
is a cool person I I think he's alright
under

162
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,560
but he does live under a bridge and

163
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,209
as a result his on interactions with
other people

164
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:56,209
aren't really trust so I trust his key
but I do not trust his judgement

165
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,279
the trust database is kept private it is
for your eyes

166
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:08,820
only your signatures on other keys
asserting that the key is valid and the

167
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,019
user ID is valid

168
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,139
our public by whether you trust somebody
else's judgment is private

169
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,500
so if you say I don't trust this guy
that person will never know

170
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,460
it is for your reference only

171
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,790
yes when when you validate somebody's
keep a signature on it

172
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,459
and it becomes a permanent part of their
case

173
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,480
yeah you upload it to a key server and
then anybody else can get it and they

174
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,690
can see that you've

175
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,529
validated the information but they don't
know how you trust your judgement

176
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,020
the trusting judgment is for your
personal trust calculations on way it

177
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,819
doesn't affect

178
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,340
anybody else's so if you have signed
back I ski

179
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,460
and you trust him completely I don't
know

180
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,320
so I don't know if he's gonna try to
screw me you guys might be best friends

181
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,660
never screw you but he might screaming
so I'm not gonna trust him

182
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,910
but you can so the trust judgments are
for you and

183
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:10,310
your

184
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,590
arm that is just what the key to use for
its not really

185
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:19,060
applicable to to this discussion I can
explain later like

186
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,760
so that is the level of trust as I may
have any questions on the love trust

187
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,040
before I

188
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,430
I move on yes

189
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,000
okay

190
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,570
yes there there are public key servers

191
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,960
and you can upload your key to a key
server so that anybody can get it

192
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,080
and the point of the Web of Trust is
that so

193
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,480
you don't need to personally hand your
key to somebody else

194
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,890
somebody else can sign your key and then
uploaded to the key server

195
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,220
and because a digital signature requires

196
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,840
their private key if you see the digital
signature on it even if they didn't get

197
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,370
it from you directly they know they can
still trust it because the signatures

198
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:03,220
good okay

199
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,450
well I guess I'll proceed on of trust
and the whole point of all the signing

200
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,400
there are a few goals assigning a key
and people often get one or a couple but

201
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:12,680
not

202
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,720
I love them are the first goal is to
verify the keys

203
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,990
accurate and this one everybody usually
gets so

204
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,050
with a key server if you download a key
of the web there is a possibility that

205
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,180
somebody will watch man in the middle
attack

206
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,490
and give you a bad see and serve the
real key you're trying to get

207
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,780
so the wave this is foiled is by having
a fingerprint

208
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,850
it is you take a hash have the key and
you're just verifying certain bites

209
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,920
I love the key basically through a known
secure channel and

210
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,020
in this case unknown secure channel is
almost always meaning the person face to

211
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,620
face

212
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,790
and exchanging the Short Strand bytes
and

213
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,040
that way there's no possibility of
Carmel information over the phone can

214
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,079
work if you're familiar with persons
voice

215
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,290
over the Internet is possible if you're
using

216
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,329
a channel previously secured by

217
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,070
one of these secure channels it is
entirely up to your discretion but the

218
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,340
usual way it works is face to face in
person

219
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,580
I have my fingerprint on my business
cards so every time I get a business

220
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,110
card

221
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:19,780
my fingerprints right there some they
can see it Tamaki works

222
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:24,550
second goal is to verify that the key
ownership is accurate

223
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:29,390
hands this basically means that somebody
is not making keys in your name

224
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,480
and going around and trying to convince
people that

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,590
if you send messaging cryptid to this
key

226
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,760
that's actually going to this person so
I could put any name I wanted on a key I

227
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,290
could put

228
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,569
george bush on a key and to go love

229
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,860
verify McKee ownership accurate is to
make sure that the person

230
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,880
who owns the key with the name george
bush is actually george bush or

231
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,380
do you think is the person named george
bush in there is a distinction there

232
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,510
which are getting to where

233
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,530
so the way this is usually done is to
check the name on the key against the

234
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,630
name on a photo ID

235
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,610
people generally trust government-issued
documents for some reason or another

236
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,730
and if you can show a driver's license
or passport

237
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,410
that has the name on it and names on the
key then

238
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,449
obsession nine-tenths of the law that
plus the photo on it I

239
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:24,470
you generally assume that person's legal
name for

240
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,670
whatever that's worth is the same as the
name on a key in the purse and the

241
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,980
abstract identities

242
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:36,980
yes

243
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,100
exactly

244
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,730
and I'll get into that I'm so the way
this usually works is either the photo

245
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,260
ID

246
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,630
and people usually put email an email
address some key as well

247
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,900
so the way this is usually verified is
by emailing

248
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,080
signed key to that email address and the
theory is if the person can

249
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,020
need email sent to that address then
they must be the honor that

250
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,250
this is not always the case I don't
really

251
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,100
feel comfortable with this but thats
common practice and that's how most

252
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,950
people do it and the third thing which
is really the most important part

253
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:21,140
by the least tangible part is verifying
the key identity

254
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,439
binding so user ID's are only there for
human convenience

255
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,900
when you have a name attached to a key
the only purpose that name is there

256
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,560
is because when you think about other
people you generally think I've them

257
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,870
by a certain so if

258
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,160
hi no you know so that guy over there

259
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,300
I don't think I've him has that guy over
there I don't always visualize them in

260
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,990
my head it's a lot easier to use named
Brandon

261
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,629
as the person that represents that
person talks dropped

262
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,120
so the user ID's are there for human
convenience

263
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,829
and by verify McKee identity by me

264
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:04,150
what you're doing is you're saying this
key material is associated with this

265
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,400
individual or group or whatever I a name
is an important

266
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,589
the details are important to you just
know that if you send a message it's

267
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,299
going to

268
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,379
whoever you think it's going to that is
the most important part

269
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,909
and it is also the goal is the

270
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:25,909
stated explicitly the least

271
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,290
you can have multiple user ID is on a
key you can have as many as you want

272
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,590
I he's I i'm

273
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:51,590
I'm guessing think you're asking about
multiple user ID is

274
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:14,980
I'm not for sure that works yes

275
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:19,250
you signed you sign the user ID is on a
key individually on

276
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,200
hands the signature if you change like
you're not supposed to be on changes

277
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,909
already is a

278
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:29,510
doesn't work so on you can have multiple
user ID's

279
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,330
and signing one user ID makes the entire
key valid

280
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,990
but it only means in his up to the
application

281
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,929
to to determine whether user ID is
trusted

282
00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:45,559
verses whether the key is trusted so if
you have five different email addresses

283
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,990
somebody consign wanna your five user ID
is

284
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,630
and then the key is considered validated

285
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,320
by that other key by for the individual
user ID's

286
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,470
I it is left entirely up to the user the
application handling it whatever

287
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,500
to determine that not only is the key
valid

288
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:12,500
but the user ID that has been signed as
trusted its its per user ID is how you

289
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,159
keep you can't

290
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,240
yet because then you could just sign a
user ID completely change it and it

291
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:24,570
defeats the purpose of its again the
these are the goals of signing

292
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,590
key and the third one is what I'm going
to be focusing on through the stock

293
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,860
and a little more explanation on that

294
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,390
I mention this before signatures are
actually on user ID's and not on a key

295
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,059
itself

296
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,980
so you have to pick your User ID when
you're signing somebody's K

297
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,750
and a lot of people will have their name
in the email address

298
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,549
and an additional comments sometimes in
their user ID

299
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,840
and sometimes you can verify name not
email

300
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,918
or the other way around and if this
happens

301
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,950
than to you sign the entire user ID
can't sign a certain Trankov

302
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,690
fights the user ID can say I believe the
name but not

303
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,110
email so this scares people off from
signing thing sometimes

304
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,710
causes people to send email addresses

305
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,090
sign key and song that

306
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:21,260
that is a verification love email
address it's catchy its tenuous but for

307
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,020
the most part

308
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,210
it works on the fingerprints

309
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:28,549
his party verified key material on again
this is

310
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:31,600
implied any you any signature so

311
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,090
you sign one user ID the entire key key
material is good but the identity is not

312
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:37,549
good

313
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:42,700
and this is very very confusing to
people who are not familiar with

314
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,140
the inner workings GP and how it works I
used my

315
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,860
as my mail reader hands it will actually

316
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,390
work at the user ID's and see if you're
saying something email lookup

317
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,730
emails in the user ID's and see if that
particular user ID has been

318
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,380
has been signed by dorky and

319
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,140
give you a warning saying I don't know
this person even though the key is valid

320
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,049
if not not everything does that some
things completely ignore that may just

321
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:14,649
go over the keys valid

322
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:18,309
for says it's fine do whatever and I can
fight

323
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:22,070
president at White House dot gov is a
user ID on Mikey

324
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,439
and I wouldn't be able to read an email
going to that address but people might

325
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,419
still try to send encrypted email

326
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:35,929
with my kids address it's stupid work
that is one problem that needs to be

327
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:37,669
fixed and people need to be aware of

328
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:44,669
because it is not universal yes you can
yes

329
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,520
yes but what its it's different

330
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,210
in the sense that its it's like guilt by
association

331
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,340
if they signed one user ID and they go

332
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,899
okay this key is good and and later on

333
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:09,899
I had a user ID they will the
application might not okay we'll say you

334
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,370
say you accidentally do a GPG

335
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,230
refresh keys and Po and new signature so
you can expand

336
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:20,340
I'm sorry

337
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:24,010
I'm sorry he okay okay I i understand.

338
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,139
I he asked what happens I if the

339
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:33,000
additional user ID assigned is added
afterwards he says that it's not the

340
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,770
same key

341
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,330
because if I add an extra user ID
afterwards then

342
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,790
I he has a copy of my key and it's not
the same

343
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:44,030
K and I said it's or is that

344
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,230
you're asking that just a bit or what
would you like

345
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,399
for question archive microphone

346
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:57,139
I ample my comment was that if you give
me your key and I sign it because I

347
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:00,570
trust it and then you later on at
president at White House dubbed gulf

348
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,600
that I will not half that copy of the
key so I will not be confused into

349
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,809
trusting

350
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,690
that signature and I think if I do ATP
TV fresh

351
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:12,940
I'm human too could you tell me what the
new identities are

352
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,909
and say you know this is a new press the
white house that covered entity do you

353
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:17,280
wanna

354
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,760
trust us enough it will not actually do
that on

355
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,240
and why inform you that new identities
have been added

356
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,470
by what you're assuming is that you are
using GPG directly

357
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,120
on there are many programs that build on
top of GPG

358
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,240
on for example I use my as a mail reader
I use Thunderbird

359
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,389
as a mail reader and these programs

360
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:42,960
the because they operate at the
higher-level

361
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,399
they won't use the output of GPG and
make decisions accordingly

362
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:50,639
and they will not the programs that you
may use

363
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:54,100
I you being the general you not
necessarily you individually you say

364
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,830
that you don't

365
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,639
do stuff like this but somebody else who
gets one of these programs like

366
00:23:58,639 --> 00:23:59,780
Thunderbird

367
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,520
might just say okay well my email
program

368
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,789
is going to run this again and it's
going to tell me whether I

369
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:11,480
trusted or not it might not make the
same security decisions that you do

370
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,740
okay I i don't know about all the stuff
out obviously but did you file a bug

371
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,250
report to different people than

372
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,450
I have not because it is it's not really
a security issue

373
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,100
its well

374
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,200
it is it is a design flaw it is a matter
of personal preference

375
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,429
I don't like it for the average user who
want something that's easy to use

376
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,260
the the arguments on the other side can
be made well if you've signs the key

377
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,460
thing you should be familiar what

378
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,950
what's in the case hands

379
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,399
I don't I i agree with you I definitely
do agree with you and

380
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:50,100
I I can send one report by I don't
expect it to be fixed

381
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,590
because they say if you that there are
there counter-argument will be is

382
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,689
if you update your keyring you should
personally verify

383
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,580
every I D and that hands

384
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,639
user judgment we stopping ask you a yes
or no question whether you trust

385
00:25:05,639 --> 00:25:09,389
because we are leaving it up to you and
it is up to you whether you say yes or

386
00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:10,020
no

387
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,059
too trusting it but they present you
with misleading information sometimes

388
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:18,559
in that case by saying you've signed
this case so you think it's good

389
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,480
but we can verify this identity

390
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,419
I'm so it's not really a bug it's a user

391
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,020
issue okay I will I will do that

392
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,960
on and the bottom line with that is it

393
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,700
easier to for the user than to hack the
system

394
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,799
and users I either and

395
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,070
with Qatar Griffey unfortunately users
either generally know what they're doing

396
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,340
completely or don't know that while so
it's easier to four people

397
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,539
when they're getting into it and that of
gives people a bad

398
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,419
taste in their mouth about using this
encryption stuff in general

399
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,630
and better education is needed

400
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,620
for this kind of stuff which is
wondering talk so I'm just trying to say

401
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,960
don't trust this kind of thing always
say no if you have any doubts whatsoever

402
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,049
for tasks

403
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:16,289
do you trust this

404
00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:21,360
either any other questions before I get
back to key identity binding

405
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,070
of okay arm this is one common arguments
that is made

406
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,520
a key signing parties and this actually
the stock started

407
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,539
two years ago Def Con when I was at a
key signing party there

408
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:38,600
and there were four people at this case
I'm art

409
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,080
there is me miss other guy who is very
strict about checking

410
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,869
you I photo ID's had already signed by
ke side

411
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:51,240
I care about him and two other people
who didn't want to identify by their

412
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,250
real names

413
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,470
well 11 into are if necessary

414
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,639
but she didn't have any supporting
evidence

415
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:02,240
that she was really who she's going to
be and the other guy was like screw you

416
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,210
I'm not showing you my real name

417
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:08,300
it doesn't matter because it's on my K
so he walked away from this key signing

418
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,730
party without signing anybody skis

419
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:14,440
I thought that was pretty stupid because
the guy who refused to give out his real

420
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,399
name

421
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,570
was speaking at Def Con under the alias

422
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,790
that he gave and the areas that was on
his case

423
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,230
so he went out in front of more than a
thousand people and identified himself

424
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,139
by

425
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:29,350
a made up name and everybody in the
audience one

426
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,480
okay right on that's who you are cool
and

427
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,290
everybody in the audience accepted more
than a thousand people said

428
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,720
okay will take that as what you might
call yourself

429
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,510
and this guy would not view that as
acceptable for signing a key

430
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,520
with that alias on because he wanted to
see photo ID

431
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,030
so there is no way to verify hand

432
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,408
is a very very now yes

433
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:02,470
as a single yes okay well

434
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,639
what my

435
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:09,490
okay who's this guy

436
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,149
okay dark tangent was the first thing
that is said

437
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:16,760
DT Jeff Moss would you sign

438
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,570
with you in the general sense for
anybody here sign a key

439
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,428
that this guy gave you that had the
names are tangent

440
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:29,059
to you know I'm already you identified
him by me

441
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:32,530
do you know him by you

442
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,799
you saw a photo of this guy this this
this random guy

443
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,129
and you identified him first as dark
tangent if this guy here

444
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,929
were to give you a key that's a dark and
it on it would you sign

445
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:48,770
okay you what would anybody here not
sign

446
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:52,020
okay we have this number of people who
would as area

447
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:58,960
offer why they wouldn't

448
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,330
what okay so so you don't know him

449
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,730
is there anybody here from who is
identified this guy

450
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,179
start engine not signs K

451
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:14,149
10

452
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:18,090
okay I if it's just because now it's you
don't know years

453
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,419
the fact that I'm I know who he is or
not and i computer proof that I know who

454
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:25,500
is not is completely irrelevant from the
question of whether or not to I would

455
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,030
sign is key

456
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,639
if he because I do I I know thousands of
people are not gonna

457
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:36,260
sign thousands people's keys I have
Michael nice hair assigning

458
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,700
is a I don't see why you're copping the
when I would sign to ski with

459
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,960
when I know this person because those
are two completely separate issues i'm

460
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,850
talking about this in the context of
iraqi signing party you're intentionally

461
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,899
going to be signing party supporters
seem obvious reason okay

462
00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:54,379
I i'm talking about the context of you
are trying to actively build the weather

463
00:29:54,379 --> 00:29:55,730
trust

464
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:02,730
I guess I should have said that
forgetting sorry

465
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,950
that's part of it that's part of it but
not all over

466
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:10,460
let's move on arm

467
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:14,220
so who's this guy

468
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,760
okay Eric for leap

469
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,230
with anybody sign this guy is key

470
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:28,190
if you need identified himself has a
manual goldstein

471
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:33,100
you would sign his case okay a manual
gold seen as a fictional character in a

472
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,119
book

473
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:40,480
a manual goldstein is not a real person
this guy doesn't fucking exist

474
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,299
he just he likes to call himself
Emmanuel Goldstein

475
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,850
it's an identity yes by

476
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,159
it's the same back it's an identity

477
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,720
he calls himself dark tangent he calls
himself Jeff Moss one

478
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,080
applicable point its just the same just
because we're at 2600 conference and

479
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,010
Sativa

480
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:06,658
Def Con conference are somebody chooses
the identity that they want to present

481
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:07,340
themselves

482
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,720
as and it doesn't matter or it shouldn't
matter

483
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,960
with is the argument I'm making whether
they present

484
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,510
a fake name or real name as long as
you're able to bind to the name to the

485
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,230
identity

486
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,580
verifying the identity you're not
verifying

487
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:29,580
the fact that this is the name on the
person's birth certificate

488
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:38,230
on your grass King about court papers
and his name and knows

489
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,740
arm is his name in the court papers
actually manual goldstein

490
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,210
I'm sorry it is both okay yes

491
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,220
so the AK then if you consider that
acceptable

492
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,830
to tie that N that and that's great but
I can be like

493
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,309
my name is Emmanuel Goldstein and then I
can go out and I can

494
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:02,158
register WWW dot faulk RIAA dot com

495
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,340
get sued by them and then in the core
proceeding so be like South Rd

496
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,730
AKA emmanuel goldstein

497
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,020
did do you do you really trust that do
you really think that

498
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:16,129
nobody else could do that i mean this
guy is well-known

499
00:32:16,129 --> 00:32:19,210
and high-profile so it's a lot easier to
verify

500
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,690
but would you verify anything like that
as well ask

501
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:26,950
if the answer is no then it's not

502
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,470
I'm something that automatic recounts

503
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,359
sorry she's I'm ginseng microphone with
you

504
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,879
if you wanna come up on stage with me
and even snow an encore

505
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:43,649
where where while

506
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:46,889
Group Inc what whether or not you're

507
00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:50,980
you're signing so many keys does not
only depend on the identity of the

508
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,460
person

509
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,080
I might not be I might I might not want
to associate myself with you

510
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,399
and not sign a key I might not want
associate myself with

511
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,480
either Eric or with Jeff that the whole
purpose of the key is to be able to send

512
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,149
somebody encrypt and stuff

513
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:09,399
so only that person can read it and it
doesn't matter

514
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:12,649
what way will you attached to that
person

515
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:16,740
as long as only that person can get it
what does it matters what labels

516
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,480
a kiss circus her goals this is somewhat
different in in building a web of trust

517
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,460
because

518
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,000
my weapon trust me if you look at my key
you will you will find people that

519
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,429
that that that I have some sort of
binding with

520
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:33,379
and not like my arch enemies just
because I've seen a driver's license

521
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:37,369
okay okay completely different

522
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:41,340
that will definitely go through court
papers okay so what you're saying is you

523
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,690
define trust completely different way

524
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,929
and that's acceptable I i'm talking
about trusting

525
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,330
in terms of using the GPG framework on

526
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,309
white I will sign somebody ski even if I
think they're complete and total scumbag

527
00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:56,109
who always lie to me

528
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:59,850
FA show proper fingerprint verification

529
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,389
and user ID that associates the key with
them

530
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:06,859
I will sign it even if I think they're
lying asshole because

531
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:10,520
the only reason I'm using the key is to
send them crafted material

532
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,649
and to get accepted stuff to that guy

533
00:34:13,649 --> 00:34:16,699
whoever back I may be sure okay so

534
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,330
yeah okay so if in that sense I agree
that there's no point in

535
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,810
signing a million people identity and
web of trust

536
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:28,980
okay well I mean is that is the kind of
fell so they're they're tying

537
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:35,580
if you would like to come up and argue
with me you're welcome to rocky this

538
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,609
if you wanna introduce yourself first
but you have to drink

539
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:43,899
those the rules of the arena forget the
other mic on

540
00:34:43,899 --> 00:34:47,290
on I'm think on

541
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:52,310
atom smasher and i have an article on
PGP key signing in the winter 05 06

542
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,460
article a

543
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,670
2600 magazine for the record despite our
differing opinions about how to handle

544
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,670
this stuff like kiwi we do not agree on
everything

545
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:05,200
I was more than happy to help improve
read the article and I trust his

546
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,359
judgement

547
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:09,520
so even if we disagree I trust his
judgement

548
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,830
South that and down most where we differ
in opinions I think it's probably

549
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,080
on the issue identify love the

550
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,690
for verifying the identity up the key
ownership

551
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:25,100
um I said my name is Adam smasher

552
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,060
I've got off the top my head I can think
of three different birth certificates

553
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,259
have mine with three different names

554
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,549
okay arm so

555
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,290
I kinda think that if somebody builds up
a reputation

556
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:44,609
as emmanuel goldstein or is dark tangent
or whatever their handle is

557
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,569
that their reputation under that
identity

558
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,250
establishes them to a certain extent
with an identity

559
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,339
and I don't think that's exclusively
different then a legal name

560
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:01,569
to a large extent and also but that's
what I'm arguing right here

561
00:36:01,569 --> 00:36:04,890
bad I mean if we go to the next slide

562
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:10,609
yeah

563
00:36:10,609 --> 00:36:13,910
I agree with you on that okay so now
when I would say then

564
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:17,210
from there is that once we establish
someone's identity

565
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,790
that we can then go ahead and sign their
key if they've established themselves

566
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,450
under that identity

567
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,990
and also because where establishing

568
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:29,839
on if you read the article and don't
just go ahead and post

569
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:34,040
the the key once you sign it but in
Kripke send it to them

570
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,160
so that you're requiring that somebody
with controller that email address

571
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,879
then has control of the key that they
can decrease your signature on it

572
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,009
then they can upload it to a key server
Eve then established

573
00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:51,810
the their identity partly through the
reputation of whatever handle that is

574
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,230
and partly through their email address

575
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:58,430
I'm gonna be I'm gonna sort of a great
atom smasher here and the

576
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:01,839
the example that i'm gonna raise but
first point i've

577
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,839
order at that serial killer I think for
the coppers Emmanuel Goldstein the movie

578
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,790
ok ours is running but

579
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,310
so so what about what about the scenario
like a a a public

580
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:20,609
open source project where you interact
his personal time

581
00:37:20,609 --> 00:37:23,930
you have no idea if they are successful
identity are

582
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:27,620
I mean were really transition to the the
21st century here identities to be

583
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:31,120
divorced I love the physical person
through three technologies like like

584
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,200
more and what not I me that there could
be criteria to establish the fact that

585
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,700
you know this is the entity that I
relate with a up frequently

586
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,630
I don't have time to answer for you so
the only thing I can say is if I could

587
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,750
finish my talk

588
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,430
with hand so that by which I'm more than
happy some you now do

589
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,640
it's not you but it's a return is
something I also have to answer that

590
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,080
sometime later

591
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,270
his

592
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,390
itself yeah I'm I wanna see there's

593
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,730
anyway it II wonder if there's actually

594
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:05,859
anyway to verify an eidetic FRU

595
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:09,009
and identity Foley to even really have

596
00:38:09,009 --> 00:38:12,750
identity I'm not sure you do do what
what makes

597
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:19,130
a man what what what is a person

598
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:26,130
here

599
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,279
no thats that that's a legitimate
question

600
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:33,660
you're talking about identity identity
is

601
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,170
and intangible thing it comes down to
you and only you decide

602
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,520
and for me and my head its if I can
associate

603
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,830
this key with that guy or that girl as
the case may be

604
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,520
then that's good enough for me if you
would like to overthink at me like what

605
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,670
makes a man

606
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:55,299
you know what what is really what what
defines a person what is their identity

607
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:59,900
then good for you know I just wanna send
another in essence me in the sense that

608
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,299
like anything can be forced to
impersonate I mean I

609
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,810
know plenty of people with fake driver's
licenses most I've

610
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,970
them say that okay

611
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,970
let's let's not talk not give any names
don't worry

612
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,870
let's let's not talk about a fake ID is
by the way anybody who wants to come to

613
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,549
the key signing party tomorrow it's at
one o'clock in the workshop area

614
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:25,740
I yeah anyways I'm psychic

615
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:30,060
but anyway what i'm saying is that these
things do definitely exists and that

616
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,060
that's exactly the final name can be
forced just like a handoff

617
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,430
you can impersonate someone else that is
exactly the point I'm trying to make

618
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:45,430
thank you

619
00:39:50,259 --> 00:39:53,299
I think it

620
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:59,060
has gone miles

621
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,759
I think this is a record about 17
minutes left so

622
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:08,880
well let Steve know the key sign parties
are different than the signing

623
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,160
someone like a manual the signing of
somebody talk conference

624
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,069
because the rules and key signing

625
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:19,270
signed strange situation you're saying
strangers keys

626
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:22,410
which is a different design this guy is
a point I'm trying to use the

627
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,470
than 90 signing I can sign then you can
have more than one

628
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,609
trust the point I'm trying to make is
that

629
00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:33,130
this is a function of social networking

630
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:37,380
hands key signing party is not are in
artificial construct

631
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,170
within that where things like photo ID
in whatever are

632
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,490
are introduced as a way of handling
situations where you don't know

633
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,609
percent by people are taking it too far

634
00:40:48,609 --> 00:40:52,310
they're saying things like I will not
sign your key

635
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:55,420
even if I've known you for the last
twenty years

636
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,839
unless you produce photo ID and i'm
saying that is completely unnecessary

637
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:03,270
because the key identity finding is
there for you and you alone

638
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:06,839
other people don't like it more than
they can just not sign K

639
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,020
by if if I came up with a new key and I
handed you the private key

640
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,569
I ask you to sign it I went with you for
a year

641
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:19,430
would you ask me to see my driver's
license before signing the K

642
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,640
I don't think you and one of these
people are starting to say well we're

643
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,549
security professionals

644
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,720
this is proper operating procedure we
need to do this

645
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,250
and it is causing a lot of problems
unnecessary

646
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:38,299
exclusion of people from the love trust
and problems in certain situations

647
00:41:38,299 --> 00:41:42,259
when is nine individual are behind the
key

648
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:48,060
so thats that's the point

649
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:53,000
up I think these people are supporting

650
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,589
cell are there any you wanna

651
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:01,299
and anything find actually I'm just
thinking that were mourned agreement

652
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:05,259
24 hours ago problem if anything

653
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:10,100
so going back and slides a person only
has one unique identity

654
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,040
I was gonna skip to these really quickly
they're not gonna be as funny as they

655
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,670
were in germany

656
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,080
unfortunately arm

657
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,880
we've already covered pseudonyms so on

658
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,740
yeah you know when you signed her to a
probably not

659
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:29,540
we signed her key maybe

660
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,839
when you signed her key you wish

661
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,270
you know its it's all a matter of key

662
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:40,370
to the identity finding Knoxy to name
not

663
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:45,819
not to even situation it's just you're
sending messages to that guy or in that

664
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:46,600
case that

665
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:50,620
check that manual was going on and on
about about how she came to 2600 meeting

666
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,589
so

667
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:55,380
Nash has been mentioned twice at the
conference she should be actually no

668
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:58,850
speaker next time something

669
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,960
side lol on

670
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,609
it's just a matter of figuring out what
you accept

671
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:11,390
as a name or are you really going for an
area Denmark

672
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:16,000
here's the serious example there's
anybody in this room know who security

673
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,470
dash

674
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:23,470
officer at noon PST .org is other than
miles

675
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,410
those war yes

676
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,520
because what what if this person

677
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,250
or this key who has 24 signatures was
signed three other keys

678
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,569
who is only three cup three hops from
Mikey what if this is a team

679
00:43:39,569 --> 00:43:44,150
20 people and one of them has signed the
key in the other nineteen are ignorant

680
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:51,150
about fact

681
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,690
the I don't even need to know if it's an
individual it's a role

682
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,799
if there's a plugin that PST to need to
report to am

683
00:43:57,799 --> 00:44:01,190
reporting it to the role of the security
officer and I don't care whether it's

684
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,589
one or twenty people

685
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:06,690
okay but but the proof on

686
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:10,130
the for her ownership

687
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,430
here is tricky because what if one
person leaves on bad terms

688
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,049
and they say well we'll just change the
pass phrase on the key and that person

689
00:44:18,049 --> 00:44:21,299
Reeves on bad terms says I'm gonna Wiese

690
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:24,430
way the next copy of Windows signed by
the NetBSD

691
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,009
accusing missus NetBSD 3.0 of the future

692
00:44:28,009 --> 00:44:32,380
if net P if NetBSD people

693
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,140
are handing out private key to everybody
and thinking that eating a pass rates

694
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,240
will actually protect Turkey then I
think on that because the project to

695
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:39,960
disband

696
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,100
what the talk I gave in Germany arms
there was somebody from Sweden there

697
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,710
who said we were talking about
government are keys in a corporation

698
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,180
and he was of the opinion that if
somebody was

699
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,450
fired from their jobs the key for the
corporation should change

700
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,230
and I said I don't thanks are not he
said that should change

701
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,910
I so that it should he said well why
should you change the key

702
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,170
because of one person you're not
changing the role it's just one person

703
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:09,710
cycling through

704
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:14,880
and my my statement is you know if one
person and some bad turns you can't just

705
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,580
change the passphrase make everything
okay

706
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,779
and if one person leaves from that the
st. on bad terms

707
00:45:20,779 --> 00:45:24,430
do you think they're gonna cycle the
entire key or not they might

708
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:30,440
I N and Chan chances are NetBSD probably
well but this company in Sweden

709
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,970
and heels and people should know how to
use like a master key and

710
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:38,100
have people signed up to have to master
key sign in to be two people and

711
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,290
you can provoke in for two people and
they'll even into two people can sign

712
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:48,440
releases for that right but how do you
know that this is actually the case

713
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,589
Dean do Russell what that's the other
problem if if I see this email address

714
00:45:52,589 --> 00:45:55,720
on their website I have to trust that
their website snowpack at other things

715
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,109
in a

716
00:45:56,109 --> 00:46:00,330
not no there yes are dead that the
signatures of this key are okay

717
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,520
its Upton at BSC in this example to
solve the problem

718
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:10,520
what i'm saying is I don't think they
will offers prop

719
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,279
sir I

720
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:21,940
diseases this is the relationship
between my key and

721
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,619
NetBSD arm photo ID can always trust a
photo ID

722
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:30,770
I guess is a good thing because I'm the
first person to tell me what's wrong

723
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:34,170
with this idea and I don't give a shit
about the expiration day

724
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,710
by the first person I can tell you
what's wrong with society gets free

725
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,089
t-shirt

726
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:43,509
I

727
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,970
alright who says that

728
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:52,589
said that about to tee shirts

729
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:56,390
what is wrong with this ID of

730
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:01,060
did just shouted out it's not the eye
color

731
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:08,060
it's not that she's smiling what is
wrong with this idea

732
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:19,069
Eddie I told you the exploration doesn't
matter what is wrong with this idea

733
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:23,500
here

734
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,080
she's pretty after a four year old

735
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,910
sorry what about her name

736
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,740
have a t-shirt so the fit this

737
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:41,640
picture I found on my mom doing in
Google Images search for fake ID

738
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,690
this is a post on her blog saying I
can't believe this I D got me

739
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:49,279
into clubs all the time

740
00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:53,400
because they fucked up my last name her
last name is Wayne

741
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:00,080
and the amp review I area

742
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:05,859
so this this is a problem that I have
with people who rely on

743
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:10,759
government-issued photo ID is um

744
00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:15,290
you are placing trust arbitrarily on a
third party that is not necessarily to

745
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:16,299
be trusted

746
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:19,940
and water security professionals swear
by this method

747
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,630
they will not sign your see unless they
see a driver's license

748
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:27,640
or passport even if its you know that I
was reading up on this

749
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:31,350
while ago and some be mentioned a
Tasmanian passport

750
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:35,420
and despite the fact that there are no
Tasmanian passports now you have an

751
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,310
Australian

752
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:39,400
for are

753
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,410
if people if people see something that
looks vaguely official

754
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:47,330
then no go okay and smile and nod and
it's all good

755
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,200
are why are you placing trust and
third-party

756
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,850
arbitrarily when you won't trust social
networking

757
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:58,490
way recognizing somebody's name Mike I
put up a picture of a man you're never

758
00:48:58,490 --> 00:48:59,170
really goes

759
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:03,920
hey that's manual goldstein on this is
one the main point I'm trying to make

760
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,930
I the trusting love verifying somebody's

761
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:11,250
identity is up to you and you alone and
doesn't matter whether they have a piece

762
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,819
of plastic with some

763
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:16,839
crappy holograms laid over for an extra
ten dollars on Canal Street

764
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:20,739
or whether they are no just

765
00:49:20,739 --> 00:49:24,109
you have to make this decision for
yourself and the piece a plastic

766
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:27,859
isn't gonna or shouldn't help you make
that decision for yourself

767
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:32,350
over knowing somebody in person or by
reputation

768
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,180
time

769
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,940
on if anything and I just like to add to
that the I mean most service in this

770
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,569
rumor

771
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:43,700
hackers an inherently we distrust

772
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,600
government agencies so why would we
trust government agencies to

773
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,480
ensure the identification of other
hackers and after all

774
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,480
who is it except other hackers they're
using PGP

775
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:04,119
alright so I guess because I'm just
about out of time

776
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:07,319
I'm not going and finish to talk but I
would like to a

777
00:50:07,319 --> 00:50:13,170
show the the parallels are identity
identity verification through photo ID

778
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,710
this is somebody who should be fairly

779
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,330
well-known or just just another average
person

780
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:23,489
you know she's kinda cute maybe I guess

781
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:26,989
by now people I

782
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:30,270
with it with a bag over her head

783
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:35,700
here's her ID her name is fire appears
shows on 160 Madison Avenue in Baltimore

784
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,410
please ignore the rotten dot com you are
out on the bottom right

785
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:43,930
arm a photo ID gives out many details a
lot of hackers did not want to show

786
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:45,560
photo ID because

787
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,859
they don't want their docs drops they
don't want people to know what their

788
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:50,339
real name is or who they were

789
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:54,810
or where they live I'm so they will not
show photo ID for that reason

790
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:57,900
nabi insistent on using handle instead

791
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,950
and a photo ID will never have

792
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,009
more usually won't have with certain
exceptions

793
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:07,630
are the same handle that people go about
icons like this

794
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:13,759
South wide is this woman look familiar

795
00:51:13,759 --> 00:51:20,440
yeah sure here's a picture of her dad
arm

796
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,100
so that's her photo ID

797
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,150
that so far is this matchup

798
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:35,630
now now it got her into bars

799
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,480
hands with with secret service escort we
went with her secret service escort

800
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,790
fight it did get her into bars or
supposedly got into bars

801
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:52,180

know her personal a

802
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:59,180

803
00:52:04,799 --> 00:52:11,650

804
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:17,089
can you repeat and microphone

805
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:21,910
under federal statute um these secret
service is the only federal agency that

806
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:23,140
is allowed

807
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,259
to one one so they're not allowed to

808
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,980
break the law on this case and say that
she is to the ID says he is but the same

809
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,829
time they're not allowed to use their

810
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:37,920
authority to enter a place or to force
the client entry into place

811

they're authorizing some kinda warrant

812
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:42,799
for

813
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:46,009
your suspect there's a crime going on
for the fear for the safety things

814
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,940
so that they're not they're not
specifically allowed to do anything
