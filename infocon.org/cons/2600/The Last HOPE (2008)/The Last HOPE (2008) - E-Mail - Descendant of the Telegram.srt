00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,350
I ask for a they approved it so must be

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:45,760
my area code right but I share so let's
all go back in fines

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,260
a message that that I did

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:57,260
simes my regular signature tag to Gugu
Gugu Gugu

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,640
UGG UGG

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,670
I actually have that as a sound on my

15
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,610

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,469
are usually to eBay Pay Pal and my bank

19
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:24,020
fishing now from other banks to worry
about but from my bank

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,539
I want my bank protected so I for them

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,930
explaining that should the bar you know
first I cut out the header information

22
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,630
that doesn't always go with

23
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,149
before you catchment a pace that in but

24
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:44,149
tell you what I am let me find one that
I've sent

25
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,030
mmm

26
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:02,030
shouldn't take too long

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:15,300
your bank account for forward yes do

28
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,679
so high there Martin yes well

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,490
you do but attach is a fitting as I
recently received

30
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,980
are you notice that my signature is
indented the five spaces

31
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,149
then I in than five bass and put the the
closing

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,750
parentheses as a Cheshire smile then

33
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:41,170
you know Richard Cheshire comma hacker
never I'm coming from

34
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,980
but then I give me address the Cheshire
Cat com slash perspective dot HTML

35
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,709
that's why is my introduction which
asked the question

36
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,770
just who is this guy they have a clue

37
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,840
remember no one's clothes you give them
clues

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,010
so then I go

39
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,820
equal sign equal sign be begin included
text

40
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,450
and I include the header of the messages
I copied it out

41
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,290
and then another clue for them and if
included text

42
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,310
and this is how I will include something
that

43
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,000
since it's only a textual email I have
to give them clues as to what

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,680
is the part I'm cutting out and
something to you and then below that is

45
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,000
the actual for reading via yahoo mail

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,870
the message I got verify your account
information blah blah blah

47
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,810
and of course we put the cursor on the
link the verifier online banking access

48
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,160
we can see well if we go to view

49
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,850
status bar and then hover over

50
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,769
we can see the bottom that's going to
angel PAF .jp slash uploads less blah

51
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,450
blah blah slash bankamerica complex
bankamerica

52
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,380
so euro is put in there but as a
directory name and

53
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,010
there are those cool you know just see
almost got back american they're a good

54
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,899
look at the click

55
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,070
and no I'm not going to click it even
now

56
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,220
because you don't Kurdish people

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,080
so

58
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,560
back to the topic that will go

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,370
even further but other point I'm making
is that people don't understand

60
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,280
a message comes on paper had an
origination

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,430
were some one side the message now why
am i harping on

62
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,740
their as I said before a ham radio
operator

63
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,300
when I work ham radios in homestead
florida

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,120
after hurricane andrew hasn't got much
better since then I can tell you

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,240
working since then we found we said up
into the EEOC

66
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,370
emergency operation center this problem
on

67
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,780
paper and hang them into the pit now the
pit

68
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,240
other Emergency Operations Center is
where all the yourselves are arco

69
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,710
located there are deaths

70
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,729
semi-circle around the podium reamers
manager

71
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,320
usually stance and book

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,390
the essa the emergency service functions

73
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,060
um yes

74
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,640
one is transportation reopen those roads

75
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,740
yourself to is communications and hang
out

76
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,510
I'll yourself three there's there's
police there's fire

77
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,919
there's mass feeding mask here some

78
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,859
only got about USF-sixteen for his
yourself 17

79
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,400
offer animal care they found out that
you know all these horses and dogs and

80
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,830
our cats running loose they had with
that too so they have their own

81
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,250
yes EPP your service function we will
send a message

82
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,510
into the EEOC you get handed off into
the pit

83
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:47,320
and had to say I would patrol Highway
Patrol that have good

84
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,880
down their chain of command verify the
information

85
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,210
get that back up and then they would
dispatch assistance

86
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,739
they didn't understand the concept a
message

87
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,020
had someone who sent it and usually

88
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,560
through the hymns we will verify was
sent by that person

89
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,810
you asking for signature because that's
how our messages are

90
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,400
handle we have the tradition message
traffic gambling love our guys for him

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,740
produce some work for what Telegraph
Company

92
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,020
yeah we need the procedures you'll find

93
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,030
after an emergency him a particular
credit for

94
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,010
for doing a lot of things with
communications it's because we know what

95
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,520
we're doing

96
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,310
we train ourselves on it we are a while
by the federal government

97
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,919
to play with radios on our own specific
radio frequencies

98
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:40,030
and weather is an emergency we're happy
to help out

99
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:43,060
return for allowing us to play with
those radios

100
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,960
frequencies because radios can cross
national borders

101
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,400
it has been decided that national
governments must

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,200
license transmitters now there are some
governments don't what

103
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,620
people as many things across national
borders but

104
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,830
for places like the US where it's a
while this is simply regulated

105
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,849
loosely regulated and in the hand
community self-regulated

106
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,570
um and we do our part we help out a lot

107
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,790
%uh what the radio arch came from ham
radio

108
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,000
people who play stuff I'd lose a the
reason I got my cam license

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,150
is difficult packet radio data
communications

110
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,350
over ham radio when somebody for said
about

111
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,850
bacteria what that was that
communication overhead

112
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,949
watch data como that I i cant play with

113
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:36,400
wears those Morse code tapes after
twenty years of listening to short wave

114
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,190
radio

115
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,290
BBC World Service retook international
organic

116
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,820
I finally broke down learned Morse code
got my ham turkey

117
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,190
and six months later they do we have the
most requirement for the

118
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,240
that's okay limit that more by computed
the game

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,900
now I was limited because didn't have go
to 15 acres

120
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,470
above the VHF range that meant I could

121
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:03,350
only play with things like all space
satellites

122
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,980
yeah right restricted no problem

123
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,290
I for ten years later by the breakdown
and of my general

124
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:17,000
but a I saw the coverage is a plywood
but I do play HF once you're fine lucky

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,430
twice your not the 12 years on him but
you feel they when are you

126
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,530
goes up picked up three do's so sup in a
prepared field

127
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,360
background and for 24-hour period we
tried

128
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,400
stations if I'm not lucky there's a
hurricane or something

129
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,578
have got a red cross shelter and radios
and

130
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:39,520
you know use HF VHF whatever's available
get the word out

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,338
my adventures are on the Internet for
working Andrew

132
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:47,320
and we can time

133
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,390
but the concept get the message through
and that it does come from somebody who

134
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,400
signed off in that message

135
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,040
is real concept that people needs a the
deal with

136
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,670
I'm other any questions

137
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:08,670
you yes

138
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,300
well first of with ham radio

139
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,810
if you're going to send a message via
ham radio via ham operator

140
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,690
you are gonna put something on paper he
handed off to him because

141
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,190
in our tradition we simply copy what
you've put down

142
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:31,230
now all sides shelter say

143
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:35,370
with the 50 cops and you know will wait
out the message

144
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,800
and we will sign it with the signature
up the shelter manager

145
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,540
up but he gave us instructions and the
message

146
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,620
so we can put down a singer that he said
so

147
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,360
and that message signature means he said
so it was a message into

148
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,930
across headquarters by the EEOC you know

149
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,410
couple hours later on the cot up
interesting thing too is

150
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,329
usually when you put in a request for
supplies some kind the ready room

151
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,620
never hears back but step shows up hours
later

152
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,040
you know ever since the announcement
that they got the message or anything

153
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,579
else

154
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:13,220
but stop those job eventually just

155
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,269
something that happened to notice you

156
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:24,269
other yes

157
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,680
huh

158
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:58,170
yes

159
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,960
from Toronto I don't think would provide
from

160
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,960
the US

161
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,930
well the trick with telegrams the
question being

162
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,400
that you know a joint committees

163
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,210
all telegrams of the webpage a examples

164
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:27,710
and at the local office they may have
more information about the origination

165
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:31,590
up because you need to be able to trace
back telegram if need be

166
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,120
but use what goes to the customer isn't
doesn't have all the information just

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,780
enough people look up in the book

168
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,780
introspective last realization came from

169
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:53,209
yes oh that if there's a stroke could
trace it back I'm trying to repeat for

170
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,529
the

171
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:57,560
ready audience ur a thing there is that

172
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,750
in the bad old days the Telegraph you
didn't have a whole other room

173
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,690
for a long white have message headers in
the Internet age

174
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,320
just another wine with another host
routing that

175
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,450
a message passed through an Evo your
complete

176
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:17,820
Brokeback but you just have affected
last releases you supposed to keep

177
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,410
records

178
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,000
%uh the previous realization the
conference a good race back that way

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,310
very labor intensive process trees back
a message like that and in the Internet

180
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:27,980
age is just

181
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm a sitter in fact on packet radio

182
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,200
messages by the way I should at that
packet radio

183
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,240
we still to this day have computer
bulletin board systems

184
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,360
call packable court systems you can't
send

185
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,130
email from you ever to review our reader
via computers

186
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,089
over the radio you can

187
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:53,400
done for board %uh

188
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,640
the air raid its a bit rate

189
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,310
a the use arbitrators 1200 baud

190
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,630
and other are ninety border

191
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,400
winks between network nodes

192
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,690
and this may seem slow by today's
standards

193
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:14,600
but you're fine that we have you think
slow is better than that stop

194
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,940
where at least getting the message
through and I for my mother

195
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,530
never worry about me during a hurricane
I'll be in a safe warm

196
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:30,530
Red Cross shelter working much traffic
yes

197
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,550
my thoughts on text messaging being
would that be descended from telegrams

198
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,470
a text messaging being direct User to
User Communications

199
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,029
does not need formal trace backs and

200
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:59,380
there was mention that I use you pock
Upoc dot com

201
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,630
which really stood for universal point
of contact with no just initials lost in

202
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,480
the mists of time

203
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,269
and user 2600 Jimmy

204
00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:11,250
Cheshire 2600 you park anyone wants to
UK with me that way

205
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,980
a good

206
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,720
the text messaging

207
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,269
I found by the way in hurricane
situations I was in Port Charlotte

208
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:28,470
following Hurricane Charley and I found
that while voice calls could not go out

209
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:33,490
over the cell towers SMS messages
written as a service messages

210
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,130
text messages we're getting through so
what was banned with

211
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,230
limited to only 160 characters but it's
amazing how much impact that you need

212
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,500
you

213
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,050
a course we had a radio as we can
informal massive traffic

214
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,290
that way as well but for someone who's
traffic disaster area F revenge

215
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,439
prior text messaging %uh there's a time
to chance it may still work

216
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,020
okay you have some extra time

217
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,510

231
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,600

you see it I can even after my codes

238
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:32,860
on the screen of course why they let me
send SMS text messages I have a

239
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,079
very large text misting package on my my

240
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,630
mobile phone I would use the term mobile
phone by the way not cell phone

241
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,939
a sailor is the technology in use

242
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,839

pet peeves is when people say it eight

243
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:48,589
hundred-number

244
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,350
no toll-free number please get into the
habit people

245
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,360
because there's eight hundred it'd H

246
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,670
877 866 855 and the others are on their
way

247
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,899
so they are toll-free numbers

248
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,579
catcher friends at its you can always
member better in front for somebody else

as clicking on buy flocked dot com 400
right now

311
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,560
but your most this was still the
unofficial race results

312
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,760
because I haven't updated usually with
all the following race

313
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,480
known to put up the unofficial results I
go back and delete those letters

314
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,340
UN for unofficial becomes the web
address for the official results

315
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,560
so you know I just do this when I can

316
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,659
and furthermore all I have to do

317
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,250
but see view page source

318
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:21,560
and come on down here always

319
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,409
what you'll find is all future races

320
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,940
remarked out this means

321
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,540
that on my Treo 650 cell phone I can use
the FTP application the File Transfer

322
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,280
Protocol application have downloaded

323
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,450
i cant download my webpage edited

324
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:46,540
on the phone and put it back up on the
web usually from my local bar where much

325
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,149
in the race

326
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,710
I love getting

327
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,770
the results up on my website before Jay
C dot com

328
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,600
sent me the text message with results
and

329
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,650
its is just an ego thing with neon
amenable to that doesn't really mean

330
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,490
anything

331
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,980
I doubt it was really watching but is a
fun thing to do

332
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:10,440
abut you'll notice

333
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,840

I i've links to their stuff I swipe
their graphics

335
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,240

Association get funding for the river

417
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,330
Cultural Alliance

418
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,870
and from the Space Coast officer tourism

419
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,399
my good friend Bonnie came bunny King
hates my guts

420
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,120
funny King the head to the Brevard
County Tourist Bureau

421
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,409
once my phone number really bad

422
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:33,210
you

423
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,200
that's okay there's no reason to bother
her but it is on the website

424
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,580
at museums are provided at work sorry I

425
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:46,600
bid for the social engineering battle
you wilbert you and perhaps

426
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,610
but I had fun coming up with this in the
concept evolved in the graphics and the

427
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:51,080
text

428
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,639
the people like it the harbor was for
people with punter monday I think about

429
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:57,919
the party room showed what I can do that
visit

430
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,289
the difficult how's it 00 K was it an
extra field there with them

431
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,440
do columns been to and putting them as
they wanted

432
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,260
so what stop think about it you can
forgive her how to get things done

433
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,789
well thats have gratitude anyone I'm

434
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:17,950
but the message to the advertisers is
what's the problem with something up in

435
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,110
an alternate non flash site but you're
going for the flash okay

436
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,730
so you get the bill more because its
costs more to create the flash

437
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,799
you get the bill more because you need
have your hardwood created

438
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,990
you even have your harbor just short to
the CEO

439
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:34,440
yellow replace his whole computer system
you can show on

440
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,429
what do sewing up well without depending
on

441
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:42,440
you know 12 they're gonna have with all
the high end graphics and you know but

442
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,690
the thing is that they get the

443
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,450
to poles and other buildings you know
what you can bill for a text-based

444
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,600
site as well and for a just plain

445
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,679
Jaipur graphics site we have that little

446
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,399

the thing is it's not that hard it can
be done

451
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,419
we're just not doing it and

452
00:29:19,419 --> 00:29:22,500
