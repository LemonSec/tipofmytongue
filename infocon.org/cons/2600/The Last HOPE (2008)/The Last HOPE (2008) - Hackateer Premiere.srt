thanks for guys coming out today this is
om the hack into your premier

2
00:00:03,979 --> 00:00:07,069
and I thought I would just start with
just a few brief words about

3
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:10,809

it's called on package here a follows
the adventures of

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,230
3 hackers who show you how to hack

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,120
or build cool tech things way they don't
just leave it there

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,340
been a go I'll and show you how to use
it in the real world all by

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,360
while being chased by a quasi-government
agency

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,589
who is on basically out to kill arm

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,690
in the processor to show armed is
actually

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,269
other elements such as on they into they
actually interview

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,230
so many top tech people around the world
as well as some

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,540
various hackers who also llame some Adam

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,879
I don't know maybe I used to hack with
the go to jail with them that sort of

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,180
thing

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,470
so are I myself use to be a hacker
writes to

17
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,649
brake systems and Om I'm gonna show you
a little bit about it and then afterward

18
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:00,040
um

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,589
I'll take some questions in will talk
about a little bit and then maybe I'll

20
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,030
even

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,340
I could be goaded into drinking this

here

69
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,930
this kid looks at the floor

70
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,039
star next on the list by tough get going

71
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:59,370
the retard you back up draft

72
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,370
scandalous

73
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,919
this

74
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,430
doris was DC

75
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,300
have to cheat is all about to nineteen
year that

76
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,900
information about technology should be
accessible to anyone who wants access to

77
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,420
it

78
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,590
anyone who believes that they can take
that technology and use it for

79
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,670
song positive gold are

80
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:37,510
is a hacker and this activity is act why
the nom de plume the fiber optic

81
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,090
when I first shows that handles
fiber-optic is an up-and-coming

82
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,530
technology

83
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,090
most people have never heard about and
that's all I saw myself as

84
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,870
representing something that was on the
cost on the cutting edge

85
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,780
saying goes you he had killed or
certainly others

86
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,250
bardo I'm I would definitely consider
myself among them

87
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,290
how do you today group good photograph
acting as a skill that can be used for

88
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,340
good or bad

89
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,260
and it really depends on the end the
intentions and motivations of the person

90
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,289
who uses the skills

91
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,030
is there is something there I K what do
you think a bit

92
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,840
there were those of us who adhered to

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,190
hire Essex I'll once we

94
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,020
identified what our skills were and

95
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,580
that the d come with and obvious amount
of responsibility given rio happy

96
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,419
I mean DJ stuff not the namby-pamby
Ponciano

97
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,380
I defaced the website for the native
texting pound is know but the real

98
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,920
of cool stuff real as in the legal

99
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:50,950
good my this heat the thing to remember
is early on when we first started and

100
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,320
gaining access to systems that we're not
ours

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,090
this type of activity was not be legal
there were no specific

102
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,180
computer crime laws per se in your
experience

103
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,310
what country has the best security I can
easily say from personal experience with

104
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,680
where security is and that's probably it
in

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,570
Asia Western Europe certainly a lot more
chance to become security

106
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:17,370
and in a perfect world it would be nice
if in the US we could have

107
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,880
hackers and other media reporting on

108
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,870
a security threats as well as security
organizations and the government

109
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,550
are all taking part in securing the
country

110
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,010
protecting its citizens from
technological threats

111
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:40,020
I am on Tues what are the easiest kinds
of companies to hack

112
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,240
i've seen. security flaws in

113
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,330
many different types accompanies I
wouldn't say it was really restricted

114
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,440
to any one particular type consistent
you like

115
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,990
in the past one of the most favorite
things to act is probably the telephone

116
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:55,570
network

117
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,490
your phone systems always so far ahead
as far as technology when Bell

118
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,540
Laboratories

119
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,250
a and in the past historically they've
come out with some other

120
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,270
some the biggest breakthroughs in and in
scientific history

121
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,190
you have no but object guess about them
project MF

122
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:19,640
project mother fucker thats project for
me event actually refers to the

123
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,580
multi-frequency tones

124
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,880
that up were used to signal between
switches

125
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,300
on the old telephone network I thought
it would be a really great idea if I

126
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,300
could create some kinda simulation

127
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,370
I'll whereby someone would be able to
blue box

128
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,760
again and they would also allow our
entire

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,919
new generation of hackers who phone
phreaks or even know its history books

130
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,110
to be able to experience what it was
like to actually engage in this activity

131
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,310
Deek says the 18th-minute

132
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,530
bit naughty and given the NASA access to
conduct

133
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,300
illegal wiretaps because it just is

134
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,550
wasn't exactly hah super please do and
when I heard that AT&T was taking over

135
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,910
see you

136
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:08,719
who loves my current provider
interestingly enough

137
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,589
the my phone is exclusively on the
network quiet is the

138
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:16,470
kid want to listen in on the sleaziest

139
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,210
mom broke her nose bleeds

140
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:25,400
how do you think I don't know if I
believe it to be a conspiracy and if it

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,290
is a conspiracy it was it conspiracy
between

142
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,890
sit between Apple and AT&T we now saying
that

143
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,079
but Apple is also cooperating with the
government

144
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:38,400
do on their own we keep me get paid

145
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,490
to think of some kind of big shit

146
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,839
I certainly didn't have the page up for
myself someone else did

147
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,280
so long I guess I'm other then and there

148
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,970
certainly people far less importance and
Wikipedia

149
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,120
you're doing any doing that now

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,530
what time the Hawks the good stuff

151
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,709
goes on acts home speak a

152
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,020
really you know one could say I hacks
for a living

153
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,140
I days %uh mean on occasion

154
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,800
if I am doing security type job

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,490
I like 20 do a lot more security
architecture but prefer to

156
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,459
design things in a secure manner rather
than being called in to do a security

157
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:26,690
review

158
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,020
and take away all the things I see that
other people have done wrong

159
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,459
what do you do with you million or
hacking I certainly enjoy the

160
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,550
music various kinds I

161
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,250

196
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:01,569
do cool thank you guys are too kind to
crime

197
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm so just a little bit about the
series

198
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,520
what is it about is to endeavor to make
a a series that

199
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,490
really does multiple things right one of
the hardest things is how do you do when

200
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,890
i hack issues there

201
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:21,270
really really arm Inc actually see
experience you know

202
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:25,430
I myself used to be like more systems
break ice to break into computers

203
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,790
an arm I can talk about it since I
actually arm

204
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:33,490
I summits this certain crimes I did that
are in the public domain so I love

205
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,810
arm we stacked you know I'm you work you
do it

206
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,860
%um did time for but wanted things is
you know we broke systems

207
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,920
you know arm three-letter agencies

208
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,580
arm I remember in particular wanted the

209
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,130
did network someone was in the a.m day
the the NSA

210
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,240
NSA was hitting on this network that we
got access to

211
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,240
it was a listed as a Fishing Company

212
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,750
because the the the whole system was
dock master but was listed as efficient

213
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,960
company but we thought it was

214
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,900
hide their generals will logging into a
Fishing Company like I I know they have

215
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,630
varied interests and %uh sure enough we
looked in in X you know in SA

216
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:17,790
Jim so arm s illogical

217
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,699
force with us actually no actually the
truth is that I'm hacking government

218
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,400
agencies

219
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,520
day never fuckin no you hack like a
school

220
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,880
I don't know the the guy who's there who
like to handle it. is like a gap to get

221
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,610
these guys but like the government
didn't they never know

222
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,730
all the time banks no by Tom you know

223
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,510
soul um what I thought was like I liked
it casually somebody's

224
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:45,260
these arm stories dat dat acted like a
sore foot it

225
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,980
a agency right and arm

226
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,540
one-time there was a system day we
wanted to

227
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,790
had to had to get this system in my head
to prove something

228
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,189
soul I couldn't get dick cook for some
reason

229
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,510
I couldn't give you money system really
frustrate no

230
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,730
the problem was I could give you an play
the guy was on a system 24 hours a day

231
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,420
slide

232
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,630
did was no window to do what I had to do
so what I did was out I

233
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,660
I I shoot into a into a

234
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,060
a check to email and notice that there
was a female employee there

235
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,150
who he liked and had a question Sony

236
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,900
issued as the user an arm I chatted to
him

237
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,940
over series at Days Inn you know
convinced him that I was you know

238
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,340
interested in him

239
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:37,690
you know and hmm him and they used to
say I mean you know this is

240
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:40,920
you know this is for the craft of course
I am

241
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,140
ALM I was able to arm

242
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,510
you know get him to mas to me check

243
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,430
on UNIX and resisting good

244
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,550
I

245
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,400
already shadow debut Sony like but the
point is that like there was this

246
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,450
all the stories from from years ago

247
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,170
over ok sorta breaking computer using
the next phase

248
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,680
working for detective agencies and stuff
you know

249
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,420
should have you had some friends that
work for for ramp and I was a

250
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,800
talking right they actually talk over
excellent or arm

251
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,169
arm and you know I'm us over for
detective agency so

252
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:27,770
but the point is no that arm wanted to
find a way to bring Ballack

253
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,820
in like you know you've seen movies like
home what was it actually likes what

254
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,460
fish

255
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,040
but you know it's a lot of bullshit like
they go in the person goes ain't and it

256
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,330
like

257
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,159
this is just not a computer with 10
screens Knoll

258
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,240
it has all c3 uplink in its like
basketball shit like you notice

259
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,390
I remember anybody he remembered he said
tell you like all if you

260
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,180
I've got in ninety six thousand board
modem you only have a 2400 baud modem

261
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:58,290
you sup dude you gonna get corn acres
yeah i hack faster at 96 buoyed like I

262
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,680
was like total bullshit

263
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,300
but actually I'm I'd I think I did that
did kinda

264
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,850
you know what I said you was arm I would
I had a

265
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:11,550
I start hacking on a Commodore 64 right
so I didn't really have like a buffer

266
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,560
percent so what I would do is at hooker
VCR up to the

267
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,590
to television so I which is kak like

268
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:22,199
every file on the system and I would
issue the remote to go through it

269
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,180
looking for a

270
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,940
past I do your sysadmin

271
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,300
so like that would be my thing but I
figured you know lish

272
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,220
let me take that and put that into a
series and then also to like a lot of

273
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:35,750
times

274
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,880
you go to talk soon you see these tech
guys in degrade

275
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,860
need demonstrative when you're talking
to them one-on-one is so passionate

276
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,020
and when you see him in an interview day
life done

277
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,220
because the interview it usually doesn't
even know what to ask him about

278
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,240
acting like a plan taxer arm arm

279
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,300
we have a fixer in another episode

280
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,510
and Dom I'm playing an axe kevin Mitnick

281
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,870
to be in it we should be tough cuz I
know some things about Kevin

282
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,170
I don't think he wants you to know fact
on the hacker day's play

283
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,620
that would be a great interview for him
to take part here

284
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,220
arm arm so one other things too is that

285
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,110
the other English 0 is too sore to get
young people involved

286
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,660
in technology and also also did not
necessarily

287
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,100
like 10 done already hacking always
ignore the hacking but nobody hacking

288
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,700
their system penetration stuff i mean

289
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,470
you know that stuff school if you really
wanna live on the outside edge

290
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,970
there will be people do that but there's
a lot of you know positive things you

291
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,670
can do both coding

292
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,060
not really defacing website some
actually really down I think as you can

293
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,280
tell from watching this year

294
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,389
soul so you know is just I'm sorry it's
a personal thing but

295
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,500
arm the fact remains that a you know
this so much that could be done so the

296
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:52,950
show

297
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,290
so did tell show you how to build
different things some other stuff

298
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,909
II pick Tom arm LED graph mags which is
really LED

299
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:04,320
dougie's an actual young Graffiti
Research Lab

300
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,639
is that the team behind that anyone's
that developed a but we have some unique

301
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
ones we show you

302
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,980
arm out a bill like a uploading video
camera lessen the back to your car and

303
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,200
it goes up

304
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,130
and stuff so you can see traffic all the
way down shows you arm

305
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:22,940
are many show shows you different things
like for instance they threw the graph

306
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,950
max but then

307
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,020
you know he fires it from basically arm

308
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,080
oMG ever seen a spike jones anybody for
me was bygones

309
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,330
social teach you how to build it but a
much cleaner one week

310
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,740
you know delighted trigger an end day
actually built like a remote trigger for

311
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,160
in an email to to the car and use it to
a shoot the Fed

312
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,540
so you know all f.2d really happy way
who knows additionally embellishment but

313
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,210
basically asked her

314
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,390
that's the thrust the up the series and

315
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,170
from that have been yeah in everything
actually works and in

316
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,800
you know in and also to light alum a new
one if things I struggle with light gray

317
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,110
area stuff like

318
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,240
you know like for instance be really
easy to spoof

319
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,860
caller ID on point very easy and is
actually not really a challenge because

320
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,760
the whole

321
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,950
6 specification is there for you to
figure it out

322
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,860
but you can do it really easy you know I
figure we can dramatizing in putting in

323
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,960
the show

324
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,190
rather than necessarily show you how to
do it play if you look carefully

325
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:26,750
it will be there how to do it and on one
other interesting things

326
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,210
to a bowtie is like Dennis like some
interactivity building like for instance

327
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:36,480
there's a scene where um the Michael
palisades the 600-pound man

328
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,510
gives a idea shows a number and actually
if you call that number less like some

329
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,700
Grand Central

330
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,160
being a goes back in you can actually
talk to 12 characters and stuff

331
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,770
so to all be launching on Haggerty Road
acecomm and Om

332
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,129
arm that'll be a it will be real soon so

333
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,370
if I tell you what I'm gonna open the
floor to a few questions if anybody has

334
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,050
any questions

335
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,260
are my guests let me start their

336
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,520
did

337
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,389
arm arm well for some reaction what do
you think would you like to see on

338
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,680
television

339
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,650
where alright good as good I'm

340
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,490
I would like to see on television to
right now arm leaning toward doing it

341
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,320
while I'm only because

342
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,899
the axion do it anyway have actually arm
for living

343
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,230
direct pieces for television you know
little boy

344
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:35,110
to her after job but anyway the point is
that you know you can't really

345
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,850
you need be like all day be nervous you
know somebody's gonna hurt themselves

346
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:39,940
spud guns

347
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,880
they probably worried about LED lights
on me and get all nervous you use our

348
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,140
people talk about

349
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:49,370
you know the shutdown Boston over LED
lights

350
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,960
does you don't play I like to I you know
so right now I'm

351
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm considering doing online that's when
ordinances

352
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,490
this time the little things like the the
episodes run backwards in hex

353
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,929
the number you know the numbering up the
Danes as a whole lot over

354
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:10,310
you know inside jokes related to online
I think that's where things are moving

355
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:14,000
in most people would be interested in a
spin you know it's been mostly a

356
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,110
time-consuming

357
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:19,310
entertain me online and I think I am so
that's really where we want to do it I

358
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,200
am

359
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,510
after materials some television interest
arm but I really

360
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,970
I'm really right now moving to doing it
online

361
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,820
any

362
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,120
for its oh here okay so I'm

363
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,040
I'm I'm I play pain herridge which is on

364
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,360
I'll just so you know anybody who knows
me

365
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,490
knows I had this really minuscule ego
play

366
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,340
the point is no

367
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,730
that I I put myself in a disorder blur
the line like the idea this year

368
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,870
disorder borderline

369
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,759
who's a hacker any who's not you know
all the characters in the BIOS have been

370
00:23:58,759 --> 00:23:59,380
in jail

371
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,240
way who's to say they haven't been in
jail there'll be people in Yahoo actors

372
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,690
in

373
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,029
that you'd be surprised to actually
notorious

374
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,860
international hackers who went broke in
now only banks

375
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:17,909
what governments and brought them to the
enemies nnnn they'll be in there in

376
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:19,130
episode three or four

377
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,190
to look out for star well

378
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,200
arm you know and hopefully no one
currently on the run but thing you know

379
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,570
that arm you know soul I'll but I'm

380
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,418
I'm pain hurts which is obviously like a
little play of

381
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:39,480
you know yet PA si said acid acid
nationally signs

382
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,940
next to the Linux penguin which day do
with the

383
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,460
defeat likes so arm that's what's up so
my character

384
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,940
.0 quite a bit is no my character actor
doesn't say that much

385
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,980
so arm that's how you that I keep my ego
in check

386
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,149
and in the wings so any other questions

387
00:24:57,149 --> 00:25:03,620
see I the actually officials assured

388
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,559
I put this together specifically for
hope to see you can see soil

389
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,629
the breath and I put like that you know
like for instance at

390
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:13,809
n that some hacker called om

391
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,210
yet Chris Goggins Chris kayak

392
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,350
to is debatable whether he is an
informant and I'm what

393
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,620
the point the point being know that arm
you know

394
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,370
this inside joke for people who know
movie is and stuff like that so

395
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:35,289
arm Armin actually I yes oh yes it does
with that one times actually shorter

396
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:39,658
and arm our main and but is like
multiple episodes it'll be narrative

397
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:40,220
elements

398
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,899
and hacker element you know story
element hacker l'ami

399
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:47,179
adventure element and in is a interview
part

400
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:52,549
so is actually a weird hybrid of things
me

401
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:57,789
arm

402
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:01,480
II since I work doing film production
have actors from

403
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,659
who actually have some celebrities were
gonna be in it to like actors you seen

404
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:09,019
and stuff arm year

405
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:12,929
anni like I know a bunch of peeps like
from working in film production and no

406
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:13,740
actors

407
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,379
you know someone only favors you know
some animal waiters

408
00:26:17,379 --> 00:26:20,960
so you know I this year labor would ever
know back

409
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,399
you know I any anybody usually works for
me to get paid

410
00:26:24,399 --> 00:26:27,830
way for the most part though like we're
using

411
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,158
both actors and most most other people
actors and trying to keep the

412
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,269
the universe so the real so I can really
feel

413
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:39,529
Paulding and it's actually a challenge
because the hackers are a little goofy

414
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:43,460
arm as they should be and other people
are so we

415
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,610
they have so much crop it us and yet
issue no transfixed we like widens goofy

416
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,019
guys like totally

417
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:53,740
you know scheme the government I mean
one of the things is when I got busted

418
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,429
arm

419
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:58,460
we had arm we actually knew they were
coming

420
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,940
but you know I did age we were like we
was I gonna go

421
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,289
like most wanted to run away and live my
life like I love my mommy so you know we

422
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:07,010
do stay

423
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,539
wife there is a view way

424
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,940
big deal but that I got on a couple why
I work for a

425
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,330
sixty-minute doing consulting and stuff
like that

426
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,158
follow back and I I would life the same
okay

427
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,669
so arm arm Army Knife

428
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:31,269
was young I was back in the hacker de

429
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,610
so arm I'm here but that's a deal so we
have

430
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,200
you know obviously there's a release
form in all the tax and actually snack

431
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,700
shack

432
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,799
HD all the other thing sheesh shown here

433
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:47,080
at the conference date get on the podium
just was shot in HD DVD

434
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,460
like that mean something like Avery dude
show

435
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,679
HD this thing was demonstratively nashod
on

436
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,110
HD it was shot on a very a cheap camera
but I do film production

437
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,470
I guess is cheating so yes any

438
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:08,470
0

439
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:16,679
which girl which girl who likes in

440
00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:24,649
I was gonna say I would

441
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,480
there

442
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:54,480
good question let me i few days arm

443
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,320
do you do you like when you when you
watch a movie do you like to see the

444
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,679
do you like to see how they made the
movie before they make

445
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:09,680
right will likely say let's take Hellboy
two for instance

446
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,990
would you wanna see them sit with three
hundred would you wanna see

447
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,580
them set it up i likey me personally I i

448
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,110
think day I want to keep the mystery any
but you do need the social network right

449
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,670
i think thats the broader question

450
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:27,809
speaks to the strategy full playing this
online absolutely

451
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:31,020
and we're gonna have other hackers any
but we want to have people

452
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,500
also said me things but this is this is
what it is

453
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,540
wanted interesting twist with gonna have
like for instance

454
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,928
bilby 0 when you see a number in the
show

455
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:44,570
if you call a number and leave a message

456
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,220
the character will actually in the show
pick up his phone listen to his messages

457
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,150
and if you leave a choice message that
interesting now playing in the show

458
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,290
you know Rockstar be like you know line
if you like left a message like screw

459
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:57,639
you

460
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,630
rocks totally suck like you know you
have to tell your friends and I might be

461
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,540
like 10,000 hits right there like wow
you know

462
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,820
yo di Toli put me in a showcause akers
rock star out

463
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,740
to me so we have a bunch of interesting
interactive element

464
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,630
play even though we gonna build a
community around eight I think

465
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,230
for this particular shoulder work I'm
not gonna demystified

466
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,540
think it's important to so to keep the
mystery of what's going on what's real

467
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,290
and what's not

468
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:30,090
you know i mean and and some other stuff
is actually really do cross the line a

469
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:30,660
little bit

470
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,880
so much to chagrin of the actors play

471
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,490
you know but you'll you'll see in the if
you are check it out online when the

472
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,210
when the car chase scene you'll see what
I mean really put them

473
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:48,480
do it for him for that own packets your
dot com

474
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,270
yet I was very a at thank you thank you
for pointing out ahead eat so it's hack

475
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,270
into your Mac com

476
00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:00,679
if you go to and stuff they're gone
they're gone you

477
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,060

478
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,820
okay so used to be a good goalie Jenna

479
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,899
oh you okay cool

480
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,120
he used to be a group called a lesion
adorn they would have batted

481
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,890
hackers ever right

482
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,590
I an hour and a half II has started
hacking

483
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,730
and lotta people %um come from that time
period probably remember

484
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,410
you see Elodie do with text files you
noses paper trail

485
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,080
they were like Giants you know I
wouldn't read about them

486
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,000
how Coolio lesion doing so did you know
I was still hack in and do my thing and

487
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,550
everything learning the ropes

488
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:47,659
and then what happened was arm arm you
know here in New York

489
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:51,210
I started to me a buncha other hackers
who likes or

490
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,350
like more like my added to my Francis I
remember a lot to give an example %ah

491
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,320
get to cuming

492
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,800
again once a queue wink I type in I get
into the team chatman

493
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,960
and I say hey guys anybody know bismarck
use

494
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,410
in it like goldfarb you mean with about
New Kids on the Block

495
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:14,020
any so I still blame or three more to
this day that's why I'm a hacker

496
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:18,150
so indeed in these are women and and
went into on

497
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,750
some like-minded fellows and an arm
there was a huge schism

498
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:26,240
because actually more been a we saw
interviewed in he used to be

499
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,030
in regional doing and it was sort of a
schism so we started like you like yo

500
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:35,490
we put too much thought into like
delicious make you like one letter up

501
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,940
so we just made in OD the mood for

502
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,559
the ultimate hacking group and stuff so
I was actually in another group eight

503
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:43,950
league

504
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:47,580
machine we your way I was right after if

505
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,150
fusion left and I took the USA spot
right go a leg room machine

506
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:57,230
so thousand fewer you okay yes I was a
few a system pack

507
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,650
like us a straight up you know X 25
TCPIP

508
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,450
and course what really got me in trouble
during the war way LD was there were

509
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,970
more headset function on a DMS 100 it
was not like logging into a switch you

510
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,760
put a little trap you get a password

511
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,440
on the set up to promote the Remo
headset and you could lines is a

512
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,419
beautiful thing

513
00:33:16,419 --> 00:33:19,820
and still is highly illegal way

514
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,879
he do it so you know einon is amazing I
me because now I'm

515
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,490
dude I got voy I mean it doesn't take
anything his you don t see

516
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:31,280
p Pakistan simple makes you know you
listening to phone calls

517
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,928
however back pain it was really a
leading to control the switches

518
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:39,610
you know in and the control the entire
hierarchy and I was actually one of the

519
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,990
things we control every

520
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,080
or bach and stuff in actually deserve if

521
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:48,460
it is another MOT member in audience can
you raise your hand all right there so

522
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,300
he can verify an hour and that the main
account since

523
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,770
maybe he's lying like me we actually

524
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,900
we control every are back that is not a
lie you can go look on our

525
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,169
on on the PSI stuff and all that stuff

526
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:06,650
so that was all I think so what happened
was home

527
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,340
home we got into a big a big row with
them

528
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,720
because Chris Scoggins felt like duh

529
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,740
that like you know the legacy give LD is
now in jeopardy

530
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,810
so we got in a huge arguement stuff in
it was got on the phone

531
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,449
in like you know you're a weiner know
you're a weiner lol

532
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:28,609
use harsher turns the net believe me

533
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:31,668
but the point was that he wound up in a
batter

534
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:34,960
so the battle was totally lopsided

535
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,620
total lotsize: they had no skills it was
like that Emperor

536
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,850
made clear unbelievable in

537
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,580
anyway anybody here remember on QSD

538
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,090
QST an alto check in Germany

539
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:52,720
right so this was this was there this is
their attack

540
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,990
you are going to Key West easy cassius
and

541
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:59,590
anyone he won't keep in mind we're like
cut off their phones

542
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:03,400
I'd set up like a fax right in half like
it had like a bank

543
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,550
10 modems and I have a script that would
cause like cutting off the phone coming

544
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:08,970
off your phone

545
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:14,359
is harsh right is like a reality we got
you get up the phones dead

546
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,130
way does not humiliating was crushing

547
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,930
what crushes a man

548
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,259
and I have done is an experiment is I
know

549
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,820
is a matching your phone ring in 24
hours a day 7

550
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,560
days day name what numbers calling you

551
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,350
is just 10 10 Mon on his recruiting

552
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:40,350
you can pull it out you put in a row two
days later

553
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:44,230
for her

554
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,750
you always chillin on that oh that was
my favorite Rick

555
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,660
a matrix 0 that once a week so we got it
is bad but they're

556
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:55,270
idea battle with they would you know QST

557
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,940
any remember it was like like there was
like forty two slots right

558
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,590
which this law firm in Italian in
Frankfort

559
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,660
forty two slots so what they did was
build up

560
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,600
each they feel dizzy connected to the 12
slots

561
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,850
actually left one hoping like 10 pins
you can login

562
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,880
and you would see every single name was
Mike I will namely

563
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,980
more be even know better

564
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,340
he was like do like are we fighting a
war or is this lights

565
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,930
we are you one anybody could do that
like you know any ways to make a party

566
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:32,319
perfectly good a monks doing it with
them

567
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,990
marks to make up forty two connections
wasted

568
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,900
but here's the thing: soul me want to do
any small things would get on a chat in

569
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,210
Germany and be like

570
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,240
a they have what we would see them
chatting maybe like

571
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,480
they have more power than then anyone
hacker should have especially that

572
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,590
corrupt is

573
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,520
head is full himself in a number totally
if anybody knows I was always a nice guy

574
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,290
like don't do that I really like might
have like you know

575
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:02,700
I will always be like you don't do that
I was the mediator

576
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,900
it was some way but I was the mean guy I
don't know why I was never

577
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:09,720
minga but anyway the point is that we
had arm

578
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,850
arm they would do in Acme while we were
busy

579
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,250
taking all this stuff so be hailed

580
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:19,430
so what happened was we saw 11 ish
Germany Czech

581
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:24,540
but the problem was they were using this
in you why network user ID

582
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,000
out a farm out a Texas and it was call

583
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,130
will the big schism was that everybody's
in porn master

584
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,180
X 25 right for master had made this

585
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,990
neyo in 10 net which was owned by PT
Telkom

586
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,930
and unfortunately the story is that are
actually

587
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,000
to him make which was a big mistake
wanted

588
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:51,220
I'm using species UFO's aghast reviews
like

589
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,850
saxophone a great space coaster yeah

590
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,200
who'll so the for you

591
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,170
so so buy it but paul was a good guy
before he way

592
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:09,690
you know beautiful mind on the field

593
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,020
sorry do on so we had arm

594
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,960
so so here it was week is likely raised
a we see the logging in from Texas

595
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,060
with por mas take 75 n even worse

596
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:27,420
they were talking to my old group a lady
groove machine asking them to hack

597
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,540
the network operations center for Sprint

598
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,240
because they had access to the whole
primes de control de

599
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,589
any when busy migrating them to sign and
they didn't really know how to back door

600
00:38:38,589 --> 00:38:40,799
Sunday denied a backdoor primeval

601
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,839
play they didn't know how yeah we did
but they didn't know how to win

602
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,359
arm back toward the Sun we saw him doing

603
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,640
and we saw him give the log into to a

604
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:56,810
machines to take it back to Tucson for
them over in Texas we saw it we took

605
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:00,839
into the war right then and there and
then there was that was a

606
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,529
work a day doing he just had to cry an
email but it was a great experience I

607
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,180
mean I was he was why so this more
skirmishes

608
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,839
and stuff and mice a little tricks you
can do to really in no way somebody

609
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:12,940
always thought about you know writing

610
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,410
little book on how to religious and let
you know a few million only somebody

611
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:20,049
the same way you know I talk to you
about the bank modems this is real

612
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:20,710
simple

613
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,710
and you probably thought about this is a
text message you know somebody as a text

614
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,109
message main you can really get like

615
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:30,520
anonymous male situation going you even
know how to hack

616
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,280
and just set it up religious you know
was a cool down

617
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,900
passive aggressive attack I don't even
