1
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,090
oz anybody like Aquino pro cuz I have
all the notes

2
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,770
in year and it seems to be showing the
same thing on both screens

3
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,960
you know i mean alright I'm

4
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,980
systems

5
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:42,980
displays

6
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,990
arrangement turn off parent

7
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:54,760
ice

8
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,000
your can mmm your

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,420
schism in 10 innings

10
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,710
note that there

11
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,430
million them for the two monitors now

12
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,920
should be screened was pick which one
yet yeah

13
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,280
going backwards and direction you know
Cena

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,180
okay

15
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,250
thank you still make details

16
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,250
run through her

17
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,040
now that is weird

18
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,020
is that

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,548
called him months I am

20
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,500
use the other LCD window that we have so
we're on it now

21
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,490
think do X with yeah

22
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,540
mmm right on minsky

23
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:06,540
yet to their I'm late

24
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,430
for some reason projectors cutting off
parts I can't ground

25
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,480
some back to mirror for seconds the
committee's on

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,480
you know down

27
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,040
song expected

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,040
can this dragon hours with no yeah yeah
them

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,990
yeah model nice

30
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,140
yea thanks D

31
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,800
maybe sorry ass am

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,010
okay so %ah

33
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,209
there's not going to be as much like
robotics

34
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,400
focus as far as I could live robotics is
there was originally

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,000
so if you came to see like a buncha
robotics platforms is only gonna be one

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,480
year

37
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,710
so okay arm

38
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,480
what see so

39
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,290
allotted this is research that i've kind
accumulated from different sources a lot

40
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,900
on my ideas are thrown in your other
people's ideas I'm not claiming that

41
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,310
any this is my no arm you know if you
want to talk more about sources and

42
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,400
where I got the stuff from

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,870
you know feel free to asked me at the
end so

44
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,990
aka arm so the items are gonna cover RR

45
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:09,750
facts and concepts the singularity are
proteins singularity

46
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,950
are merging robotics and artificial
general intelligence

47
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,890
evolutionary robotics and kinda

48
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,870
our responsibilities as hackers in as
citizens

49
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:24,890
and Om we're gonna do I get quick

50
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,440
our genetic programming web arts demo so

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,169
so you're back in concert the singularly

52
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:35,430
so out what is the singularity

53
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,020
possible terms first used are from a
technological perspective in 1958

54
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,190
and it was written in reference to a
conversation with God John von Neumann

55
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:48,620
I paraphrase ever XO learning progress
of technology

56
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:53,040
gives the appearance approaching some
essential singularity in which humans

57
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,690
affairs

58
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,030
as we know them could not continue so

59
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,270
mint.com already begun this no we can't
take away a lot of the

60
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,080
technology we already have arm

61
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,039
the inventor and author rem Kors was
taken singularly concept to describe his

62
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,620
attitude in believe pertaining to time
in the future

63
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,580
ought to Kors while the future
singularly isn't a hundred years away

64
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,599
more like 30 or 40 so we're we're gonna
talk a lot about his beliefs but we

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,740
don't follow them blindly

66
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,210
other some dating here and some
projections about

67
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,520
up talking to the point so let's get are

68
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,520
into a little bit more also an
interesting thing to consider is

69
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,930
are measured in today's reader progress

70
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,410
and we're going to get to the math
behind this is ob-

71
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,990
the next 14 years is actually equivalent
to twenty years a progress and

72
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:49,080
sure some people have heard this before
like I said we're gonna get in a little

73
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,030
bit in the math

74
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,190
arm the next 100 years

75
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:56,440
is actually called the twenty thousand
years a technological progress

76
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,240
so it sounds kinda crazy but there's
mouth explains this

77
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,710
arm the technological progress the first
two decades

78
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,820
matches the entire nineteen hundreds

79
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,900
and people of this state that you know
we will see that

80
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,990
for a hundred a hundred years and
they're right

81
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,050
but they can I feel to realize I with
the exponential increase in technology

82
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,390
you know progressing arm so now we're
gonna look at some data

83
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,830
%uh that's generated from the law the
accelerating returns

84
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:35,830
which again you know we're going to
cover the math in a little bit still the

85
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,909
most important factor

86
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,220
on the singularity states that were on
the new even exponential curve

87
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,539
of technological progress %uh so this
diagram popular with accurate data are

88
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:50,740
presented view the future where
technological capabilities

89
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,250
on only rival that every human brain but
at some point

90
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,910
Rob ravel the collective power of all
human brains are these fees are

91
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,890
short-lived

92
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,810
is the trend only increases in power and
speed so

93
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,820
Kors why would project the teens such
power is between forty

94
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,860
are for years away so

95
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,479
another major attributes the similarity
is that made made creations

96
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,760
was surpassed humans in general
intelligence and then go on to create

97
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,560
machines their own sold by general
intelligence will mean

98
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,860
arm what my specialized intelligence we
mean

99
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,210
machines offer that service limited
purpose

100
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,700
such as the someone car running Internet
traffic and by generalize intelligence I

101
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,840
we refer to machines and software

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,560
they have the ability to solve a variety
of complex problems

103
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,940
in complex environments

104
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,510
so your we have a slider love castro

105
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,060
an deep blue an epic battle

106
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,770
are the 1997 contest lewis's first
competitive match that he never lost

107
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,780
in our summer times during the matches

108
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,040
CAS proper ported signs mine in the
machine

109
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,870
and the second tournament he worried
that there might be humans

110
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,490
behind-the-scenes

111
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,870
yes to caspar of claims the senior
opponents mines during play

112
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,830
understanding and exploiting their plans
and ordinary chests

113
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,120
computers your boards mechanical
predictability

114
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,240
on stemming from there under stream
anything but limited look ahead and

115
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,340
absence a long-term strategy

116
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,360
but in the blue to his consternation
he's on staten intelligence

117
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,690
so to understand this alien intelligence
we're going to take a closer look at how

118
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,940
deep blue works

119
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,579
so Rd plutons large databases opening in
game positions

120
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:48,610
are for both opening and impositions
optimal strategies known and stored in

121
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,790
the database

122
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,870
months a position is evaluating seed in
the transfers

123
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,310
now transposition table to avoid
reevaluating

124
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,400
are deeply was able to search between
six and 12 plies

125
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,160
in some cases up to forty so apply in
chess is a half move

126
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,390
so it twenty turn Chesky McCann system
for replies

127
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,380
arm so does deep blue exhibit
intelligence

128
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,230
are researches show that suspect experts
recognize and remember

129
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,600
meaningful patterns but it's difficult
to design pattern recognition chess

130
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,260
programs that matching see the ability
of humans

131
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,810
so instead chess programs rely on what
computers are good at

132
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,110
what's the calculations and search so
deep blue's creators no its quantitative

133
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,170
superiority

134
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,280
over other chess machines intimately but
they lack the understanding sharecast

135
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:47,280
bras appreciation in the difference in
the quality of play

136
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,020
so engineers to know the mechanisms

137
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,360
%uh advance robots most intimately will
be the last to admit that they have real

138
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,829
mines

139
00:09:57,829 --> 00:10:01,510
I human brain under a neurobiologist
microscope doesn't exhibit the

140
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,060
intelligence a dozen the lively
conversation

141
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,720
and are from the inside robots will
indisputably blue jeans

142
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,670
acting according the mechanical
properties

143
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:18,130
not so in 30 years our computer chess is
progress from Los steps

144
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:21,490
to the high soon peak if you just
performance

145
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:25,270
I in coming decades as general-purpose
computer power grows beyond the blue

146
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,030
specialized strains

147
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,569
machines will begin to match you means a
more common skills

148
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,150
so this graph shows are that is the
computation power increases

149
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,329
are the number of positions a
value-added increases

150
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:42,579
which also increases the number applies
the software is able to search

151
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,360
posso these increases lead to more
powerful chest machines

152
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,760
that will eventually Rd Willoughby
Grandmaster which

153
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,640
happened so I mean if you feel a missing
the software aspect of this

154
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,459
arm you know more power doesn't mean
smart machines

155
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:03,440
well that's definitely true and you know
we'll touch on that in a little bit

156
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,630
%uh so finally we're gonna touch upon

157
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,510
the merger or biological thing in our
technological creations

158
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,800
so we've already seen such events in
creations in our lifetime

159
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,130
and then we can cautiously extrapolate
how he seems to be in the immediate

160
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,350
future in a few years beyond

161
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,120
so I believe it's safe to say that that
no one can accurately predict the future

162
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:33,120
but I it's definitely fascinating and
daunting think about

163
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,520
on audien coming

164
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,100
them that's

165
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,110
in Europe no birth

166
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:54,120
style

167
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,550
years communities with you yes

168
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:01,890
normalized safe the future

169
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,750
will have local people with microscopic
plants

170
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:10,370
with the ability to surf the web just by
think

171
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,809
so are this gentleman is an actually
controlling arm

172
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:16,829
I with his brain he has a foot pedal

173
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:20,189
but is a hard to imagine that you know
in the future will have

174
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,980
Bob berberine machine interfaces in
Bergen actually take a look at one

175
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,179
now saw %uh

176
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:32,860
this isn't how this is in her butt no
dollars an hour Morgan she had a micro

177
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,650
wire implanted into our frontal lobe

178
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:39,579
in every 50 to 100 milliseconds Irene's
are taking

179
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:43,020
and after training job opening for
mechanical arm

180
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,980
I would just your thoughts so the 100
neurons provides roughly 7 percent

181
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,059
accuracy in the trajectory the arm
compared to the actual farts

182
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,689
and you know the figure without to up
500 to 700 neurons

183
00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:00,050
they can have a 95 percent accuracy

184
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:03,439
so itself thinks I'm imagining these to
you

185
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,790
different areas to be combined in the
future and I'm sure that will see that

186
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,689
at some point arm we're going to take a
quick look at our our biological and

187
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:13,030
technological progress

188
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,679
are over our history so

189
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:21,480
so this is right fingers while and
business says that over the last

190
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,089
you know billion years up over one
million years not much happened in over

191
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:28,010
a quarter million years ago

192
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:32,000
are such offense the evolution over
species occurring time frames are just

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,290
a hundred thousand years and in
technology if we go back fifty

194
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,980
years fifty thousand years I'm not much
has happened over a 1000 year period

195
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,860
are but in the recent past miss new
paradigms such as the World Wide Web

196
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,459
with progress from inception to mass
adoption within only a decade

197
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,750
so I think that this trend will continue
into the future

198
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,490
and it basically boils down to new
species altering events will happen

199
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:59,339
lesser amounts the time

200
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,679
and the fact is our technological
evolution will far surpass our

201
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:05,140
biological evolution

202
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,939
arm so let's look at the log sawing

203
00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:12,790
accelerating returns which is what we
spoke about earlier

204
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,689
and that Beasley provides the basis for
exponential progress

205
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:21,429
so are what's fuming explosion

206
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,100
so log sawing returns the bases so much
occurs walls belief that the singular

207
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,329
will happen in the next 30 to 40

208
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:31,530
years and not in 300 or 400

209
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:35,069
so it basically states the rate of
technological growth is a doubly

210
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:37,030
exponential phenomenon

211
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,079
so our for V let's say the computer
powers a linear function

212
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:45,780
the knowledge of how to build computers
are in this is conservative because

213
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,819
innovations improve the by multiple and
not an additive

214
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:53,920
we should also say that our that the W
is cumulative

215
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,290
are these are based on the observation
that relevant technological

216
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,569
albums are accumulating incremental way

217
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,929
and what TV all the time so

218
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:08,170
the formula basically says that arm if
the the regime change in

219
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,410
on the functions to do w over DT are

220
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,660
is equal to a constant c1 c2 W not

221
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,610
times the function the dissolution w's
an exponential function

222
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,610
I which is basically what he describes
the singularity and it reinforces mean

223
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,140
point that we're gonna see

224
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,160
technological innovations explode
exponentially in coming years

225
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,980
are there's a lot other like matthew and
stuff ministry talk about it later

226
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,420
if people are interested so

227
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:38,770
I mean years %uh to get a sense of what
he's stating

228
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,000
arm and in roughly drafting this
equation

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,860
it would kinda look like this are and as
you can see him in the graph starts out

230
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,069
with the gradually increasing slope any
kinda kinda skyrockets incomes very

231
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:51,910
steep

232
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,920
and the feeling is that work right now
work on on the New Year that

233
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,959
so

234
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:02,260
so let's talk about like the approach to
the singularity

235
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,920
arm occurs assets on a map for the
singularities basically as follows:

236
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,079
home that there won't be or there will
be

237
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,520
a gradual progression from Siemens to
buy a lot from biological to

238
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,110
non-biological

239
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,459
as we saw in an earlier slide this is
already happening

240
00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:23,140
arm not really want to get into new
technology by

241
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,870
its it's definitely real there aren't
really any Nina robots yet

242
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:30,429
it's the hypothetical by it's something
that you know lot of people think we're

243
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,079
gonna see in the future

244
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,309
arm basically I'm our biological

245
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:39,910
intelligence and capabilities are are
pretty much fixed

246
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,660
are you we can get some optimizations do
like biotechnology

247
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,740
but our the non-biological portion will

248
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
ultimately predominate

249
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,459
soon the similarity occurs in our
non-biological portion

250
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:57,610
is is bonanza times work even wall then
are we still going to link our

251
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,260
consciousness to the biological portion
of our intelligence

252
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,299
masa something to think about

253
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,500
so so imagine the we are machines in

254
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,920
and we're really sophisticated machines
me a Billings biomolecules

255
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,209
n me in Iraq to clean a well-defined

256
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,809
though not completely known our rules:
driving from physics and chemistry

257
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,589
so on eased biomolecular interactions
taking place inside her have

258
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,510
had give rise to relax in our feelings
in our senses self

259
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,670
so of we accept this hypothesis that
opens up the possibility

260
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:39,309
the sofa really machines and we can
learn the rules governing our brains

261
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,840
are then in principle there isn't any
reason why we should be able to

262
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,970
replicate those

263
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,220
in in computers are you know

264
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,400
our creations so artificial

265
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,250
creations they could exhibit genuine
human level intelligence emotions in

266
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,679
human consciousness

267
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,799
if we were to see this arm

268
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:02,860
so I don't think there's going to be are

269
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,700
like a similarly Big Bang that springs
these things in the life

270
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,520
I think that starting with them I'll be
intelligent systems that we have today

271
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,620
I machines will become gradually more
intelligent

272
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:21,049
generation after generation so the
single ladies similarly won't be pureed

273
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:24,100
arm you know it in

274
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,380
you really want me event it will be it
will be a period

275
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,730
arm and this period will come visit time
we'll invent

276
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,960
perfecting deploy you more cable systems

277
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,110
are driven not by the imperative of the
seniority itself by the usual

278
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,690
economic and social logical factors art

279
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,900
eventually may truly create artificial
intelligence is

280
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:50,240
with consciousness are recognizably
similar to our own

281
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,370
so I expect our

282
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,750
artificial general intelligence in the
future embodied as maybe

283
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,230
robots the room our homes and workplaces
arts emerge

284
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,410
gradually in symbiotic we with our
society

285
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,580
at the same time we humans will
transform ourselves

286
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,330
will incorporate a wide range of
advanced sensory devices in prosthetics

287
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,899
to enhance our bodies

288
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,410
as our machines become more like us will
become more like them

289
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:20,610
your question sure

290
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:26,630
the year

291
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,250
some think

292
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,450
100

293
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,110
up you would

294
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:47,110
work comes that good

295
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:56,669
so quickly being

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,850
group now

297
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:06,420
for it

298
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,580
yeah I mean the

299
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,899
the aspect of the no power increasing in
Moore's laws in all these things you

300
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,730
know there's things that are going to
happen in

301
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,120
di can't really be stopped but but the

302
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:24,450
but the mind that you know the aus the
Einsteins the the very people that have

303
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:27,110
the very smart you have to figure these
things I'll that doesn't follow the

304
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,930
schedule

305
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,130
so i'd yeah just because you have the
computer power

306
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,650
that doesn't necessarily mean that these
things are all going to happen

307
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,750
and as far as it being smooth like I
think that you know we're already doing

308
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,660
these things now

309
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,570
like we have rumors you know got iPhones
its in its crazy and you just gonna see

310
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,590
it become like more ubiquitous in

311
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,810
so I mean I don't really feel that we're
just gonna wake up one day and

312
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:52,070
we're gonna be in the matrix like I just
don't really see that happening

313
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,300
would

314
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,149
is sort Mike

315
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:08,149
mmm rape

316
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:16,099
said

317
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,299
said

318
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:27,408
group he's I agree with you and me.
coworkers law would say so but

319
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:31,439
I just personally I don't think it will
be that way I think it will be

320
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:34,129
will be a little bit smoother you know I
think would start to see these things

321
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:34,769
because

322
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,909
you know it I don't know the math says
it's gonna happen it's gonna be a big

323
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,889
enough for the masses but I mean

324
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:44,389
that's not how I feel what me to this
guy we can wouldn't yeah

325
00:21:44,389 --> 00:21:47,669
wanted

326
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:54,669
your

327
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:02,809
id yep

328
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:06,299
right good sure

329
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,739
yeah I agree but I don't see a sleek

330
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:13,589
I see more of like the prosthetics

331
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:17,129
and no and now part the machine being
put us where we we still have this

332
00:22:17,129 --> 00:22:18,079
control and

333
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,688
and you know pieces being chains were no
are

334
00:22:21,689 --> 00:22:26,039
will in our thoughts and what kinda our
control is still there what's not to

335
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,759
like a Skynet thing where we

336
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:34,759
we football in its up

337
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:46,599
rape predicts

338
00:22:46,689 --> 00:22:53,230
or right you

339
00:22:53,230 --> 00:23:00,230
up

340
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:02,990
we're

341
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:08,230
their us

342
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,990
things really unless things or very
deliberately

343
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,670
constrained by a set of rules I'll like
three laws

344
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:22,330
then we won't have that kind of control
yeah I mean I don't know how I feel

345
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,230
about two or three laws think I

346
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,750
but it's similar frame or no I
understand that and that's why I feel

347
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,080
like

348
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,399
if I mean I guess I hope its mood
because if it's smooth these things are

349
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,690
party bus there some interaction there
there's some understanding

350
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,320
like versus flipping a switch in the
beam well you know we don't need you

351
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,050
anymore

352
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,440
good

353
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,110
nah yeah right

354
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,680
yep

355
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,970
discusses is that people

356
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,670
10+2 the approaching it like you're
looking at the future in what's going to

357
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,950
happen in the future but

358
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,940
kinda what presentations like this are
about is is

359
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:07,690
you pretend you're in the future looking
at the past like there will be a slow

360
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,420
grant like

361
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,630
ramp up like the internet happen
prosthetics happen

362
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,560
you know the ability to to compute grows
exponentially and

363
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:19,639
it might appeared at people from the
outside that there is gonna wake up one

364
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,410
day and

365
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,320
intelligence is ridiculously smart but
when they look back over time it's going

366
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,800
to have been a slow ramp-up

367
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,230
and it's going to look like that on the
grass I'll

368
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,260
use may not see it that way as it's
happening sure

369
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,410
that makes I will keep going in and
build more

370
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,150
will do questions arm so I'll

371
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:42,150
we're gonna talk about like some
roadblocks and stuff now so over the

372
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,800
past 50 years are

373
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,010
artificial intelligence is made you know
tremendous progress

374
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,970
are you can find a base capabilities in
things such as the search engines

375
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,050
voice recognition stock trading outs but
I you can't really engage

376
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,530
in AR heart to power source chat with
any of them

377
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,889
so we did we definitely have a lot of
heart problems before we build anything

378
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,320
that might qualify

379
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,260
as artificial general intelligence and
yeah I what this is speaking your point

380
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,790
that you know a lot of problems become

381
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:15,920
years computer power reliably increases
exponentially

382
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,040
are but we also need no fundamental
breakthroughs

383
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,440
and you know those will happen when they
happen definitely in the

384
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,700
they might be able to be somewhat
predicted but they still they take time

385
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,830
arm but now we're gonna look like
specifically in a robot controllers in

386
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,830
genetic programming who knows a brief my
original programming

387
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,139
okay cool arm so let's recap the
seniority

388
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,620
up hoops so

389
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,530
somebody's you're still science fiction
but you know it

390
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:50,940
probably very likely at some point arm
will begin you science and technology

391
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,260
not just a man is the world around us
but to manage our own human biology

392
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:58,410
a change will be faster and more
profound

393
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:01,890
the very slow changes that would occur
over 1000 the years as a result of

394
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,380
natural selection

395
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,220
and biological evolution arm

396
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:11,600
but I it's kinda funny what's happening
right now in Oxford England ha there's a

397
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,080
conference use main focuses on global
catastrophic risks

398
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,300
in the final the conference are for the
focus will be on

399
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,620
unintended consequences new technologies
such as super intelligent machines

400
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,510
and so know it appears that even though
this current thread is is not exist in

401
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,890
its still cartons

402
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,760
many people's attention great your I
don't know

403
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,260
they my I don't know how much like
nanotechnology they're talking about but

404
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:45,260
so alright yet

405
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,600
so is anybody familiar with the the pair
to

406
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,340
robot okay so that's cool and I guess
you guys learn some

407
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,890
arm so is anybody fully with
evolutionary robotics

408
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,370
okay cool great so

409
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,300
arm were gonna talk about that so
evolution robotics is a technique for

410
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,990
automatic creation and overtimes robots

411
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:13,090
and I it's inspired by the Darwinian
principle of selective reproduction the

412
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:13,740
fittest

413
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,640
so its as far as I know it's a pretty
new approach maybe thirty years old

414
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,390
it looks is robots as autonomous
artificial organisms

415
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:26,270
and they develop their own skills in
close interaction with the environment

416
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,250
without human intervention

417
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:31,780
the issue me intervention but the point
is that

418
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,440
the behaviors that their evolving humans
are interacting with them at that point

419
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,060
so I'm just gonna go over some hardware
and software

420
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,230
so is the camper to there's one right
here

421
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,330
arm it's a row but was told by key team
a swiss-based company

422
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:50,429
are the cappers conception was brought
about from the need for physically

423
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:51,830
compact robot

424
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,760
with on-board processing capabilities
that can support complex algorithms

425
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,590
are such as that found in artificial
neural networks

426
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,890
are the Caparros very modular there's a
buncha by

427
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,580
additional visioning gripper radio
components a commune out on the robot

428
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,080
army canteen 826 make her processor 512

429
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,639
are infrared sensors and they have to
mod so the first mo design

430
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,000
emulate mode on

431
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,380
missions made using only the receiver
part a device with out in meeting anyway

432
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,150
in the second mode it measures light
reflected by obstacles

433
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,610
so this measures the light made emitting
light from the device

434
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,590
and the return value is a difference
between the measurement meet emitting

435
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,190
why

436
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,200
in the white measure with out light
emission so

437
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,560
Indian white arm so for evolution
robotics the

438
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:49,190
Caparros probably one of the most
popular robots

439
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:52,600
so there is more wet butts

440
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,970
okay so the software we're using home is
web arts it's prolly beloved my favorite

441
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,730
simulator I V some other ones by now

442
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,920
with boss is really cool but the the
professional version is really expensive

443
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,750
so

444
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,320
const Sox arm but basically

445
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,090
our web arts it supports a point to
different robotics platforms

446
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,950
its gonna 3d world are per game a
programmable characteristics for all up

447
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,950
all the elements in the environment and
I it can interface directly with the

448
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,410
apparent UR's 232

449
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,900
so we're going to try to do some stuff
for the and

450
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:32,370
arm the basic idea behind it which a
robotics

451
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,830
is that an initial population

452
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,320
have different artificial chromosomes
each encoding the control system the

453
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,419
robot

454
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,170
are raining we created important
environmental

455
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,240
each robot is then lets free to arm

456
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,770
to roam the environment in act
accordingly to a genetic be specified

457
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:52,870
controller

458
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:59,490
which are while its performance on
various Taz's I'm at the evaluated

459
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,890
so the status robots are allowed to
reproduce by generating copies either

460
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,040
gino types

461
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:08,850
in addition to change introduced by some
genetic operators such as meditation

462
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,990
in this process is repeated into an
individual was born which satisfies a

463
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:19,990
performance criteria set by the
experimenter

464
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,500
so the question is how do we determine
if the robots actions

465
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,740
are wanted and if you wanna propagated
to its offspring

466
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,200
so this is where we apply the fitness
function

467
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,190
for this example let's examine the task
love of school avoidance

468
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:41,070
because it's you know pretty basic in
its new for many real-world applications

469
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,310
arm for the Capra basically this task is
equivalent to minimizing

470
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,460
are the proximity sensors are one moving
to the environment

471
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,750
so the following fitness function are

472
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:57,520
encourages the robot to move in a
straight line through the environment

473
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,260
and punishes the robot for proximity
object proximity

474
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,810
are sluts actually take a look at the
fitness function

475
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:08,110
so that's the fitness function and

476
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:13,290
beastly m1 and m2 really moral values
which is negative wanna be 0 or -1 be

477
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,200
backwards you'll be stationary in
positive only

478
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,550
it's moving forward as you do at seven
are the proximity sensors

479
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,090
and right now they would be would say
they're really in the mood to which is

480
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,180
proximity detection

481
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,200
I a B&B are tuning weights

482
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,460
use imply important city to mean peace
is the equation

483
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,580
the moral values in the sensors so is
valued be approaches 0

484
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,730
are the fitness function becomes more
forgiving as the capper approaches walls

485
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,110
and obstacles

486
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,370
so up

487
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:54,290
yeah sorry they are

488
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:57,490
so here's a sample Ron Tom

489
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,520
by simple once more capra are basically
we're looking for action to provide

490
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,100
assistance greater than 0

491
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,910
so if you look at it r1 it shows a robot
moving both

492
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,210
both motos driving forward but not the
sensor

493
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,970
s is your was reading are very high so
it's getting our low fitness value

494
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,669
means by really close to an obstacle you
want that

495
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:25,560
so was a guitar tuner 3 so in the
perfect in fitness function we don't

496
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,050
care if the robots moving forward

497
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:33,530
or backwards on you also notice that all
the sensors are reading no values

498
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:38,020
which means the robot isn't in proximity
in any walls are obstacles

499
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:43,450
so it gets a good finish tied for that
off for some or all one

500
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:47,929
except we produce the way to be sis
allows the robot to pose obstacles in

501
00:32:47,929 --> 00:32:49,210
closer proximity

502
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:55,100
it might not be penalizes much I still
provides kinda sub-par fitness

503
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,530
on or five is in a bad fitness but in
this case the robot would actually be

504
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,190
spinning in a circle

505
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,280
I which is a very good behavior but it's
possible I'll write for the first few

506
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,310
generations

507
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,168
so we might let it go arm

508
00:33:11,169 --> 00:33:14,220
0 there some sample code there for
calculating fitness values

509
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,820
book we're gonna do some demonstrations
at the end anyways so

510
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,260
so I am we're gonna talk about genetic
programming quickly

511
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,460
so the basic question is how do we
involve

512
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,970
these robotic controllers in one answer
is our by genetic programming

513
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:34,650
so genetic programming utilizes in
surviving population to solve problems

514
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,760
within the fitness landscape

515
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:41,169
which is shown here on it's basically a
three-dimensional graphics valleys and

516
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:42,470
peaks

517
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,790
a number of individuals are randomly
scattered on the landscape

518
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,480
as you can see a little dots on are
priced in a soccer then applied to each

519
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,169
individual lansky

520
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:55,500
and those close to the peaks are found
to have a higher fitness value

521
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,020
and that's a lot to propagate their
genes by offspring

522
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:03,200
so it's important know there are
numerous pieces diagram our capital

523
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,450
no sub to you is actually the global
solution within the search space

524
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,550
that's that's our like optimal solution
whatever Palmer trying to solve

525
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:15,640
and other lower piece or two local
solutions so they may solve our problem

526
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,980
in the me satisfied said

527
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,940
fitness function but they're prolly not
the best solution to the problem

528
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,800
so this is for tree-based genetic
programming

529
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,220
so aspirin can be formed in a few ways
arm

530
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,740
a first we're gonna concentrate on cross
over by a tree-based genetic programming

531
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:39,660
so just imagine that that each of these
individuals is a complete computer

532
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,199
program

533
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,250
arm in examples you each individual can
be invalidated simply for demonstration

534
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,040
purposes

535
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,359
but imagine the each individual was a
complex program

536
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,120
they could possibly drive a motor Reed
sensor values will react to the

537
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,668
environment

538
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:00,240
so we we determine the fitness the
program is by Runyon

539
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,560
which in our case can be run via live
robot or were in the web out simulator

540
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,759
in the status is calculated by running
news with a variety of imports

541
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,190
sore sensors in our moral values we see
how close the program's output is to our

542
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,490
desired results

543
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,650
so we're actually going to do a
demonstration pretty soon to show you

544
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,140
exactly what I mean

545
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:24,029
arm as you can see our its is a single
point cross over into

546
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,460
it isn't totally random are the genetic
algorithm forces that the computations

547
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:33,180
are still awake a syntactically correct
computer programs

548
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:37,190
so we have laid you know the absolute
values something it's expecting one

549
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,290
particular argument

550
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,340
you can do cross over and give it
something that was taking multiple

551
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,780
arguments because

552
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,060
the program just my not compile why not

553
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,690
you can see how you know these parents
yield to offspring

554
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,080
and it's basically just switching the
two parts that are highlighted in the

555
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,100
bottom

556
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,750
so you slowly like evolving on this
program in whatever it is you're trying

557
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,470
to solve this equation for

558
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,580
YouTube applying the fitness value you
know to the result

559
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,250
if it's you know within some percentage
what you feel is acceptable

560
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,780
those are you know genotypes that you
would wanna propagate

561
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,470
in continue evolving it's very similar
to us some more like national selection

562
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,609
mobbed our own stuff so

563
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:25,160
so the fuel that evolution robotics in
genetic programming it's definitely has

564
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:29,080
evolved successful controllers for some
other tasks analysts

565
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,230
arm you have to keep in mind that you
know if you to sit down right

566
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,420
these out by hand and you know the
computer everything he it would

567
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,550
they're not always super easy your
programming for one particular

568
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,050
environment may not scales another
environment you know there's the what

569
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,520
some things to consider so

570
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,000
you know any decides that things are
it's been done

571
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,380
in the predator and prey stuff is really
cool because you'll actually see the

572
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,820
robots evolving strategies in

573
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,480
it's really interesting not all these
things I mean they're not

574
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,250
to me easing but it is pretty cool that
you can evolve programs to do stuff

575
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,859
so mean probably more exciting in in the
coming years

576
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,630
arm so here's our really recent
experiment by 10

577
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,820
leaders evolution robotics on diário of

578
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:22,180
for ya know in basically a group of
identical robots replacing environment

579
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,940
they can't eat food employees in

580
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:28,070
anybody heard about this now I'm so um

581
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,510
the robots can tell which item for food
were pleasantly were nearly touching

582
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:34,740
those red stationary objects

583
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,370
and for four different types the
colonies a robot's they're allowed to

584
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,069
eat reproducing expire

585
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,930
by the fiftieth generation the robots
learn to communicate

586
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,680
you can see I did light up isolate
others that they found for poison

587
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,509
and the fourth colony so sometimes
evolved a cheater robots

588
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,970
and they would actually light up and
talk to others that the poison was mood

589
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,710
and they themselves a goal were over the
food source in and chow down without

590
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,240
telling anybody else what they had found

591
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,460
so so you know if you think for second
about the the fitness landscape that we

592
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,440
were talking about

593
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,260
you could come to hypothesize that
developing a teen behavior it could be a

594
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,550
local peak

595
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,230
sonya shuru works arm

596
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,359
but it may not work in the long term you
if you continue to propagate

597
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,950
the jeans tumors offspring and there's
an overwhelming percent of the

598
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,280
population that's you know

599
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,210
involved in this deceitful behavior I
you might in the might start doing each

600
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:31,810
other and just

601
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:36,029
making a lot of mistakes in its it spine
%uh the best thing

602
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:39,270
but still interesting to see that you
know now this was programmed to be there

603
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:41,130
via this behavior

604
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,280
are so it's just one recent

605
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,060
I example one is pretty interesting so

606
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,160
this is pretty short by basically

607
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,129
you know no sorry

608
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:02,150
yeah one

609
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:09,150
yes sure the arm

610
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,950
year so the bottom sources food that top
sources poison is

611
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,359
is far as I can League figure from the
video I don't really know but you can

612
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:19,600
tell the car to hover around in the
least

613
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,839
and this one you know was lighting up
blue he's found through east on these

614
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,310
other guys I can of food you know

615
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:30,029
come check it out so sir

616
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,150
yen

617
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,340
they can tell did

618
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:42,650
yet the I don't know the specifics of it
I don't know why they light up and I'm

619
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,090
just assuming that there in proximity a
bit like

620
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:48,640
it extends to the robots are also
touching the food source so

621
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,640
in a cappuccino robots think if they're
passing down the line I don't know

622
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:03,710
work there

623
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,490
E

624
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,569
right

625
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:20,569
yep

626
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,240
me

627
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,870
experiment as well yeah I mean a

628
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,950
on that point I mean they definitely
evolved on their own likes warm

629
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,750
behaviors

630
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,000
nothing was was program you know so
pre-existing

631
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,720
so um you know I don't I don't feel that
we're gonna be replaced by saw for

632
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,470
robots anytime soon

633
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:51,800
nom but we are going to see our
biological evolution piece to pass an

634
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,020
engineer with our technological
creations

635
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,210
so you know I just think it's important
that you know everybody here just

636
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:01,650
keeps doing what you do when you're all
here for a reason we enjoy the shit

637
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:02,370
whatever

638
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,710
in our you know I on not a

639
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,140
among college I don't whatever I do this
to my free time like this shit so I can

640
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,060
I encourage everybody do the same

641
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,250
you know so on so read you

642
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:20,460
we got I've 37 minutes year so me try to
do too quickly demonstrations are first

643
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,910
you need for genetic programming the
others going to be with the

644
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:29,910
with the Capra om

645
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,569
group okay says

646
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:41,540
on man oca

647
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:48,540
mmm

648
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:58,799
there isn't

649
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,790
are there is it's like behind my you
know kills

650
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:08,790
occur

651
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:15,810
okay so so

652
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,880
for this first example arm we're going
to use genetic programming

653
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,700
I to evolve a function that will solve
an equation for some

654
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,140
we're gonna provide X this is like a
pretty basic thing if there's some

655
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,990
genetic programming guys the priciest

656
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,150
yeah arm

657
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:40,080
op well okay allman the important part
is here

658
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,180
sauce all switchover

659
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,759
arm so basically we want to serve why
for the values VAX

660
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,460
it's pretty simple stuff civil
polynomials and we expect you to look

661
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,430
something similar to

662
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:58,060
you know this is what we want the song
we want the computer to figure this out

663
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,390
so we're going to take points along this
line I have

664
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:06,069
ten different points here we're gonna
feed it to genetic program

665
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:13,070
and I am its gonna run five what up to
five hundred generations

666
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:17,970
int its good start with $500 million
programs

667
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,880
and each protein is I made against the
fitness function we basically plug in

668
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,780
the axe about you

669
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,369
we compared to the answer against the
desired y value of the program's

670
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:30,760
within 1 percent we consider close
enough me

671
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,920
continue to let live to the next
generation a sixty-percent degeneration

672
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,480
or new programs created by a crossover

673
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:42,070
which we saw before on 39 percent or
direct copies in one person and you take

674
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,780
copies

675
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,589
arm so here the values that we hardcoded

676
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:51,849
these are gonna be in the program so
first you can actually run the program

677
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:55,640
and just to save time I guess that are
hard coded in there so

678
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:02,089
so it's running through the generations
its

679
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:05,750
K so get the generation 500 thats

680
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,780
that may not be great I'll

681
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,230
the next thing we can do is actually
take a look at the Cowboys so let's

682
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:19,230
let's see with this thing came up with

683
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:35,690
so that looks pretty accurate you can
see the offload GP function there

684
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,840
now looks pretty good so let's let's
test it out

685
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,780
on board meeting was your gonna run this
this check axe

686
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,650
where we have all the x-bow is already
put in your its gonna

687
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:50,700
compute the y values and the matching
against the set that we already gave it

688
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,020
like

689
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,920
its own hard coded to save time but it
is actually using this function that was

690
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,730
generated

691
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,180
so let's take a look at the whole point
so sweet I mean this looks pretty damn

692
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,029
good light

693
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:05,950
you can see the y values or what the
hardcoded the first y value in the

694
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,720
second my values what was actually
calculated ass

695
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,490
and you can see that I mean there
alright well the first is kinda fucked

696
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,710
up for the rest MWA really good

697
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,950
so I mean basically what how it happened
years we took

698
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:23,450
up to five hundred generations we were
able to move at all are the top floor GP

699
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,290
function which actually solved

700
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:29,290
for the X Y values that we provided for
that particular polynomial

701
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:36,290
so yep arm

702
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:40,120
I now tho extra pin all that shit arm

703
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,299
but I mean if you look at it like it

704
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,510
minus that whatever's wrong with this
first one all those other values are

705
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:46,890
right

706
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,549
its it's gonna be graph to the same
thing I preacher

707
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:54,260
mean all those other guys much I was
wrong with the first one but

708
00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:00,930
would you try after I don't wanna strip
mall right now and your questions

709
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:05,319
aka arm then the next thing will do

710
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,810
if we have to have time no okay

711
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:12,470
arm sings Kanye di dau but

712
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:18,710
so this is the web at simulator

713
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:25,710
group

714
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,880
so right now we have our actual robot

715
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,700
and know it's moving its environment we
have a simple like

716
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,540
bromberg control i think is that a fat
one that they give you and

717
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,040
mmm

718
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,410
its hurtin not sure

719
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:58,680
well me

720
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,890
kill it tried again word

721
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:06,650
know this one is a right now I'm

722
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:13,650
I think it to finish in time for the
conference those things

723
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,160
eat Australia

724
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:27,009
right

725
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:31,560
okay so you know was a robot you can
have multiple ones you can code

726
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,740
controllers in here in CA think C-plus
Boston

727
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,490
Java hom you can see the readings year

728
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:42,550
the the evening light sensors and then
their proximity sensors will light up as

729
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,760
it gets closer stuff he's got his moral
values is rear sensors

730
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,170
in mean the great thing about web boxes
for genetic programming now you can

731
00:47:50,170 --> 00:47:51,500
evolve robots like

732
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,550
pretty quickly you can put this thing
like a fastball removing it just kinda

733
00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:00,360
does arm but the other cool thing about
it is

734
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,080
you can be certain the you know it's
kinda ghetto by

735
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:09,819
after you via the contrary actually want
to know check it out in the real world

736
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,390
is the make it so simple I can go from
simulation a remote control

737
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,779
I don't know how is your hand on the
surface but books

738
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:23,780
are come on

739
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:36,430
not it's not happen well

740
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:40,370
that socks but basically what you'd be
able to do is ideal the transfer

741
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:45,020
the program running to the robot right
now and still do my valuations

742
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,090
so I mean it's it's nearly impossible to
be evolving like genetic program he saw

743
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,410
I was five hundred generations to arrive
that really simple program

744
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,109
if you tryna bother Compu your comp
complicated for

745
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,080
is getting a long time water processing
power you will want to do in real time

746
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,870
you want to lease to bother to like a
particular point and then transfer to

747
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,589
the robot

748
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,530
I don't know why you know it's not
letting me do it

749
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:13,810
but sorry well we can fuck with the
later

750
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,200
but I guess I wraps it up so you guys
enjoyed it

751
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:24,200
questions sir in

752
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,609
arm you yeah basically like

753
00:49:32,609 --> 00:49:36,170
the chromosome is is the

754
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:40,970
is like a string of bits and in those
examples it was the actual like cold

755
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:41,259
there

756
00:49:41,259 --> 00:49:44,819
it could be even simpler me look at it
really simply could be zeros and ones

757
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:49,710
in you using not are one-point crossover
to do you like

758
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,630
you know see have four zeros for ones
you want to cross over yet knows your

759
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,599
0111 100

760
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:02,599
that would be the chromosomes that their
simplest point well

761
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:09,819
the controller E is like the result of
all the saffir so we would've I'll this

762
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:13,308
Lake if you were to take those simple
programs that we had before and those

763
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:16,119
were actually like picture the really
complicated programs

764
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:19,440
actually doing something we're evolving
all kinds of pieces 'em we're done

765
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,920
that's essentially our controller

766
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,410
you know we deployed and in control
robot with that so again most that would

767
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,828
be done the simulation

768
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:29,450
put in the room real robot to like
really test it out because you know

769
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,569
in the simulation sometimes I genetic
programming in the evolution robotics

770
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:35,269
will take advantage of

771
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:39,619
love exploits that with in this
simulator

772
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,089
no Norway's isn't gonna be the same the
friction against this table is not me

773
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:44,680
the same lighting is going to be
different

774
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,649
you can put in new ways you know I think
like 10 percent movies

775
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:52,849
is like a pretty common thing and it's
shown that when you put in new ways yes

776
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:56,029
you do evolve better controllers and I
and he's working for him like

777
00:50:56,029 --> 00:51:00,869
the n product love this program that
we've evolved sir

778
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:04,589
just just to clarify um

779
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:09,170
the mom I'm sorry um basically the the

780
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:12,440
chromosomes are determining various

781
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,849
behavioral characteristics the program

782
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:20,259
and its suitability is then you know
being evaluated

783
00:51:20,259 --> 00:51:23,369
based on criteria that the

784
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:27,099
behavior is at the resultant behaviors
being simulated

785
00:51:27,099 --> 00:51:30,319
and then judged I'm and Danny

786
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,640
comes down to you not natural selection
but artificial selection as determined

787
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,259
by

788
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:41,279
that criteria whether its survivability
in a certain environment or

789
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:45,089
whatever but it comes down to the same
principles that solution

790
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:49,038
and the rate at which it happens is
determined by

791
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,859
you know mutations speed how how
randomness

792
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,400
is implemented in in the evolution
process

793
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,210
I'm at each step and

794
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,380
sir

795
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:11,380
mom I see like a him on the guy with the
hat I'm curious on

796
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,859
how your research has been affected by
other research in the metaphysical

797
00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:18,808
concepts such as or as an energy in
those sorts of things because

798
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:22,710
I don't believe we can talk about I'm AI
artificial intelligence are

799
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:27,809
consciousness without those concepts as
well yeah when I started this I mean I'd

800
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:32,609
yeah it's incredible on I don't want to
bring a lot of thought into it because

801
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:36,380
I just your its too amazing

802
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:39,609
it's too much to grasp lick on one thing
but yeah I mean that's that's huge in

803
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:42,630
that's kinda where a lot of this stuff
is going to go to you

804
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,910
spite super interesting on but I don't
want to really talk about here despite I

805
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:49,430
didn't feel I could do it justice

806
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,440
you know so good point though are

807
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,029
got the yeah so

808
00:52:58,029 --> 00:53:01,059
let's assume that you know we overcome
all the technical

809
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:04,819
and biological technological hurdles to
achieve the singularity

810
00:53:04,819 --> 00:53:09,170
if you look at the state in the world
right now a very small proportion

811
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:12,450
of humanity actually has access to
computers

812
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:17,039
and advanced technology so what happens
when we achieve the singularity

813
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:21,619
ends one percent of global population is
TransUnion and the rest is based on

814
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:27,329
it yeah I mean if you just on that point
like with all my personal feelings

815
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,619
yeah that's scary right i mean that
sucks if all the rich people live

816
00:53:30,619 --> 00:53:32,839
everything in the dysfunction up even
more like

817
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:35,900
yeah thats awful and they probably will
do that

818
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:41,269
delayed you would hope they I just went
to the the the things about new

819
00:53:41,269 --> 00:53:44,690
technologies if you can have these
devices that can manufacture anything

820
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:47,349
then you know you can build anything you
can make anything

821
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:50,880
kinda breaks down that rich-poor divide
but again at the same time like well

822
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:51,359
then

823
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,670
with what's the value with anything you
can make whatever you want like

824
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:58,859
I don't know it's a great question and I
hope things don't I hope things get

825
00:53:58,859 --> 00:53:59,410
better

826
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:03,098
like I wouldn't want to see things get
worse so

827
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:10,099
sir

828
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,329
sure yeah the point yup repeat the
question

829
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:28,490
hope 0

830
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,170
the yep any more questions one minute

831
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:35,339
yeah

832
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:39,270
no is waiving

833
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:42,380
alright your sorry

834
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,500
one quick question just wondering the
singularity farmers you're presenting

835
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,400
earlier do you know if farm any thought
has been given to any table

836
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,030
you know psychological tolerance is ur
socio-economic tolerances

837
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,380
or even global resource tolerances or is
that just pure math

838
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:02,540
arm yeah I mean as far as late

839
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:07,730
the you know the computation aspect
double like

840
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:11,970
how much computation block items going
beyond computers things I think

841
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:15,400
that that does take it down into his
like respect but

842
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:19,099
as far as the the emotional and
psychological now I mean

843
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:25,500
I don't know it's a good question now
which

844
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,579
right right so

845
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,200
alright well thanks for comment because
good etc
