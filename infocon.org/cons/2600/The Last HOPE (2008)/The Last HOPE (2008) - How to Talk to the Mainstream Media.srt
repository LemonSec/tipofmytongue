1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:04,470
narrative oftentimes its very hard for
me to tell that story to readers who

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,529
doesn't have to read it

3
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:09,410
the narrative is kind of like the sugar
around medicine

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,180
and if I can t people that sugar then
it's a bitter pill I'm worried

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,219
and so I really like to have stories I
have

6
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:20,710
narrative and some sort novelty like
you've got great characters

7
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,370
if I've got some sort of goods you know
sequence of events in their

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:27,750
vacation maybe it's a very complex issue
that has marked significance to

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,039
but I need to give the reader in a few
sentences a reason why they should keep

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,350
in the article and so I will use

11
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,550
single sentence may be to sum up
something or some of its significance

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,670
people sometimes we get annoyed with
because they think I'm bomb oversimplify

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,960
a complicated story but

14
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,059
the point is that I give them the huge
great novelty wall

15
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,960
all their caviar to nuances and
everything right up front

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,469
we know they're not going to read that
much further down

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,210
into the article they always have to
know wire the reading

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,200
the story so that's what I need to tell
the reader so

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,540
what this means for you is that if

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,959
you can tell me that little piece of
information if you can help me find a

21
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,530
story

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:12,740
fuking package up to a certain extent
for me

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,779
the little shiny no one sends take away
and give that to me

24
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:21,069
you're much more likely to find that i'm
gonna be able to take your story or your

25
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:25,149
event or whatever it is you're trying to
get out and put that into a story

26
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:28,429
so again interesting characters tell
apart to give its novelty

27
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:31,520
am one may be enough coffee is awesome

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,090
and these are just things anyone when a
pair mind if you make the pitch for

29
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:35,979
giving an interview

30
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,389
am census break this down a little bit

31
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:43,789
interesting characters so this is why
you know you see lots larry's

32
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,959
am around the place because if I can put
somebody who the audience knows

33
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,609
in front of the audience and say that
they're talking about X automatically

34
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:51,969
going to be interesting to them

35
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,169
and if you don't have celebrities think
about an

36
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:59,908
the people in your organization and your
backgrounds and you also want to

37
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,749
establish your what's called a platform

38
00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:04,700
and if you don't miss everyone who's
you're just yourself you want to

39
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,169
establish

40
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:08,419
a platform by platform I mean serve
basis authority

41
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,960
and so you know necessarily rights very

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,510
dry copy try make as interesting as
possible it's got like the kinda stuff

43
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,530
you might see

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,750
you in and a caption of a strong the
story

45
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,900
and touching does it was Tech travels
his backpack trust for comments from

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,630
laptop

47
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,750
John Doe does all this going to get
stuff and

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,820
the reason why by these buyers helped
establish authority

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,730
is that it journalist and has a reason
to believe that you're worth quoting

50
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,130
am and later on I'll talk a little bit
had actually get a platform it get to

51
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,700
the TV pundit stage

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,280
of that the time an tells a plot X

53
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,260
if you have a press release or if you're
being interviewed about something

54
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,260
and explain what happened and really

55
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,660
you know your captain Demi voice to a
certain extent

56
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,150
I mean talk to be a smart ass but be
explicit don't expect people to know

57
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,930
necessarily and say what a file system
is by of the top about

58
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,410
and you really have to see file system
could use useful way of storing

59
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,650
PO it so what you know we haven't we've
come up a new file system

60
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,040
you know or this file system is very
important

61
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,060
or you know a certain file says missie
patented might want to say well you know

62
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,350
this way of storing

63
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,140
files on disk for this way of storing
documents in don't use jargon try and

64
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:25,790
break it down

65
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,239
think in terms of things we explaining
things

66
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,870
think in terms of their functionality
not the terminology

67
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,260
but what are the actual to you what are
the mean for this particular

68
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,030
in this particular system again the best
way this is thinking

69
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,300
magistrates have some your story to some
in a bar bars a good cuz bars are noisy

70
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,900
he can really get it detail stuff you we
had a few sentences

71
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,830
explains so literally think in short
simple decorative sentences

72
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:55,280
how would you explain whatever it is
you're trying to do and

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
you don't really care necessarily very
much but implementation have technology

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,360
if you have to be talking about
technology

75
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,459
and computer you know

76
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,880
we computer programmers often thinkin
very abstract terms and structures and

77
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,250
so on its national because that's how
the John the structured

78
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,950
a really weird try to work a concrete
examples of things are

79
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,989
consequences so on thinking really terms
of

80
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,519
a user using a computer for a company

81
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,680
being affected by something really think
about what is the and

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,740
real-world manifestations something no

83
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,610
the internal structures that is often
are very important from a technical

84
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,409
point of view

85
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:34,479
but from the mainstream media they don't
really

86
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,529
you're not gonna care so much

87
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:41,419
explain the context what's going on and
this is where understanding that may be

88
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:42,020
a journalist

89
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,698
target audience comes in you know and

90
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,949
when I was on spectrum I was a beat
reporter for technology magazine so I

91
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:51,560
could go into I can actually go into
their technological

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,749
detail now at Discover Magazine I don't
quite go into detail but I'm still

93
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:58,919
science technology magazine so I can
take a certain amount of

94
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,090
a technical stuff and so with example
here is

95
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:06,849
to imagine any immediate up to the US
that has and additional income product

96
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,139
implications

97
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,650
and if I'm talking to Business Journal
they say somebody from the Economist

98
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,490
you're so what

99
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,469
you might want to lead my wanna talk
then about the impact on global

100
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:16,830
competitiveness

101
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,659
if I was a talk with some for the
village voice they don't wanna talk

102
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:21,300
about the free speech and

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,580
so the manoeuvre you really only going
to get one to three points

104
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,800
across the journalist think very hard
well at this point certainly can

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,150
think about the significance maybe not
so much the technical the technical

106
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,849
details

107
00:05:34,849 --> 00:05:37,900
and this idea above setting up the
significance

108
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,770
and am wearing it has a plot and

109
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,370
company buys should inform if you doing
in the UK media campaign

110
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,279
chin for everything you do from setting
up media and web sites repressed leases

111
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,490
choosing who to say to them

112
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,629
what to say in interviews

113
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,449
and then novelty at because you guys are
developing new technology is a to the

114
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,180
easiest part for you there are other
people

115
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,379
and other organizations have difficulty
with this if you're for example

116
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,349
you know may be doing a disease its
focus on a medical condition especially

117
00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:09,509
comic medical condition or maybe there's
not a lot you news

118
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,009
and you often find urself really working
hard to make use and that the game was

119
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,240
there is comming

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,939
because you guys are technology in its
new things and it's you know things are

121
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:18,650
happening

122
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,860
the softening maybe he's your purview
but you need to tell them

123
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,870
whiteside yet another like give them
what's the new seeing what's the twist

124
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,219
what's the angle SEAL Team importance

125
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,279
so we don't mind how do you get people
like

126
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:37,680
my attention them

127
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,349
the point about it is that is that I get
huge mad news flowing into me

128
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,639
pardon my job is to act as a big filter
and

129
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,900
and I use automatic filters myself to
filter a lot of things so how do you

130
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,419
stand out when I get

131
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,089
dozens press releases today an

132
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:56,189
so how do you make yourself be released
on a fly cacophony

133
00:06:56,189 --> 00:07:00,199
and these are some of the best ways
don't bother Sania

134
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:04,449
unsolicited e-mail press releases and
even a few years ago a single out these

135
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:07,400
is actually in detail of now because I
think people realized

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,009
a press release is just go to magic
place called trash community

137
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,050
unless adolescence anemia a press
release feed

138
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,770
I have and subscribe to so for instance

139
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,650
I i covered space P discover so I
subscribe to nasa HQ press release and I

140
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,080
pay attention to that

141
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,219
but all the other press releases that
come in however the matter even see

142
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:30,210
because my computer automatically thank
them spam

143
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,389
clearer have the get very much glancing
attention

144
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,349
and faxes I used to take in these four
senior are dying off as well

145
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:40,550
because there is no return on the people
with me. faxes with stuff and we just

146
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,289
look at them in the waco

147
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:46,369
okay I could bring this back to my
stance car kit move trash

148
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:49,800
and its Jenny where they went really
works really well

149
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,360
which don't see it done very much and
that's why it's going to work very well

150
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,999
is actually sending an honest to god
snail mail letter

151
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,580
and find out the name of the journalist
and magazines if you wanna get

152
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,719
into Wall Street Journal the New York
Times

153
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,529
find out who is the guy who's written
simmer are articles about the area

154
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,439
before

155
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,240
and then just right show journalists at
the address out there

156
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,449
you don't like to be detective work to
find a usually did

157
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,129
did periodical you know where it is you
know so I tried to work out an email

158
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:21,809
address you got a good now

159
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:25,080
is it you know first initial underscore
last name you don't do any this

160
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,619
he just write their name on an envelope
and people will be paid to transport

161
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:29,110
that

162
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,130
into their hands and look at bylines the
Masters

163
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,919
put in a press release and and the point
about this is when I get a letter

164
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,179
that actually been to meet stamped and
maybe it's like hand-written at least

165
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,450
it's addressed to me

166
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,060
I open it up and I pay attention to it
because when I don't get very many them

167
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,440
and into its kinda sticky it does
actually sit on my desk hang around for

168
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,380
a little while something for me to refer
to you

169
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,090
it's something for me to scribble notes
on and to in terms of little bit of

170
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,900
persistence when you've got my attention

171
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,290
to your being kinda you have a their
persistence am

172
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,449
it's terrific and you should also if you
can if you think about campaigns develop

173
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,030
an online press kit

174
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,589
am with you BIOS and fax

175
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,410
and high quality high-res and images and

176
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,439
know here's a high-quality and
high-resolution

177
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,450
the two are not synonymous and you know
sometimes you get people who because

178
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,910
they know every so many with a digital
camera they think they're a great

179
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,089
photographer

180
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,320
and that's not the case and really if
you really want like

181
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,420
really good photographs that a
publication could actually seriously

182
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,829
consider using

183
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,290
you really need to get you know you need
to find a buddy who's if it I'm

184
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,670
school or you know who actually does
photography

185
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,900
and then the pay them pay them some
money and because

186
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,040
of the times no people say oh yeah we've
got photographs

187
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,319
and we get the stuff it's there's a flat
action it's you know K grainy in obese

188
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,090
but composition in the storm

189
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,230
forms the you just can't use those if
you're serious about doing a press kit

190
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,290
you don't have to pay little bit money
to get some

191
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,550
and pictures that the press can actually
use

192
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,120
defensive this if you have those the
press will use them because really easy

193
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,450
or cheap

194
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,980
10 a.m. you know why send a photographer
at to you if you've got a great

195
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,550
photograph that we can use

196
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,060
and so they ate a certain amount being
able to control the

197
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,670
the image am press releases

198
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,800
you there you go again remember what we
like to write about

199
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,320
and the palace many these

200
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,410
things into the reasons possible you
have to pack everything up

201
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,740
and you can say something is new and
significant you can just say this in

202
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,550
your significant development

203
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:42,040
our people will be at such-and-such you
have to really tell the wife because

204
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,370
I it everything that comes across my
desk has gotten you

205
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,410
knows you need to do a little bit of
convincing and

206
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:51,650
to sell too so long to to back up this
new reality

207
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,860
new using the latest developments in X
just something that gives me that makes

208
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,180
me think you're not just using a word
you actually have some

209
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,300
subsistence behind so here's an example
of bad

210
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,990
press release me up the truck door
foundations protesting the FCC's

211
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,150
decision to ban decryption

212
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,270
eww be ready three cases by launching an
online petition

213
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,470
and that's wrong for so many reasons it
uses a lot of jargon

214
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,690
it you know I'm one sense yes it tells
you everything that's going on

215
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,900
it did it's an absolute literal truth

216
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,020
and but its uses for journalists no
germs gonna pay attention to this

217
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,310
we want to do is think about something
more like this

218
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,810
soon any we could see if your email or
phone calls thanks to say she SAT by the

219
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,710
FCC the band's technologies to protect
privacy next-generation wireless devices

220
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,710
Syria their significance and user didn't
care about the

221
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,390
no you want you to be dole only really
exists here

222
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,449
I just a next-generation wireless
devices that's what's become yes it's a

223
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,930
simplification and so on

224
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,850
but that's just it's a much more
compelling and pitch to journalist

225
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,400
and then finally we have to talk to
foundations leading citizens who are

226
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,260
concerned with the SEC's bad decision

227
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,060
voice our pages by launching a petition
now I'm saying is a call to action and

228
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,680
trainee

229
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,090
picture above the kind of people who are
going to who can respond to this

230
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,440
and don't forget boilerplate which is
stuff that

231
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,190
really simple an but people are people
forget how to get this press releases

232
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,040
and then there's

233
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,880
yet from maybe an email address at the
bottom I need to know actually love

234
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,070
blocking about the organizations that
when I'm writing the article

235
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,560
and I'm you know stuck being useful
information as my editors

236
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,770
want to see it in my interest in muncie
in the article

237
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,490
and I need to have all that little bit
of have information there you know the

238
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,070
full name of the organization where its
headquarters and so on

239
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,530
you should also when you are sending out
am

240
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,290
press releases you need to put a contact
person

241
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,410
on those and have so many dedicated
which means you need

242
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:49,430
a cell phone number or phone number that
people can call

243
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,350
and they will get a response within the
hour like you're saying in a press

244
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,710
release and its news and so you need to
be

245
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,230
you know serve getting into press
release mode

246
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,610
so you need to be able to return
people's calls really fast I mean it

247
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,440
email address

248
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,670
is kinda vague killer cuz I see an email
address that person scale

249
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,790
okay well a really care about your email
that but I know that maybe I will get a

250
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,180
response to tomorrow and then this 3d
thing

251
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,280
if i'm looking for. story to drop into
something and i got an 80

252
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,740
as happens I've got to find something in
12 hours am

253
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,760
any phone numbers need to be able to
talk to people really fast if you're

254
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,500
serious but Press leases

255
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,560
you need to set up kinda Press number

256
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,450
the person who's going to respond to
this and otherwise perhaps he said your

257
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,450
press release at an annual see all these
emails

258
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,320
and then you call them back go yeah we
just got another story or something on

259
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,940
and dealing with the press these days
especially the county compressed media

260
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:42,460
cycle

261
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,540
that the media has gone is is a lot
about speed

262
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:50,469
the way is rounding up the journalists
game all in one place

263
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,680
and get into event so bribery it's great

264
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,020
and you know we can if we can accept
gifts normally but we can't

265
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,650
eat all you can supplies and what's also
good if you are having a conference or

266
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,490
event

267
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,330
it can be useful to have like a special
especially area just just so they can

268
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,400
sit down a plug in a laptop it's a
wonderful copy

269
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,240
again a lot of my colleagues and I
thought this to you media has affect

270
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,310
our jobs as well sometimes when I go to

271
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,550
to an event I for some I'm working at 12
hours during the day

272
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,240
can really pic issues not to go to a
conference because I feeling tired

273
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,490
because it really hungry

274
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,210
you know I I usually do work much harder
when I'm on the road

275
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,970
and that otherwise and it's nice to have
maybe some recon just plugin

276
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,110
my laptop and then my video camera and
then my you note is recorder I may be

277
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,580
file some company from the ground
because nowadays

278
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,610
and we do that if you say to journalists
hey we'll have

279
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:47,210
your place the field they're just that
much more likely to come

280
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,090
am make sure that they can get to the
key people if you've had a press release

281
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,730
with my four people

282
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,060
they need to be able to to talk to them
either at a press conference

283
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,800
which is just press only or there's a
consumption media bill

284
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,050
media availability at the end a little
bit one-on-one time

285
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,360
don't want yes you are you sure this
competing with

286
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,700
and if you have any General Conference
your channel attendees

287
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,150
and because they often have different
types of questions that they might want

288
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,910
to ask

289
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,740
and they also want to be able to talk to
people directly they want to be able to

290
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,880
ask a question

291
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,550
you get a response back your person so
they can write or saying the copy

292
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,440
in response to a question from Discover
Magazine

293
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,710
so-and-so said because that makes their
copy stand out a little bit better

294
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,290
otherwise if you don't do that then
every casper's realizes well I've got

295
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,719
exactly the same thing every other press
person maybe this event has

296
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,610
and they know then and the editors gonna
know that and again that's that's not

297
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,820
something that's gonna say yeah yes boss
this article is new

298
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,900
the fresh stuff and stuff you'll only
find inner version

299
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,230
and when you do give interviews I would
say

300
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,750
don't give it his off-the-cuff unless
you've already done a few and

301
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,779
where you're at a press event and is
somebody who's your some hearings you up

302
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,470
and says hey I'm from you know Village
Voice run from something else

303
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,370
and I would like to talk to you about
something and

304
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,170
they may have reach you for a number of
reasons one you may have sent out a

305
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,160
press release

306
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,360
and in which case then you may be
expected to do too quick off the cuff

307
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,640
but

308
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,580
if you're involved in some story and
they have figured out the revolt in some

309
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:22,850
way

310
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,250
have tracked you don't give you a call I
would say don't

311
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,400
doing me to do it find out what they're
working for say

312
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,910
luck you know i mean busy room I have to
go to meeting and then

313
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,370
ask if you can call back and coming back
is great because

314
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,830
then you can get your this phone number
and with some time which at times can be

315
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,440
handy

316
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,029
you want some sort of contact detail and
them as well

317
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:47,480
and then sit down and think for a few
moments preparers and talking points

318
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,460
against think back to all those

319
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,290
things we talked about earlier you know
what its significance what is the

320
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,240
contact since

321
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,660
context and so on realized I'm only
going to get one or two points

322
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,959
realistically across what really do I
need to get across

323
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,170
relief try and focus yourself down

324
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,459
them you know if you find that you've
said

325
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,680
person comes up and says yeah i wanna
talk to you about you know

326
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,930
0 kevin Mitnick or something like this:
I mean that's fine you can talk to that

327
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,939
but if the questions like stray away and
it goes from well what do you think

328
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,839
about you know kevin Mitnick to

329
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,339
you know so how is theoretically
speaking how would you break into the

330
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:24,958
white house

331
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,120
your computer's and thats meryl only
getting me into believing they are you

332
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,530
may wanna say

333
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,430
well you to be a jerk about it he may
say well I I can't really comment about

334
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:34,690
that

335
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,809
to be fair to say you like and comment
about that if you give a lot of other

336
00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:38,600
stuff

337
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,670
and you know it's fine and prepare
talking points write them down

338
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,630
sometimes they also get people say yes
I'd love to talk to my email address is

339
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,480
so and so we can do wire C or something
like this:

340
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,140
and we've really hate those and for a
number of reasons it's kinda kills so it

341
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,790
doesn't let us ask followup questions
very easily we can understand to

342
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:01,420
and it really is much better if you
please do phone interview

343
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,559
and don't set your conditions for an
interview so for instance there's a

344
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,450
certain

345
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:09,559
am free software famous we suffer
develop

346
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,830
who kinda insists that when you talk
with an X operating system

347
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,179
he is a phrase you know gnu/linux
operating system

348
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,340
an the point about why that why that is
weird because journalists that are

349
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,059
divided into three parts

350
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,180
their journalists who understand very
very much

351
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:29,059
bus complicated rules to understand very
much about beginning the next thing

352
00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:32,070
and agree with them and so therefore we
refuse it anyway

353
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,419
their journalists who understand the
unique thing and disagree with them

354
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,090
and you know what they're not going to
do it that way if you're sending a

355
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,730
Polish can

356
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,010
conditions there you know that's not
going to work for them because they've

357
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,070
made that decision

358
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,230
and three you talking to journalists who
don't know what the hell

359
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,500
you know this can you explain is and so
therefore are now scared

360
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,880
and I may be no one to talk to you soon
try setup setup weird in

361
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,630
we am conditions and certainly you know
don't expect it to be seen things like

362
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,330
to show me the questions afterwards are

363
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,800
give me all your questions up front to
its okay to get lady what operation talk

364
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,470
about

365
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,400
and and don't expect you to see to be
able to review

366
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,600
and you know the quotes afterwards some
journals to decide

367
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,130
source if you will send you the courts
are going to use and

368
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:17,100
most of us do we do system like a
discover we do fact checking system

369
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,250
which is actually

370
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,630
am pretty rigorous where you will get a
call after I Vinci to you

371
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,360
you get a call for a fact checkers a few
days later a few weeks later

372
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,840
who will say so generally did you say
this and what they're doing is trying to

373
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,040
extract the facts and

374
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,030
echo back to you but you're not going to
seize your quote exactly so don't don't

375
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,990
systems

376
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:39,090
and beat on a stupid questions and the
reason I put that in quotes is because

377
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,500
so for example my deed is space I've
been covering it for about 10 years so

378
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,370
you know when I think in a little bit
about and space technology

379
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,110
and among other things but nonetheless
the if i'm talking to

380
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:55,490
a guy rocket scientist and my first
question is so

381
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,610
you know so what is left of or explain
left of our younger and a surreal basics

382
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,910
i'm concerned. that because I need those
kinda quotes

383
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:09,260
for my audience you know you how does
this work at hand maybe even at school

384
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,270
so server firm to is a server for me
exactly

385
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:16,600
not yet be to leak IBM's needed giant

386
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,040
web farm and that's a fact because this
guy can issue you can even

387
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,200
your defenders practically but I'm gonna
ask you

388
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,760
back what a server for miss because I
want you to explain your own words

389
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,030
because maybe I can get

390
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,260
a quote have it and that I can use so

391
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,900
you know me the me so much stupid
questions but but but just be tolerant

392
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,750
of them

393
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,340
am

394
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,110
are you so dues to speak slowly and
clearly

395
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,540
which as you may have noticed something
I don't always yes really good at

396
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:52,139
but you do just tryin speak you really
take breath slow yourself down

397
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,010
and again try to take your answers to
the tournament title to the journalist

398
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,290
and their audience and keep notes if you
can record the conversation that that's

399
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,809
great you can get like a little and

400
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,428
dangle from Radio Shack two boxes and
induction earphone that you could plunge

401
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:08,309
pretty much any

402
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:11,860
telephone and you can just take that
assume that you're being accorded to

403
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,330
state laws vary

404
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,178
and but certainly in New York State only
one party to recording has to know

405
00:21:17,179 --> 00:21:19,550
that's been recorded for the recording
to be legal

406
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:23,159
and and I routinely tape lot of my stuff
and

407
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,770
just to cover my own ass and me and mimi
is as for a new keeping

408
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,260
and exercise and I'll get sir my
computer

409
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,370
again suffocation not a crime raft
actors in a precision

410
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,630
and what I mean by that is that
sometimes people really get hung up

411
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,890
on the details and they can get again

412
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:45,179
very very upset about it so you know
they'll say

413
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,020
you know you're talking about about
protocol and I wanna tell you that it

414
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,540
doesn't use TCP is you DP

415
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,970
you know try it is a matter its just
traffic moving over the network that's

416
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,990
all you have to say

417
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,280
you know you don't it doesn't really it
is really matter and

418
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,629
great thing to do really great thing to
do that doesn't happen enough

419
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,660
is about the individual a tenth
conversation you say

420
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,770
hey you know who else to be great to
talk to joe shmoe

421
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,330
are you know chain blocks good doctor am

422
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,960
that is great because one you've also
help to you know again

423
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,010
maybe guide the journalist toward
somebody you like them

424
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,300
to talk to who are maybe also has has
has is gonna

425
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,760
push for your gentle more and to you
also

426
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,370
major self you've done something nice to
your list and they will

427
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,400
think know there's a great person
election no sir field who knows

428
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,090
contacting those people

429
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,470
and you become more than just a one-time
source you're more likely to commit to

430
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,240
10 sources three-time source

431
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,600
he may actually eventually come am joins
a different days them like

432
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,500
a rabbi which is I have some people who

433
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,980
if something big happens in the news and
what is some development in their field

434
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,140
are in the mob to see you I saw this
thing happening what's going on

435
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,260
will be off the record to be background
on the will have all but have chat about

436
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,080
it

437
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,059
and then I'll go media files from
Italy's they've given me they may never

438
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:05,700
appear in the story

439
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,640
but nonetheless it had an influence from
airport so if you're looking to pursue

440
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,780
the journalist knows that

441
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,490
that you know your field and you can you
help them they're more likely to come

442
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,950
back to you

443
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,290
dunes at don't talk summer no easy

444
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,580
I have been driven insane people say oh
yeah it's great I'll talk to you know

445
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,020
I am just gonna drive to the airport and
then we can do it in the car

446
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,309
and it's just really really awful am
because like

447
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,990
you know i i bird struck bad it's very
difficult for me to recover the

448
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,690
conversation from my notes later

449
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,720
and don't you speakerphones and

450
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,330
yeah that's all sorry but they would
sometimes it's unavoidable an

451
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,270
but that leaves next part where people
the speaker phones because they want

452
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,330
other people to be part of the
conversation is the uppers

453
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,889
at it's really coming kills your
credibility if you're if if I ask you

454
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,510
well you know does the

455
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,150
wonderful you can kill people and you go
well

456
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:01,510
and it'll be spring in the background
anamensis no we have no basis for that

457
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,530
you can think Mary so you know

458
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,340
try to keep it at me sometimes
speakerphone is useful when you have

459
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,610
we do we need to talk to the people at
the same time but 1 I'm saying

460
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,850
when you doing that makes you should you
should always identify yourself as much

461
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,840
as possible

462
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
because otherwise it happens is I get a
recording

463
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,669
or get a bitch knows right can always
tell exactly who is speaking

464
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,160
and which makes means I gotta go back to
you for attribution to just say hey

465
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,010
you know bob speaking and I think that
point now if you've done that a few

466
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,280
times

467
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,100
you don't have to keep up the tire
interview but its it's really useful

468
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:39,049
and don't go off in theory for
everything ransom or conspiracy theories

469
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,220
so this is also part of

470
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,290
you know mainstream media will often
reach people who have different world

471
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,210
systems and worldviews to you

472
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,440
and if you can't

473
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,420
he if you can't get across the UAE to be
in fines and serve common ground

474
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,020
if you're saying that the the idea the
consummate you're trying to get across

475
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,660
has to come with this whole

476
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,370
array other concepts ideas that are
closely knit together

477
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,860
you going to have maybe a little bit
difficulty getting across to the jurors

478
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,559
that yes this is

479
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:13,059
the common ground concert that everybody
can understand when I mean you know

480
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:17,040
so if you're talking about you know a
particular

481
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,320
copyright issue or a particular some law
that you think it's bad

482
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,830
because it's going to restrict on maybe
in softer patten's it doesn't matter

483
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:26,840
if you start intrusive women you talking
its offer patents

484
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,809
maybe why you think suffer pans are good
or bad it does matter and then its roof

485
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,030
merges into

486
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,280
again this audience would say posit that
and the minister merges into this

487
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,600
discussion about corporate evil and in
general

488
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,730
you know you public a loser journals
little bit along the way so you know

489
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,510
don't don't

490
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,360
just keep focused don't just get steamed
a purse where

491
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,410
am so for instance don't don't insult
people

492
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,260
you know and you don't say the you know
well I think you know Bill Gates is the

493
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,730
devil

494
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,790
because you don't Jahri their
mathematical issue an issue like his

495
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,990
you I've known for a long time you can't
really talk to other people way so just

496
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,750
just don't don't swear to it is really
tough it's okay be passionate

497
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,890
but don't and don't fly off the handle
it just kills your credibility

498
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:17,110
to use jargon don't insult or consent to
the journalist organization profession

499
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,480
so sometimes I get people who are coming
up and go

500
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,840
well you know no you know I didn't think
was a good idea to talk to you because

501
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,070
you're all liars and thieves and

502
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,379
scumbag said you I'm sure screw up
everything in my

503
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,429
talk no thing is

504
00:26:32,429 --> 00:26:36,799
I get the last word so you know of
people in line in the article

505
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,960
so which is it is human nature just just
just don't do that an

506
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,960
and then especially for talking about
something is maybe a little bit believe

507
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,850
the technical

508
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,400
and the ass for some documentation and
I'm not insulting you had a bill it's

509
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,490
not that I don't believe you and I think
you're lying

510
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,679
but this really helps me if I have some
paper any documentation is often the

511
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,900
cold calling

512
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:59,110
and of the round because

513
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,860
we can talk in an interview and and but
you're just one person if you can get

514
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:03,500
like sensor

515
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,059
official documentation me for your
source your answers

516
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,420
worse first of its so that I can refer
to and into its also

517
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:15,210
stuff that I can go to an Early Show as
per my supporting material

518
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,860
as i fix my you have to convince me by
also educates people further up the

519
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,419
chain

520
00:27:20,419 --> 00:27:23,660
so after all that work oh and there was
I should say this

521
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,669
enters a condescension I remember one
guy

522
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,970
and who is quite well-known space-based
space have

523
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,309
get and as at a conference at what time

524
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:36,590
and there was a kite runner Micah month

525
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,790
you know just just a technician you know
is just your work is day

526
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,840
just random I think I up so they can get
good sound on this particular

527
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,040
this particular and video feed you know
and

528
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,809
this I think it was just like ship %ah
this is terrible why are you wasting my

529
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:51,490
time

530
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:55,799
news trying to be like you strike I
think get across India that he was above

531
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,470
the pay-tv tentative talking to the
press but he stood there and fight he

532
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,250
allowed the guys do all the things you
be seen as some sort of

533
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,230
no pandering in some way our do you want
to talk to his people

534
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:10,280
am you know you but it was actually
being just a jerk took I just try to do

535
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,220
the job he wanted

536
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,669
actually help that have weekends message
out to you know

537
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:17,990
hundred thousand people and you know so
just

538
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,000
to be injured so what can you expect and

539
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,549
so you're not going to name in lights
some sometimes I've had people say some

540
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,530
he was for me cover story or are you a
cinematographer some

541
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:35,590
well you go this really is not about you
its but if you miss you have your hand

542
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,040
at the perspective you have

543
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,639
so your goal is a inform the
journalistic to come to shift their

544
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,240
to ship their view am NOT necessarily
too

545
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,450
you know get great quoted that make you
look great and

546
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,010
the truth I a biographer cheerleader
publicist publicist

547
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,260
so if you sir if you google my name and
you'll find somebody who was very very

548
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,750
very annoyed at me

549
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,840
because they spoke to me what they
consider let the interview which is that

550
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,330
20 minutes am and they were really in
lead

551
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,639
because they didn't turn up in the
finished article

552
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,510
and actually happens a lot it doesn't
mean that you

553
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,830
just with your quote didn't appear in
your article doesn't mean it in for me

554
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,129
but if you look at at the KYC away in
planned out who

555
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,070
will with the Bible's feature writing he
talks about interviewing you to get a

556
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,220
really good story into

557
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,740
really understands that story he might
in a few 23 people

558
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,830
maybe 10 a.m. get quoted in the actual
article

559
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,928
and so and also we take quotes we really
look for Jim's we're not gonna

560
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:38,370
put the information you tell us a
sisterly directly between quotes

561
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,790
and we're looking for some loot turn a
phrase sums particular colorful

562
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,659
expression

563
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,190
the week Inc we can get it so in a few
top three for three minutes you doing

564
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,220
well if you get a couple sentences

565
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,590
in your comments about par for course:
you know so you agree you have had

566
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,510
people get upset

567
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,100
me also stories get spite all the time

568
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:59,890
so you don't P bugging me about where
that story where is the thing

569
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:03,280
am you know history died

570
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,230
I don't be you know it doesn't help to
remind the journalist

571
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,190
that you know they had a story the Phils

572
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:15,010
to get through got spike for some reason
me with journalists by Tiffany but with

573
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,090
their boss by two because something else
came along

574
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,770
you don't wanna be you know someone who
is gonna be seen as a pest

575
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,240
because they're never going to come back
to you again and what you wanted to

576
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,390
ideally is this a

577
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,309
become somebody who the journal's can
come back to and they finally you can

578
00:30:29,309 --> 00:30:30,870
expect the article

579
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:35,600
to advocate your point of view or
criticizes and all you can really expect

580
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,070
reasonably is to have your point you
represent fairly and not distorted

581
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,360
am you like it also what people tell me

582
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,100
you know stir in the kind of expect me
to go forward are you get this but

583
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,210
scientists

584
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,660
and where a lot of scientists and

585
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,020
up at the end their research he sees on
a paper says

586
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,690
further study is required or you know
which really means

587
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:59,799
I need money for funding you know I need
more grants

588
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:03,870
and they get very in it doesn't occur to
them that adjourns would say well maybe

589
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,010
they shouldn't get more

590
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,330
funny France he returns a look at the
big picture is looking a lot of research

591
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,559
and you have to you know we have to make
choices

592
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,629
policy choice but we find you we don't
and I think sometimes people get get

593
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:17,840
really surprise but you talk to me
you're nice on the phone we had a great

594
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,740
shot

595
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,539
and yet at the same time the article so
came down disposing play a few

596
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:26,629
that's going to happen and and in you
can really

597
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:30,220
expect that it's not fair to expect
addresses definitely going to take your

598
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,900
point of view

599
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,980
because you wouldn't necessarily what
you want every journalist take

600
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,990
the point of view every politician they
speak to you every

601
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,500
you expect them to critically examine
other people so

602
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,700
you know what's good for the goose is
good for the gander they could do the

603
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,799
same to you

604
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,549
so I did say you have a right to be
fairly represented

605
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:52,350
when things go wrong here I plight
letter to the journalist back if you

606
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,419
search engines possible

607
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:57,000
you detective theme and in these
responses

608
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,830
and is all about plight miss you can
escalate things if you don't get it

609
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,990
but the less rude you are the less
defensive be

610
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,140
if you come out at the gate going you
are a complete idiot you always didn't

611
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,539
do any research your monkey people

612
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:14,049
he should be let anywhere near
typewriter let alone a printing press

613
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:18,230
an you know that's kinda go on to that
name

614
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:21,830
its however if you write and say look
you know

615
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,100
we feel that maybe you know the

616
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,000
issue and say we think you know i mean
you can back it up because you've got

617
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,510
you know it's

618
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,420
we think that we were misquoted we feel
that your miss representative

619
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,840
or we feel that you know on balance your
article was wrong

620
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,540
this is why there could be a lot less
defense about you much more likely to

621
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,860
get a correction

622
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,660
or something like that into it the press
you jus don't there's no hippocratic

623
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,440
of journalism you not compelled to do
anything

624
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,480
so it's a little bit of niceness and
helped a lot so finally than

625
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,930
is how to become a pundit so I'm a
little bit video which may or may not

626
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,730
work which yeah documents with my
voyages into into patrice

627
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:08,270
see if this works for this is last year
in the Minnesota page

628
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,820
just ahead on world news a closer look
at the bridge collapse in Minnesota

629
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,879
we talking with expert who may be able
to tell us why it collapsed and what not

630
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,670
sitting in a studio in in your sewing

631
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:24,670
US marriages up to you will tell her how
to bridge collapsed is that cool

632
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,869
is on the scene are trying to figure out
just what caused this tragedy in the

633
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:29,739
first place

634
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:34,679
what she means Yorkshire discuss some
possibilities that causes Steven Kass is

635
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,429
the editor

636
00:33:35,429 --> 00:33:38,789
up Discover Magazine Stephen thank you
so much for joining us

637
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:41,940
here your thoughts on the possible cause

638
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,279
love this tragic collapse well I think
it's important to say that right now

639
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,070
we don't know passing out I wait six
hours might might might

640
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,809
medal glory am so few things happen
there was have had my end up talking on

641
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:57,460
CNN International few days of the
Minnesota bridge collapse

642
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:00,669
as an expert who's going to tell the
world how the bridge collapsed

643
00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:03,850
and okay for stuff working with them
said

644
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,919
entered is your magazine I'm not be
interview stern magazine

645
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:11,319
somebody else your Discover Magazine
there my boss and further

646
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:15,029
I go great thoughtful

647
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:19,040
am and actually you know this is an
example where I had

648
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,359
has a handy and appear so

649
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:25,869
them so what happened

650
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:29,819
walls that before the when they've been
the bridge collapse happened

651
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:33,270
help your company we have a PR company
had

652
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,969
said at a press release basis you
talking points that we come up with

653
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:40,520
and they got sent out to the various me
organizations and then we got picked up

654
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,349
a nail-biting

655
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:45,270
fuel radio-t_v_ interviews and then
ended up as I see their

656
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,290
so travel did we justify me

657
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,569
I'm a journalist I I do between physics
but ya been

658
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:55,710
adjourns for for a long time can I and
you know talk is an expert on a bridge

659
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:56,280
collapse

660
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,500
the point there was that I had a ready
built

661
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:04,040
a political platform and this is where
where

662
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,450
at so if you can see where I had taken a
very general

663
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:12,058
knowledge base I have I happen to have a
kinda particular interest in failure

664
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:15,390
and and that I had in previous report
inferences on the

665
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:18,690
the Columbia Accident Investigation and
you know I

666
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:22,170
try to pay attention to what the NTSB
doesn't like Steve really great database

667
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,200
is very interested in

668
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,160
if your idol look at the NTSB accent
database is actually really cool

669
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,690
detective stories and key horrible
things happen but

670
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,859
you have the figure out how these
horrible things happen in the sequences

671
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:34,440
so it's really is really fast

672
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,130
that's all their songs we did you can
search accidents involving

673
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,450
visuals in Ohio between 95-94

674
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:45,089
you can search that fine great severity
that shit that's just me and

675
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:49,430
so I'd interview people about failure in
general so i'd a very general

676
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:54,750
expertise am I think about that and from
the gym expertise we are able to work as

677
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,109
a general talking points

678
00:35:56,109 --> 00:35:59,380
and which we're able to then send it to
the media

679
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,980
so if you have a general expertise it's
a computer security

680
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:08,160
first things in that time had think that
means that you can actually parlay that

681
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,170
into being able to talk specifically

682
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,460
about something so it's being able to to
make a connection between general

683
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,299
expertise

684
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:19,509
with some specific event because again
the new cycle is very very fast they

685
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,619
want state they know they're not gonna
find

686
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:25,190
you know a perfect structural engineer
they need someone who can speak

687
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,869
generally about the area and I think
people sometimes are they feel

688
00:36:28,869 --> 00:36:32,569
embarrassed because you I don't know
specifics that particular

689
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:36,680
intrusion I don't know the specifics of
what went on so how can I possibly talk

690
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,940
about it chances are you have some
general knowledge on some general

691
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,890
insights which you may think you're
perfectly obvious cause a rattling

692
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,098
around inside your head

693
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,119
but are not necessarily going to be
obvious to the audience

694
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,799
people am that are involved here and so
what happened was

695
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:55,500
that particular morning I come in we had
talked a little bit about

696
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,930
administer risk factors terrible min I
mentioned well

697
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,549
you know this is is actually this whole
thing where every three years is a major

698
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:03,509
bitch collapses

699
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,490
cycles assassin so few general talking
points and we got

700
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:10,970
Wieser talking about the application to
the Minnesota bridge collapse

701
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,299
on the you know what is beef the general
infrastructure in the country which is

702
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:17,380
really are point I would say out maybe
half an hour before

703
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,960
everybody else did I became very common
parent the conversation

704
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,619
so it's america acting fast and but
we're able to say

705
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,049
we were able to mail you know producers
are yard

706
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,960
other journalists people working in
broadcast this is Steven Kass

707
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,970
this is his platform in my case I have a
thirty

708
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,700
given to me by the parent discover brown
dislike you know team and Captain

709
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,329
preschool

710
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:45,329
para discover I will tell you about this
if you don't if you're not part of other

711
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,660
organization eg if you can sync

712
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,450
credibility like that what you need to
do is build up a little bit the platform

713
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,589
and you years you can I wanna buy that
says an expert and you do this by you

714
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:55,650
can start by writing

715
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,990
have a blog right start writing articles
for 2600

716
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:04,299
so if you say to a journalist you know I
am Joe Bloggs I have

717
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:07,750
the following him and I'm coming on this
particular intrusion

718
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:11,849
to blogs is a published year has public
has has published articles and computer

719
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:12,630
security

720
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,260
and runs the popular you know explains
that security block

721
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:20,369
Dave in Singapore for you have some
authority you some justification other

722
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,380
jurors can have to put you on television

723
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,400
a call you an expert you know because as
far as they're concerned you are an

724
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,040
expert

725
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,240
again it's also matter but it kinda
talking points so you need to sit down

726
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,520
and the many blindingly obvious to you
right out some

727
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,859
things that may be may not be obvious to
everybody else so our media point mary

728
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:38,250
was

729
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,500
was still very much focused on the
Minnesota bridge collapse

730
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,069
and have very specific details had a
bitch fell which nobody can know that

731
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:47,058
point if you were stressed that if you
like

732
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:51,619
365 seconds later I'm say the NTSB will
find out in about six months we should

733
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:53,430
let me be your job that's not speculate

734
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,859
and which is how I sleep well at night
and

735
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:01,029
and then I went into my general points
which is we don't know how this bitch

736
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:04,290
class we do have no its in general
things that bill is Clint

737
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,680
and that generally maybe me go once are
talking about

738
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,540
well the infrastructure this country
also is aging and we need to maintain it

739
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,470
and you know so it may sound like a very
simple point

740
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:18,900
much we do we should maintain our
bridges and we should build bridges that

741
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,529
are not badly designed

742
00:39:20,529 --> 00:39:24,029
that may sound like a scary blindingly
obvious point but you know that the

743
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,220
anchor can say that

744
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,250
they need to find somebody to say that
so even if you're saying what you think

745
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,369
might be blindingly obvious points

746
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:35,069
for stuff you know be somebody says
blind love you think consumer reviews

747
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:38,859
and the special is kinda like crazy new
cycle and

748
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:42,240
to the may not be as obvious to other
people am but it is a matter being able

749
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,770
to act fast getting out

750
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:47,230
very quickly so again if your parent
organization you really need to think

751
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,150
about

752
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,440
you're setting up sensor media
responsible organization be able to

753
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,390
respond very quickly to the queries and
things like this happen

754
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,740
it means being able to senator at
presley's you're talking points clearly

755
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,990
quickly and then having people who can
react to that see need to be able to

756
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:02,859
save some but look

757
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:05,339
they don't don't disappear for the next
twenty-four hours because you've got

758
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:06,130
this

759
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:10,630
thing I we need you ever had a case we
get some call backs

760
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,779
okay going so any

761
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:16,790
any questions release pressures in the
people here

762
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,290
and seized 3s

763
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,558
temperature

764
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:30,559
be there Mikes not a rich

765
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,420
have three questions for you a
first-ball with the

766
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,330
the CNN peace um I'm assuming that that
was in the CNN

767
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,029
New York studios yes missions that yet
little bit about that

768
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,950
when you need to do some these
interviews if you doing TV interviews am

769
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,250
it's not like you can take this
great-tasting do makeup and sometimes

770
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,680
you do an unusual for Jerry just shoved
in front of the camera

771
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,960
and if you're lucky the purse you
talking to is in the same building

772
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,420
and in this case and that particular you
heard a word got was in Atlanta

773
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,990
and so I miss he showed it to a chair at
the you know the system comes up wires

774
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,330
me up

775
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,980
and she disappears and I'm just sitting
there looking at this modern like a

776
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,620
cat's place a year the veggie comes up

777
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:19,130
thirty-seconds like okay well okay I
really wasn't paying attention

778
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,700
anything that's been going on burning a
realist are now so yeah it was it was in

779
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,470
New York it was a remote allow the
middle done so

780
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,300
your see your PR people contacted CNN

781
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,370
another organization you gonna call

782
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,109
in what was it like p run into a taxi
yeah run down there

783
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:40,120
you can see you know when I had a little
bit I had I think had they contact me

784
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,120
it's at six o'clock night before and
then they the center caps very nice

785
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,060
which they don't usually do

786
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,420
but I don't like other interviews for
instance like Fox News was like can you

787
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,700
be here in 30 minutes

788
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,810
and so had to buy a shirt man up and
then implement name on the TV justice

789
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,920
easement and but they sometimes it
happens very very

790
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,940
will you don't have those prom because
you know I'm doing it because

791
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,860
we're hoping you live the sea for
Discover Magazine that the surtax a

792
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,710
while he played

793
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:06,150
about in this press the send the first
place and

794
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,960
but yes sometimes it's very short notice
for TV with your TV or radio because

795
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,280
they're fighting that cycle

796
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,550
you can be expected to get some rain you
know three minutes so

797
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,340
if you're a large organization now
making somebody who lives in a major

798
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,770
media center in like new york

799
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,350
can be can be helpful to be a point
person to other questions

800
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,779
arm when you said early on

801
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:30,250
about using snail mail press releases

802
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,010
into contact journalism journalists
excuse me

803
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:38,060
what about telephone calls were
purchased ring I'm working on a book

804
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:42,190
right what about just bringing up the
journalists the same here sir you do an

805
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,050
article on

806
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:47,700
the topic that's similar to what my book
is about instead I've

807
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,360
sending out no I would so I was that
because I get phone calls

808
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,810
a lot all the time again that they're
like if it's appear use them in the

809
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,700
military something

810
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,650
right you inevitably interrupted me if
you call me you inevitably interrupted

811
00:42:59,650 --> 00:42:59,940
me

812
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,280
an and it's a bad start and it's because
he was kinda about star Prince Nana

813
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,040
later

814
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,700
you know especially if it's for a buck
we if it's if it's you're really on

815
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,280
deadline

816
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,340
and it's very urgent your and you're
like decided to start people times have

817
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,350
another journalist called and said look
any two story for tomorrow can you talk

818
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,049
then yes I will do that because I know
they're short to live in special

819
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:20,850
something for but

820
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:25,140
you have a little bit elite I'm use it
so use an apple snail mail letters and

821
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,470

826
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:37,380
I would really and you can follow up

827
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:40,920
with phone call you a two weeks ago hey

828
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,240
makeup oh yeah

829
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,670
you know nigga but don't don't start of
the relationship perhaps with with with

830
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,720
with a cold

831
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,270
telephone call it can be creative
warming up a little bit with a letter or

832
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:52,000
something for

833
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,770
one last cushion for use you

834
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,080
I've been reading a lot of books lately
about to you

835
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,529
write press releases contractor was in
such

836
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,600
and one Singh I see com years

837
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,840
having a list prepared questions

838
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,430
for the journalist home to you

839
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,640
do you like that war to you

840
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:19,799
down a tad you want make your own
questions were designed to help you

841
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,550
you I will make my own questions in
Sumter you know that I

842
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:27,750
you I myself make up my own questions

843
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,960
am but it's nice if you show me
officially little things that you can

844
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,650
talk about

845
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,310
you know you might say you know to smoke
and talk about you know the earth and so

846
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:36,560
on

847
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,580
and I suspect yes that some people will
you will use these questions

848
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:43,569
I mean I would never use those exact
questions individualistic questions

849
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:46,680
I'm still not to use exactly for exactly
the same reasons I wouldn't

850
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,089
about to send you a list of have
questions track an interview on this on

851
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:51,660
this year

852
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:55,089
you know they're very rare circumstances
where do that which is your

853
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,560
somebody who is incredibly important to
a cake it any other way in a mine you

854
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,299
know president

855
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,580
that am but generally speaking

856
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,590
you know it I don't think I would hurt I
think it may help but some people so

857
00:45:06,590 --> 00:45:09,990
you know it wouldn't do anything for me
but it might for the people thank you

858
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:16,320
unions this is

859
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,200
that's a question about dealing with the
press but more a question about

860
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,900
how the press sees the role you

861
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:28,210
make it more personal you see your role
the I've had some interactions with the

862
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,480
press where I've gotten a phone call
save a little

863
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,510
platforms you're saying your reporter
will call me and say

864
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,060
we were just on the phone to somebody
and they said two plus two equals five

865
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,440
the what he is that right do you think
it was too

866
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,970
was five say gosh know there's actually
overwhelming evidence to see the two

867
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,530
plus two equals four

868
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,990
and you know here's what it is and then

869
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,030
the article ends up being a he said she
said

870
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,120
RightNow yeah and so and entries

871
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:01,299
you know I remember when I saw that I
was like

872
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,370
I don't with even a modicum work you
could

873
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,020
clearly see the first person just wasn't
right really no two ways about it

874
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:12,420
I'm just trees no no I you're right
you're here she tapped into

875
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,640
what's becoming very non triggered the
bait injures used to be

876
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,650
especially science journalism as as
achieve mainstream journalism

877
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,120
10+ similar he said she said size
journalism tends to be

878
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,279
to get away but now there's this big
debate and

879
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,940
that spilled over from science
journalism into intimate stranger

880
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,770
its particular evolution global warming
and worth a look at the Columbia

881
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,960
Journalism Review you can

882
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,450
you can I think it's freely available
you can search for this where

883
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,310
you know said we realize we're having
this problem where bonnie

884
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,620
you know when you have 99.9 percent
cited some one-sided thing

885
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,569
and .1 on your side and yet you have
articles would still working on most

886
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,530
you know 64 you fifty 50 because some
matters said no you need to go and find

887
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:54,550
balance

888
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,800
an when a certain point became just
absurd

889
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,500
to maintain to right now there is
actually ish I mean the AP just have

890
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,820
also released new guidelines about how
they're gonna

891
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,060
cather gonna and have baby

892
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,180
journalists just writing more through

893
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,930
analysis in our city a little bit more
like this where they're able to come

894
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:16,290
down one side fence to the other city
don't necessary

895
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:21,220
they can actually make me again the
synthesis even more so than houses

896
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,470
and and that is actually on going right
now I mean

897
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:28,120
yeah I agree with you that it is a
problem I tend to

898
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,319
and I perceive think that as a

899
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,560
you equivocation is a poor substitute
for objectivity

900
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:38,340
you know where each just bridge interest
in the truth and

901
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,220
sometimes the truth is that was
even-handed so I personally agree with

902
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,410
you sometimes I feel still getting ready
to fight koi together

903
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:48,399
and that's where you know and that's
very comes in where 25 documentation

904
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,440
console and I can really show

905
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,830
luck it is overwhelmingly I talk to this
guy and he sent me this

906
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,890
you know thing that's been signed by you
know all these are signs or his creepy

907
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:01,170
report which is you know and I can use
that I can use that good manners say

908
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:02,430
that this is why

909
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,609
you know pounds is actually not fair in
this particular case is why

910
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,340
you know trying to go he said she said
is wrong but it's it's a debate that it

911
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,570
is still is

912
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:15,060
very much and still

913
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,529
emerging and it is still going on and in
the media thank you

914
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,740
cue

915
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:26,940
but it's for more I realize you work for
a magazine this a question about

916
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,000
newspapers so it may not be fair

917
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,600
but do you have any idea I do the
unfortunate thing about reading computer

918
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,630
stories in

919
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:39,180
newspapers and the very often contain
technical mistakes

920
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,600
the you look any idea why that is I mean
you mention fact checkers almost fell

921
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:44,150
off my year

922
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:48,300
well for how we do feat it takes we do
we do fact checking so five-story

923
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,300
you know it takes a competent person and

924
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,580
one to three days to fact-check
historian newspaper just doesn't have

925
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,529
that particular

926
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,250
time which is why I think should all be
magazines and newspapers you take them

927
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:02,860
particular my magazine but and I'll
certainly for computers

928
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:06,770
a certificate or something evil we get
Iran and we get along sometimes

929
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:09,859
because you know that Sri

930
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:14,440
you if you give if you throw a large
jargon II report that's part of what's

931
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,440
going to happen

932
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,830
and partners because we haven't had time
to check and sometimes because

933
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,900
you know sometimes the experts we talked
to her always right

934
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,220
as well and you know I I recently had I
guess the point being the reporters not

935
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,100
the

936
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,720
expert in the field at your refers not
even if you say now to cover accounting

937
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,590
what would you know about

938
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,340
yeah exactly they're they're not the X
to the US you really have to

939
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,670
don't lose the jargon try break it down
if you can send them to some surveys

940
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,190
were so they can look it up

941
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:43,350
and that all helps there are usually
working very quickly in the main

942
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:45,240
understand the topic for a while

943
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,620
as their their lotteries for those
mistakes but generally the you will you

944
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:49,549
will see more

945
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:52,640
in newspapers simply because they don't
have as much time to

946
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,790
to think about things it's also the
advantage %uh maybe

947
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:59,779
you know this is why a year that use to
be constituted featureless which is

948
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,050
being eroded somewhat

949
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:05,350
am now people can expect to be all
things to all people but if you can find

950
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:06,609
it beat analyst

951
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:09,580
you know that that's a good person to
talk to or so and that's one thing when

952
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,880
you're pitching in your pitching a a
press release

953
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,859
if you can find that person in the
organization has been good articles

954
00:50:14,859 --> 00:50:15,670
about us

955
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:19,450
so even a limited time and resources
pizza journalists find the 45

956
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,980
journalists that you think I don't
really good jobs

957
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:25,359
and and you target them and and just
ignore the rest

958
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:28,980
so but yes it's a problem but you think

959
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:32,320
the mission thank you I think one more
week so

960
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,340
just got a brief question kinda more
specifically targeted at the security

961
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:37,390
community

962
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,600
one of the things won the times when we
end up talking to the press

963
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,630
is when someone has released something

964
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:48,690
something that looks very bad and you
get people from the press coming up

965
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:51,700
to Packers and saying hey why did you do
this

966
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,880
are you an evil person back anything I
don't know if you cover this earlier but

967
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,890
if you can't speak a little bit

968
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,129
towards dealing with apparently
hardstyle

969
00:51:01,130 --> 00:51:05,480
interviews even you know were times when
the press is looking for

970
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:09,570
a quotable specifically make you look
bad because that's their story

971
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,880
right interest if you think you're in
that situation you got somebody who is

972
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,490
just looking for cool to hang you

973
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:17,510
to say no comment like don't give them
any farther

974
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:20,940
I mean because yet there's a you always
have the same a democrat no comma to

975
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,930
look bad

976
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:25,840
actually most people who do come who do
no comment don't turn up at all

977
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,280
I mean it's it's actually really
difficult to print no comic is what

978
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:30,060
happens is

979
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:33,670
go back to the editor and say well I try
to talk three guys nobody would talk to

980
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:34,720
me

981
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:39,000
and you know like that in some stories
Diana basis so if you if you think some

982
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,570
is hostile and really has a gender

983
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,990
you can say no comment on the other hand
if you want to engage them and maybe

984
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:49,250
I think you know in and change the
perceptions a little bit about

985
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,970
it's about saying you know

986
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:57,200
for soft opening apologist and if you
think somebody something something bad

987
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,480
you know don't write well there is
cancer so you can say yet I what I was

988
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,140
I was you know that exploit happened I
don't typically with it or maybe you do

989
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:05,850
but

990
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:11,220
you know just say look you know make a
point where not a unified group

991
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:14,780
I don't know what these people did I
don't know them

992
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:18,970
and you know my console you can see it
my concern here is that every hacker we

993
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:21,359
get tarred with the same brush

994
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,380
and you know that's a very simple quote
to make it very simple statement that

995
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,800
they can maybe take away

996
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,980
don't try to get into like a lengthy
arguing with them

997
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:34,220
your your miss refuse really genuinely
think you're gonna miss represent you

998
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,480
don't talk to them if you are concerned
the misrepresentation is happening just

999
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:41,590
you know who stereotypes and so on to
the very front

1000
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,400
make that your point that you're going
to get across barriers as you're going

1001
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,680
to get one or two points

1002
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,660
ever crossed make that your point just
keep coming away at that particular

1003
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:55,960
point okay I think that's it thank you
very much

1004
00:52:55,960 --> 00:53:02,250
and my card is here if anybody wants it
a client the

1005
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:09,250
meetings

1006
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:10,980
even say
