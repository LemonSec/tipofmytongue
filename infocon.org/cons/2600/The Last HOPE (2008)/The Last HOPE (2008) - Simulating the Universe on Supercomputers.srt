1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,490
okay welcome everybody too much talk

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:09,280
my name is Mike Forsberg on I'm a PhD
student of astrophysics and

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,379
Germany and on my talk will be you

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,519
a bit different from the others talks in
the morning in this room

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,619
so actually I'm not talking about taking
computers interesting stuff like this

6
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,670
but i'm talking bout some speaking the
universe

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,240
so what we're trying to do is
understands how the UN he was was

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,279
created

9
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,580
hope structures the galaxies and all
these things come up

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,399
so this is what I mean you doing to my
peeps team

11
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,329
and I will try to give you some insights
into this business

12
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,649
how we do this why we do this and holy
run

13
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,180
currently the largest simulations
worldwide to answer these questions

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,289
so this is more awesome overview of my
talk so the goal is to create some kind

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,100
of metrics

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,449
you wanna so a fourth so is some kind of
motivation

17
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,660
I'm sorry results of their recently
finished

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,580
very very laps malaysians country were
close to Malaysians

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,798
and also your the scientific output we
got from the simulations

20
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,280
and a and the ants give quite detailed
explain

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,720
explanation of the methods the numerical
methods we use to do this some lessons

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,298
so first of all let me introduce the

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:23,240
the playgrounds we're working on for the
playground is

24
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,770
you all use to a view of this is a size
about

25
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,298
twelve thousand kilometers diameter to
this other typical scales we're used to

26
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:31,619
them

27
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,530
but the other itself is embedded in the
solar system

28
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,670
so this is already size of six Boeing
kilometer

29
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,070
and you see all the planets them with
the Sun in Sumter

30
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,310
and the other actually is only a very
small planet so if you take the time

31
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,170
that's

32
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,380
light needs to travel from the Sun to
the outer edge of the solar system this

33
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,890
takes flight already 5.5

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,719
hours to travel this distance the lights
traveling from the a

35
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,840
some to the ass takes about eight
minutes so there's already a lot larger

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,399
incredibly some spacecraft and so on

37
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,300
can reach the outer thats of the solar
system so does the limit where we can

38
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,910
get countries like the Voyager

39
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,940
just approach the altar thats so then if
you look at the sky

40
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,609
you actually see the sprites tribal
stars that's the motorway him

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,180
so the most way is the galaxy with the
solar system and the of

42
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,099
is about it and and if you look at the
schematic leave so the most ways

43
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,810
one of the spiral galaxies and the Sun
is just

44
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,900
one of million stars in the in the

45
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,040
this month when so then you can go to

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,379
even larger scales so this is them the
so-called local crew

47
00:02:44,379 --> 00:02:47,579
so the mic away as a galaxy itself is
getting battered

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,680
you know whole group of different
galaxies so there's also the

49
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,390
very well known and from the galaxy in
that but is also quite loves

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,709
comparable to the Midway and lots of
other dwarf galaxies there's a very

51
00:02:58,709 --> 00:02:59,629
small things

52
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:03,018
but then there's even so this for
example the

53
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,470
picture from trauma that is also spiral
galaxy but then the even larger scales

54
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,959
so all galaxies all groups of galaxies

55
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,510
again arranged him so-called super
clusters so there's not a very large

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,560
scale already in the conceive different

57
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,720
right things those are places where
galaxy clusters actually

58
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,310
crop a.m. cluster and difficult super
clusters

59
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,040
and then you can go to the hole was will
you be worse

60
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,640
so too everything we see today and this
accounts for about

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,269
10 three times time to the 22 Starz

62
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,049
so this is a 3 with 2203

63
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,610
so there's quite a large number this is
the whole W me worse you see today

64
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,720
now though the question is where does
all the structure come from

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,090
whether the galaxy's come from where
does this grouping of galaxies

66
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,500
in in small groups and super clusters
and what does all the structure come

67
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:56,959
from

68
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,090
and earth the whole signs of so-called

69
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,920
structure formation where people from
cosmology and physics try to understand

70
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,670
how from the beginning of the unit was
today all the structure

71
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,330
actually so today we have some kind of
stunned up picture of structure

72
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,150
formation

73
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,930
where everything started with a big bang
as in most you might know

74
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,459
and then the US six pounds from this big
band

75
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,680
and in the beginning the worse

76
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,699
a face called inflation whether you was
expand very rapidly

77
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,460
a lot faster than today and during this
phase small

78
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,659
fluctuations in the danced in the mass
density you

79
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,850
were imprinted in the universe we have
regions where you have

80
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,370
more miles enough regions way of Les
Miles at different places and even worse

81
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,410
and these are so to speak the initial
conditions

82
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,009
well of the structure so you have the
small

83
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:54,240
Nancy perturbations and you the US he
worked for about 30

84
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,040
billion euros and both up all the
structures from this

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,979
and it's actually quite nice that today
we have satellites in orbit

86
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:06,880
but can apps of the unit was at the H
word was only four hundred thousand

87
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,389
years old

88
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,139
music to you actually the yep a.m.

89
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:15,639
you was at its earliest time that we can
observe today

90
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,669
and them you see this different colors
them

91
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,090
this is actually them the density
fluctuation I was speaking about so from

92
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,160
this

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,130
different colors all the structure we
see to the today the of

94
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,080
you once everything just evolved so then
the question is

95
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,849
the structure at the beginning of the
universe where the unit was was only for

96
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:37,240
two thousand years old

97
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,380
and put this into a computer been
developed some

98
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,680
models how the US would you off can we
thank review was that looks like ours

99
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,800
today

100
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,650
so if we can do this then we know that
our models are correct can be

101
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,350
understands how the unit was more or
less what's if we get very different

102
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,449
result at the end of the simulation that
we know that something was wrong

103
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:00,259
so I'm mother was correct but was
incorrect to have to fine tune it

104
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,960
so this is the whole idea of the
structure formation simulations

105
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,638
so for pete was Miss can we create such
a watch what unit was with these initial

106
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,009
conditions

107
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:16,720
and to run these simulations you have to
account for very important fact

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,500
so everything you are used to like the
earth

109
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,600
the what and all these things and
ourselves

110
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,630
we are on we only account for about 4
percent of the total energy content in

111
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,419
the unit was

112
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,530
so about seventy-three percent of the
unit was a made up of

113
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,850
start and achieve so this is a form of
and achieve

114
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,840
no one currently knows what it is but we
know for sure that it's there

115
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,639
and it makes about seventy-three percent
another large component

116
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,400
is so cold dark matter is a form of my
time

117
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,500
but also nobody knows what it is but we
know that it's there

118
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,750
and you see that in total both of them a
con for 96 percent and only four percent

119
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,270
I left for the usual things we are you
still

120
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,440
like the planets and the Starz on these
things

121
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,240
so if you want to run simulations to
understand the the unit was

122
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,400
you mainly concerned about selecting the
dark energy

123
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,530
and similar to the doc matter because
all the other things

124
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,340
these four percent doesn't influence
much behavior the universe

125
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,960
so the main influence for structure
formation comes for some from the doc

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:19,849
matter

127
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:24,219
so you have to similar it with the
computer how the doc Matt ebooks

128
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,370
so the sounds a bit complicated because
we do not know what up matters and we do

129
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,930
not know what doc ID is so hopefully
some let this with the computer

130
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,199
so you have to make some assumptions how
these things behave

131
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,330
and then you you just put this on a
computer

132
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,008
run the simulation and look at the end
but it fits the observation of the US

133
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:43,500
but that looks like ours

134
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,750
if this is the case man you seem to be
in the good fight and have guessed the

135
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,599
correct

136
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,699
conditions for these dark matter and
dark energy so we have too much we do

137
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:55,210
not know what it is made of but we know
how it more less behaves

138
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,979
so thus the thing it's like you know
hope asking behaves

139
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,659
but did not know its name so it's
something like this

140
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,110
song this is so the summations I will
show you in the

141
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,030
the next lights are mainly dealing with
the dargah not seen the doc matter so we

142
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,550
don't

143
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,919
and the simplest we do not simulates
this

144
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,310
4 percent we on this method of my time
but I can issue

145
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,770
son one of the biggest some lessons that
was ever done

146
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,379
for the stock Mata and dark energy is
the so-called Millennium run

147
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:28,729
is a simulation that was finished No
already

148
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,370
for five years ago 2.0 drum but for a
long time it was the biggest lesson

149
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,370
a bottom so what you do is

150
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:40,399
you work similar to start matter and the
colors

151
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,570
this pattern you see that this is
actually only dark matter

152
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,110
so this supplementary structure and the
sweat structures

153
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,600
your doc madame so

154
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,630
you have to mention annie's life I so
you know is only that matter so you can

155
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,420
observe this because that

156
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,660
as the name suggests we can observe dark
matter because it does not interact with

157
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,219
light

158
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,269
but the simulations tell you how it
behaves what you can then do you run the

159
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:07,110
simulation

160
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,459
and them then you can zoom in

161
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:13,790
to see the structure so this is most
women and the smell and insulation where

162
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,480
we

163
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,040
focus on one worry massive dark matter
structure

164
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,250
so on the these bars though was show the
length scales

165
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,550
in Pasig so one positive about three
light yes so this factor 3 between light

166
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,080
years in Pasig

167
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,500
and this is no in make up %ah 60 million

168
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,709
marzook's and we focus on this very
bright structure it is a very massive

169
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:40,019
bunch of dark matter so to speak and you
can see this film in three structures so

170
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,420
you have seats and filaments on the
scope cosmic weapons is a

171
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,880
key prediction of the the stock matter
scenario

172
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,300
that the Uni worse is just arranged and
thus and such a

173
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,410
such web so you have places where you
have is not sway a very high

174
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,750
concentration but you have also places
where you have

175
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,149
maybe nothing no matter at all and the
so-called whites

176
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:04,690
so there's a typical prediction so now
he's a man and destruction receive

177
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,740
a whole bunch of small little dots that
and the sub so-called

178
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,390
result um collapsed a duck but objects

179
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,600
now with more to come on the conceive
again the spot on

180
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,220
and the web and all the structure

181
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,550
so as a sub the simulation was finished
No for five years ago

182
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,570
bio Institute and you might be
interested in how long something that

183
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,269
the stakes next lived

184
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,420
from today's point a few doesn't look
that impressive so the machine that was

185
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:34,779
used

186
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:37,839
well the IBM regatta machine and to
similar

187
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,620
this we need about a one terabyte of %uh
RAM

188
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,839
it was running on 512 processes in
Parliament took 'em dismissing them

189
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,269
both ran for 2,006 you well as

190
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:53,690
so from today's plan a few other 2002 it
doesn't look that oppressive anymore

191
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,750
I'm but what's more impressive is the
reason the first inflation so this is

192
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,930
actually some lesson

193
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,420
public first place that was finished for
weeks ago

194
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:05,510
and the goal of the simulation is not
like for this millennium some relation

195
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:05,899
to

196
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:10,600
similar to large fraction of the US but
to focus on one of these very

197
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,360
massive clumps what isn't and so the
what we did as

198
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,110
we only focus the summation on this very
massive thing

199
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,529
and then sampled the Spurs 0 with a very
high resolution to see very funny fact

200
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,720
effects on the structure so this image
was uploaded

201
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,750
already a lot more complicated to
actually talk about for

202
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:35,370
million Cebu us arm and only the output
of the simulation was but 50 terabytes

203
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:41,100
and we were running this at this time
when was running on a tub time machine

204
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,690
so on I can show you how the structure
involves

205
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,220
if this works so this is how the
structure

206
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,220
them he was from the beginning of the
universe

207
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,810
so we picked destruction we've got its
looks at the end today

208
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,500
more or less like the midway dark matter
halo

209
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,680
so if too much in the firm Milky Way
galaxy the stars and everything's all

210
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,300
is embedded in a halo of dark matter and
this shows you hope for the net with

211
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:07,839
such a

212
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,209
such a halo evolves from time zero of
the beginning of the universe

213
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,690
to today so in the upper right to see
the time

214
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,420
in cuba years so the universe today as a
joke about

215
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,370
17 Google yes so this one's from zero
213 sorry

216
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,000
to 30 degrees and we rotate around the
structure

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,839
so you might wonder why it doesn't
expand because I told you in the

218
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:34,269
beginning that the universe expands and
you do not see any expense to you

219
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:37,630
the reason is that for was always a
Chenault for the calculation what you

220
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,300
usually do you

221
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,339
debido the expansion of the universe
leave you can do this and then it

222
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:46,910
it's fixed in the sport knit frame so
it's has always the same size

223
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,969
and this is why it doesn't expand what
you can

224
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,639
again see is that dark matter and again
this film interest RUC some

225
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,209
and if you look very precise than you
can see how small objects fall into this

226
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,940
big objects thus brought up to

227
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,190
in the middle and this is actually the
typical way how the stock matter things

228
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,260
built up so that you create material
from the surrounding and the

229
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,620
and smaller things fall in and rice maas

230
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,019
the subject now we are already at for

231
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,889
about forgiveness and you have to
mention that

232
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,820
every of the small blocks to see the
stops are

233
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,930
um collapsed up Matt objects and they
are called also some pills

234
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,060
so the main object is called halo dark
matter halo and the small objects a con

235
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,339
subtitulos because

236
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:39,060
and every of these halos has a whole
population of The Sopranos

237
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,089
so come make those parts of so we go

238
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:48,290
for them some I can see that it's also
growing increased in size during time

239
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,529
and at the end of this Malaysian it will
have the correct maas of the met with

240
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,459
that matter halo it will have

241
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,839
other Creek properties so this is the
way how the dark matter

242
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,260
although we do not know what it's made
of could look like

243
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,220
in on that was like system some the
scale is europe

244
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,630
again in cuba Pasig so what's up those
affective 3 between lightyears

245
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,630
know we're nearly at the end conceive

246
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,889
so at this time object has all the
correct properties

247
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:21,190
ultimate wat up middle

248
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,910
so the simulation was a bit more
complicated to run

249
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,250
so it was actually run on the you CNN
Germany

250
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,880
Copa H other be too I'll text based
machine

251
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,350
and you can see the cycle so they're on
the Google Maps some she was actually

252
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,050
look at it in a cube of

253
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:42,459
36 cubic meters so it looks something
like this:

254
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:45,510
so you can only enter through the small
cargo them

255
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,589
and that the supercomputer sets and if
you go in

256
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,980
than it looks something like this: like
all the supercomputers X look

257
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,589
so an currently it has about 10,000
course

258
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:59,740
and when it was built it was I think

259
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,839
the top five supercomputers Worldwide's

260
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:05,980
but since the new list came out in June
it's no

261
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,690
only on our place 23 or 24 some think
this

262
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,300
so but its support for us to CNN be used
this might seem to be some nations

263
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:20,519
and just one court on the size of the
spawn olmos lower

264
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,899
for computing power is increasing and
actually this is also true

265
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,100
if you look at the quality of the
simulation so the quality of the

266
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,120
simulations as

267
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,180
given by the number of particles you use
to some with the doc madison is a

268
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,670
particle based solutions

269
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,430
as Malaysians on the y-axis you see the
number of particles

270
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:41,209
and on the x-axis you see just the time
and you can see that in about

271
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:45,250
seventeen-month number of particles
smallest doubles

272
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,740
so this is a typical trance you also
have an other

273
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,220
on I'm computer science errol's

274
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,560
so of course this is not only computing
power increase but also better

275
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,139
other rhythms and all these things

276
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,259
so just so so so you some other machines
that are used for this kind of

277
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:05,259
simulation so

278
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:10,720
one person is the another supercomputer
courts protocol oMG a supercomputer

279
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,370
this is one of another spa system seen
and a year ago another research group

280
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:18,180
from Princeton Santa Cruz actually use
this machine

281
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,660
to to some lesson lessons like that
various

282
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,269
and on the lower left you see a machine
and the Spain in Barcelona

283
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:30,209
this this a.m. a machine that actually
sets and the church

284
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:33,839
so it's installed in the church and for
a long time and was

285
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,279
over pasta machine a in Europe but
recently them

286
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,769
ajami installed fast machine so these
are all machines that I use for this

287
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,040
cause much consumer computing solutions

288
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,160
some other questions we're on this
machine we run the simulation some Wii

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,399
yeah wastes millions of viewers so what
can you get out of it i mean

290
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:58,709
I said some nice pictures but because
this is no sign so we were

291
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:02,350
want to get something out of it so

292
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,510
the key problem with cosmology is it's
not like doing material science or

293
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,609
engineering or whatever you cannot do

294
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,169
any experience with object you cannot to
experiment with the planet with a son

295
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,439
with the Galaxy

296
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,760
you can only simply apps of the things
so to test your models

297
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,189
you have to run models that were few you
have to do calculations

298
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,270
a few models and then compare to them

299
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,339
2x laps Avastin and the only wat

300
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:30,460
to do these calculations because they
are quite time consuming complicated is

301
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:30,970
just

302
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,419
from the supercomputer simulations so
the only way to test models

303
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:41,370
is to do these simulations and I'm

304
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:44,789
what do men can do is you can compare
the subs a

305
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,490
this a result of the simplest to those
situations as shown here

306
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,700
so do not have to care about the details
but this map

307
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,380
actually shows the distribution of
galaxies around us

308
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,070
and I'm sudden rains so every

309
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:02,879
small blue docked on this things just a
galaxy and

310
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,760
you can see the form some kind of
structure %um so this the office in the

311
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,500
in the Sumter

312
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,320
and then we look around and then we can
see this galaxy structure

313
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,840
and this was done with some kind of
telescopes

314
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,580
and menu and above the structure and
then you do the same with the

315
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,590
simulations so

316
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,720
now include blue and red to see the
result for the simulation and the result

317
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,340
for the observation

318
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,418
so the question is no if you these if
you compare these two

319
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,510
and nobody tells you what is the really
wasn't worth watching the bus

320
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,809
but it's actually hard to distinguish
both so the structure

321
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:37,928
looks modest the same if you do
statistics on these things

322
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:41,049
they look more or less the same if you
look at the mosque is in all these

323
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:43,150
things they also have more or less the
same

324
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,919
so this means that with current models
woohoo

325
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,940
corms assumptions we have of the
creation of the universe

326
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,320
we actually can from for big bang or
four hundred thousand years after the

327
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,950
Big Bang created universe

328
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,240
that looks more or less logo uni was so
the understanding of this process is

329
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,309
squad well today and actually the

330
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,668
so we can get some races were p2 tomb

331
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,970
proof the cretins of these models

332
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,890
another finding is that was also only
possible with this computer simulations

333
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:20,640
if you look at the very bright the very
massive dark matter halos

334
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,789
a short in the beginning but we zoomed
in if you have them look at the Moscow

335
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:25,230
Institute

336
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,070
so however the density increases to
what's the center

337
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,189
and it was a finding of computers in
lessons that this is a

338
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,610
US a shape thus was was not long before
you can add to its

339
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,309
clip is on a sheet of paper with this
was a your finding of america's

340
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,410
merchants

341
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,750
and the interesting thing is that every
structure that but forms in the universe

342
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,130
has this kind of density profile every
government ago

343
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,840
some this was a finding already ten
years ago

344
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,330
and this is for this consolation we did
some stuff for the sick various

345
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,470
the same kind of dance to profit so can
we find the same

346
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,890
fancy professor to be for again proving

347
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,610
but there's a universal tends to prefer

348
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,929
song I told you that we know that there
is that matter

349
00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:14,110
and we know that there is stuck and i've
seen but we do not know what it is

350
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,429
composed of

351
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:18,620
so for sure one of

352
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,960
the next lower prices will go to the
person that to discover stuck my time

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,110
song the the question is how can you
discover not something that doesn't

354
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,720
interact with a bite

355
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:33,450
that doesn't shine that's just there and
only in text accreditation

356
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,600
so you have to imagine the of and the
Midway

357
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,659
is embedded in a in a sea of dark matter
so through each of you

358
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:45,440
in the second billions and billions dark
matter particles go through your butt

359
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,789
we just didn't know what it's made of a
new a first in a few because

360
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,100
they just intact anywhere really

361
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,970
so the question is how can you take
these things how can you catch them

362
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,970
and our actually two schemes possible to
detect them one is based on the direct

363
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,720
detection

364
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,530
so this means to you built quite large
detect on of

365
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,289
and then hope that when one particle
passes through this detector

366
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:13,320
that accidents the just interacts with
this detector you cast as it went

367
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,539
so calmly the 25 experience running
worldwide touching

368
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:21,908
for that matter this way another
possibility is

369
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:24,909
oh what a call to signing that matter so

370
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,380
although dark matter does not sign
itself because it doesn't look like

371
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,340
there's a possibility

372
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,449
that its produce the slides in a process
called

373
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,520
undulation so all of you knowing Star
Trek and these things they have

374
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,700
this so yet on to get them to see if
they use matter anti-matter and then

375
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,730
hit them on each other so they get a lot
of energy out of this

376
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,179
i'm for dark matter particles what we
could do think the dark matter particles

377
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:52,190
are the underpass on two particles

378
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,520
to themselves so if they collide to each
other than they also produce the energy

379
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,740
and they radiate away some kind of
radiation

380
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,760
and that's pretty Asian principle can be
observed by satellites

381
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,158
that are around the of so the hope is
that

382
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,980
if this model is correct if that matter
can and the lates

383
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,890
because I've is a it it's his own
ombudsman to particle

384
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,030
them probably we can see this

385
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:21,350
so for weeks ago knobs are

386
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:24,520
actually launched a satellite called
last

387
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,990
so this is a summary summaries a very

388
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,360
Canada is at very energetic light so to
speak like X-rays

389
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,820
only but more energetic so now the last

390
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,629
launched his a.m. satellite and the hope
is to find with the satellite XTM

391
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:44,400
the second self talk much I'm so it was
nonstop for weeks ago

392
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,590
currently the calibration all these
things are going on

393
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,780
but as soon as it starts to collect

394
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,360
although read yes nazis then it could
see 'em up like

395
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,010
selling a buff so this is a map how dark
matter which I'm

396
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:02,049
observed with such as satellite

397
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:06,629
so the very bright thing in the Sounders
actually the center of the

398
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,710
this dark matter halo where most of the
mosses just there so its brightest

399
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,580
and the other things like whites yeah I
just not that pride

400
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:18,399
so if the settlers really detect
something like this

401
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,409
and you can rule out any other sauce
than this works

402
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,299
Emily proof that there is talk much and
would be a wipes

403
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:31,629
big step in and science because people
no but I'm medicines a tedious but

404
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,000
it's still not known so what it actually
is made of

405
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,520
so the simulations I so too so far we're
only concerned with

406
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,000
dark matter dark and achieve and didn't
account for anything

407
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,789
we are used to its own no star snow
galaxies and all those things

408
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:52,029
so these components are called very onyx
objects

409
00:23:52,029 --> 00:23:56,190
so very own it means they are made of
normal at times we are used to them

410
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,750
and you can also use the simulations to
assume that these objects so you're not

411
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,169
restricted to some rating

412
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:06,990
that not only so you want for example to
simulate such a spiral galaxy in

413
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,150
so how to do this are you want to
simulate the collision of two spiral

414
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,880
galaxies

415
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,120
so this is quite often view was that to
spiral galaxies like the Andromeda

416
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,039
and the motorway collide each other and
then build a structure that is called

417
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:20,720
the marching

418
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,090
um object so there's actually two
galaxies that quite

419
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,668
and the question is can assimilate this
and doesn't look similar to these

420
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,279
pictures

421
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,549
and to do this the first thing you
should care about is

422
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:37,230
you have to creates such a spiral galaxy
under the Sun you

423
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,549
so this is the gas components are no
dark matter anymore so this is what we

424
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,270
really

425
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,070
are you still so normal atoms this is
the gas

426
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,850
of a spiral galaxy you can see the
spiral arms

427
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,570
and um the sack in the center of this
object does actually black-owned

428
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,408
so it is today well known that in every
girl expert nearly every galaxy you have

429
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:00,450
a very massive

430
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,130
McColl in the Santa and this is also but
on the simulation

431
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,000
so you can see its own it's quite fun if
you look at sonnets

432
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,330
and then you can also on

433
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,730
zoom into the I'm sorry you can zoom in
to see this

434
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,490
local region better so here some the
center there's this bacall

435
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:24,559
a.m. that works though

436
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,139
and below you can see the scale it's not
quite small scale compared to

437
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,559
to the things I so to be four so this
would be

438
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,500
to become that way for example so then
the question is

439
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:39,270
what happens if we collide tooth two of
the subject doesn't look

440
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,480
the same as the picture so too in the
beginning and the series of pictures is

441
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,070
actually one of these collisions with it

442
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,928
and you can also look at the movie

443
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:53,520
so ya the sioux to spiral galaxies that
the project other

444
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,650
so to the up and left you see the time
now and make a yes

445
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,090
so it's not Google use anymore it's
parents of times cue

446
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,669
then they interact and you can see how
the GOS gets heated up

447
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:09,909
on the fly by and bought these so-called

448
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:13,549
title features so these arms that show

449
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:17,110
and again there too Lekota sometimes

450
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:23,340
somehow they are gone away from each
other and collapse for the second time

451
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,250
so this is you know

452
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:30,760
and if you look at these pictures and
compare to 'em observations are

453
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,350
published

454
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,760
Bastos ka ba some think this looks quite
similar and these effects that you see

455
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,350
the gas flowing away snow just a few
back effective tobacco's in these things

456
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,640
so we will see that it

457
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,590
object it's totally disrupted in the end
some know they're quite nearby

458
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,380
and other things just blow away

459
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,570
so this means

460
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,040
we can also simulate these objects quite
well and they also

461
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,520
quite well agree with the observation
although the some lessons a lot more

462
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,860
complicated to do than that

463
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,169
talk not only some lessons because the
the gas physics on this period for sex a

464
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:07,850
lot more

465
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:14,850
complicated actually came

466
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:18,920
so said

467
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,410
since i such an hour some of the some
rest and some of the result the

468
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,080
questions

469
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,340
how do you do this I mean you have to
have a poss computer

470
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,160
but of course you also have to suffer
somebody who writes the coat for this

471
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,790
and the courts look quite tricky and um

472
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,590
this fire will focus on one aspect of
the programming namely on the

473
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,580
programming

474
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,030
of coat that does the dark matter and
dark energy only some lessons

475
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:46,220
so I will not show you how to some red
stars or

476
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,490
gas or something the spot for the
millennium simulation and the sick

477
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,020
person is and how they were done

478
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,040
the saloon will show you in the next
lights so this is

479
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,230
just no excuse of just like that the
tells you

480
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:01,910
how firm what Kosmos Koss malaysians
currently come to

481
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:06,530
so that many two parts on the left hand
side there's the crafty

482
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,680
so hope things are attracted by gravity
on the right hand side

483
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,770
you see the hydrodynamic so there's
other the baryonic components the Starz

484
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,980
the gas you can see there are lots of
things in this hot

485
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,850
number think that that play a role and
them

486
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,210
as it was before this the more
complicated part so I will focus on the

487
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,360
on the left part of the travel team
because doc not only

488
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,130
and expect property so it's its and
prints were quite some

489
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:36,300
a simple to assemble it compare to the
guest physics so

490
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,180
became so how do you do this you know

491
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,680
you have lots of doc not around you and
now you want to some letters in the

492
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,490
computer so what you do is you

493
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,790
sumatran the dark matter particles

494
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,300
in the in the simulations we have lots
of particles and they

495
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,200
give you the the dark matter density
field and I'm

496
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,100
so what you have to do you have to
follow though the most of these

497
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,820
particles

498
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,629
and this is than a quite complicated
system of equations

499
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:11,210
because if and those of you familiar
with time integration and the question

500
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,680
of

501
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,780
motions know that this is the system of
three and coupled differential equations

502
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:20,889
and this makes its above complicated so

503
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:25,080
the code we use for this is saddam our
in-house causes the so-called gets

504
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,949
accordance

505
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,080
publicly available so impressed but can
condone it from the site

506
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,120
simply a bad round so this code was used
for this millennium simulation

507
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,490
it was also used for the various
Malaysian it's a stomach C code in this

508
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,540
country but some diff

509
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,790
five thousand lines and them

510
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,600
as a total beast coats run on
supercomputers through

511
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,080
so we have to paralyze them and that's
just 'em stunned out

512
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,580
MPI possession and I'm

513
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,669
it also needs to FTW also this library
for doing fast Fourier transformations

514
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:03,380
but this is all your needs and then you
can compile it in principle

515
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,230
also on your laptop and play but the
Rumford so

516
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:12,600
I told you that we model the dark matter
by these particles

517
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,990
so what you have to do you have to
integrate the questions of motions of

518
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,830
the particles

519
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:21,980
so those of you not familiar with
physics can just see these equations as

520
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,680
the equations that describe you how a
sub particle moves from there

521
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:30,050
to their so it's just these it wasn't
just tell you hope the particles move

522
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:33,730
so and you have to solve these the
questions

523
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,160
with the computer and for the

524
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,510
experts in menu so you have to be a bit
careful you cannot use

525
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,850
the stun government owning potential you
have to introduce some kind of

526
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:49,220
what is called softening the reason why
you have to introduce the softening

527
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,929
is because if you do not introduce a
bill you do not model the dark matter

528
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:54,890
correctly so the softening is needed to

529
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,670
summit the dark matter and the way it
behaves so

530
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,720
you have to stuff these equations and
the problem is that the number of

531
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,300
particles who needs to do a proper
stimulation

532
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,610
must be very high so this is the
so-called lots and problem

533
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,730
and this makes the simulation so
expensive so

534
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,640
you can do some initiative 10 not 20
particles you have to use

535
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,130
at least 10 to the 60 total sum sum 10
million or

536
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,420
billion particles to get a proper a
presentation and this makes it

537
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,440
quite time consuming so

538
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,730
what you need to do to use of Hope
article moves as you have to

539
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,730
catlett hold the forces on these
particles as

540
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,790
so the same here you have one particle
the right one

541
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:45,730
that isn't bad but lots of other
particles the green ones and now this

542
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,420
but one

543
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,080
interacts with all the free ones this
gives

544
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,220
foreign particles than and interactions
for example but no you go to a different

545
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,230
particle

546
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,960
and then again it has and interactions
with the other particles

547
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,410
so this gives you and the and and and
square problem I'm

548
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,270
those of you familiar with computer
science know that and spread problems

549
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:06,870
like whites

550
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:11,480
about because if you increase the number
of particles by a factor of 10 you

551
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,890
increase the computing time by a factor
of 100

552
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,040
so this is it's not what you wanted slip
like

553
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,040
the same look for sorting algorithms you
do not want to sort algorithm that

554
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,139
if you want to sort 100 numbers that
takes or

555
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,490
and then went to some one thousand did
not want that the algorithm takes 1/2

556
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,900
times longer for the

557
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,669
one thousand compared to the one hundred
so fans questioning Zaveri

558
00:32:32,669 --> 00:32:37,190
about scaling so the question is can we
get bet on

559
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,330
and the answer is yes so they are in
principle two different methods to

560
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,439
calculate the forces in a more efficient
way

561
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,830
so the first way is arm

562
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:53,090
to use a particle mass method so these
methods of for example very well-known

563
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,830
form

564
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,100
for any gas emissions for example but
can also apply them to the start

565
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
medicine lessons

566
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,950
so what you exploits with with using
this method is actually that the

567
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,010
equations

568
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,470
for the forces a very simple and for
your space

569
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,830
so who refuse familiar with for your
transformation in things like this

570
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,200
okay so some Sophia spaces just

571
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,030
arson explained you have from a function
for example

572
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,610
F function of the position affects menu
comes transform dysfunction and

573
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:27,850
different function

574
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:31,410
that is think of free space and has some
different burners properties in this

575
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,540
point space

576
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,050
and what you can do you can transformed
the force the questions to this free

577
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,149
space

578
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,440
and can be solved very easily just by
arm pain

579
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,070
this for a transformation and is
actually was exploited in this method

580
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,370
so the only thing you have to do it you
have to do a very large spiral

581
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,020
for a transformation so this is the
complication but its

582
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,620
the method itself is very fast and this
is the pro

583
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,240
but also some cons namely that showed in
the beginning this movement and in some

584
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,360
lesson 1 p.m.

585
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,820
something and you saw that there are
lots of different scales so there are

586
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,770
reasons why you have

587
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,060
nearly no doubt not on your fridge is
way off lots and lots of dark matter

588
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:13,719
so ideally you want to someplace that
has a high resolution in the region

589
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,570
where you have

590
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:18,000
lots of things going on so whether it's
lots of dark matter anyone to lower

591
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,960
resolution of causing the region's worst

592
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,590
just know that matter setting in the
whites and this is a problem with the

593
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,149
crypt

594
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,290
because a few imagine a regular group
for example in two dimensions

595
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,969
then you have the same resolution up
excuse point so the grid size is always

596
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,790
the same at each point in this means

597
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,230
it has the same resolution so if you
want no at some point very high

598
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,070
resolution

599
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,669
and you have to increase the size of the
crips in total

600
00:34:42,668 --> 00:34:46,899
but those of you who worked with the
Fourier transform know that

601
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,000
increasing the size of South Africans
from is quite expensive so best certain

602
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,030
natural limit due to computational power

603
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,070
to count increased this into the laps so
this method so to speak lacks

604
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,140
the resolution between low resolution
high resolution regions

605
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,210
so we have problems resolution with us
method

606
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:10,100
although it's quite fast so the way to
come around this

607
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,130
to get the resolution done is using a
different reckons actually quite simple

608
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,220
so when out if you remember pictures
shot in the bigger beginning with the

609
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,770
reps circle and the and the green ones

610
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:25,410
so then I so do that the wrecked index
with all the cream

611
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,569
so but what happens if the wrecked one
is quite far away from

612
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,820
group of three months then you can just
say okay the spring once a so far away a

613
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,830
great just group them together as one

614
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,960
particle cutlet the force of this group

615
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,020
to the right one to just make some kind
of group building and then the number of

616
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,420
particles such big producers because you
only have to come for the group

617
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:50,150
so with soon as particles of our way you
just drop them

618
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,350
and then it's looks then you do not have
to account for

619
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,410
and square up but only for and look and
and is a quite good scaling and love

620
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,410
them

621
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,589
so that is of course not let me know
because linear scaling would be and but

622
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:02,220
you have

623
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,250
reduce the and squir at least to the
slalom so all of you are familiar with

624
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,900
and look and scaling

625
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:12,390
from sorting algorithms who's familiar

626
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:15,890
up very good so it's just a better
scaling

627
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,220
with and understand square and these
methods are called

628
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,760
tree other resins and they outscored 30
griffin's because

629
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,220
if you look at the structure if you
propose particles than it looks in the

630
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:27,600
and

631
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,480
like like a tree some think this

632
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,740
so into the best way it's just a
combined these two methods to combine

633
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,740
the part nice

634
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,000
with a tree so use the tree and the
regions where you want to have high

635
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,040
resolution

636
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,380
and you use the mass in the regions
where do you do but not meet this high

637
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,300
resolution

638
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,510
and this is than call outs tree p.m. so

639
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,609
Tree Park to match my foot and this is
today one of the standard techniques to

640
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:54,279
do these

641
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,089
dock but as Malaysians so also the
millennium and 26 hours from

642
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:02,720
used exactly Majlis this flights to
calculate the whole that matter

643
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm evolution so it's you some try to
understand the details it's just about

644
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,020
you split the force in short rates and
the long rains and the short rinsed you

645
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,810
use the tree

646
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,150
and the long-range cue use the bottom
ash mud and is quite efficient and quite

647
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,870
fast

648
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:22,150
and is also quite accurate so it's

649
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,150
country one of the best ways to do the
simulations

650
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:29,490
um once you have the forces them

651
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,820
you have to think about how to you both
the system forward in time

652
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,890
imagine you know if the force thats
acting on the particle

653
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,890
so this work force will try to both the
particles for example a sudden

654
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,500
directional push the way or

655
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,600
him bullets of course its protection
supported in a certain direction

656
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,210
then this particle will follow this
force so

657
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,010
as soon as time goes on this particle
will follow the falls in followunfollow

658
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:57,140
so the scope the time integration you so
you have to

659
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,879
write the code in a way that as soon as
a force acts it has to do with the

660
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,720
particle

661
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,730
during time and the time integration

662
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:08,290
is and these kind of some listening
quite critical thing

663
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:11,620
so those of you who dis

664
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:16,000
I'm any kind of numerical integration so
that different schemes to integrate

665
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,770
functions or differential equations

666
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:23,730
know that there are lots of methods out
there but one method is very

667
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,020
wells use for this kind of applications
it's the so-called

668
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:30,390
leapfrog scheme so

669
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,350
the defrag scheme is a a second-order
integrator

670
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:38,009
and though it has the very nice property
that its symplectic

671
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:41,400
so what you see here is hold the
positions are advanced and how the

672
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,170
velocities of arms 2 X's the position
and V is the velocity

673
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,880
and you see how the arts and I'll 30 is
the time step of the simulation

674
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,180
and you see how the things I'm just gets

675
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,129
advanced by the scheme and has a total
the symplectic property is the most

676
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,000
important thing and symplectic

677
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,130
this seems to be quite complicated work
but it's for the

678
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,320
easy to understand what it means say
visa two different integrations thumb

679
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,010
here so the up to

680
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:13,370
a ficus are done with a stunned out to
integrate up that is very

681
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,190
of used and numerical signs

682
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,560
and you can see the left-hand figure
shows you the energy of the system

683
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,960
well apart a particle is orbiting romp
another particle and this shows you that

684
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,980
I T

685
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:29,470
so from physics we know that the energy
should be constant

686
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,760
overtime this is just a physical of the
law of energy conservation

687
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
but to see that the energy dressed in
this thing so this is very about

688
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,080
because you have an interest does not
physical it's just not pure America

689
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,390
effect

690
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,730
so but if you then look to the lol to
figures that is actually what we use the

691
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:49,880
lead from you see that the there's no
NXT

692
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,120
shift at also there's no secular an
issue I'm shift and does them popping

693
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,859
so we do not want but the energy of a
system that's wrong we want the whole

694
00:39:57,859 --> 00:39:59,109
time for Creek Energy

695
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:04,279
and this is what we actually use this
agree with him

696
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,890
ok and I'll come or into the end of my
arm talks

697
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,790
so I told you that this gets scores
actually freely available so you

698
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,230
could come up with the idea that you
want to see my hips the suit the

699
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,850
universe

700
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:20,109
on your laptop so principle this
possible

701
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:23,870
because you cannot do it with that was
in Houston and with that

702
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,160
quality like on supercomputers but you
can

703
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,700
to moralistic sector the same
calculation we did for this millennium

704
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,440
of for the servers from

705
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,450
using this public available coat so

706
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:40,080
the coat comes with some examples

707
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,080
so a sucker for example the spear of
colliding galaxies

708
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,549
and this is included in this coats so
that doesn't example

709
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:52,250
initial conditions file and dozens
example param to file a make file

710
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:56,210
that generates this some rest code and
then you can run it on the

711
00:40:56,210 --> 00:40:59,990
on a laptop and the same the discussions
on all the settings they are done in a

712
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,550
way that

713
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,950
dismisses run within two or three hours
10 on a normal laptop

714
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:09,330
and the then you get the same or put
more this what I said in the beginning

715
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,770
of course not but quality not that nice
but principle thing works

716
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,870
and there are also some other have I'm
examples around like

717
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:21,230
the structure formation well this was
this millennium thing I said in the

718
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,570
beginning you can also do

719
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,960
such a structure from motion simulation
of course but smaller

720
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,580
but come again see the the thing so that
work

721
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,400
I'm the thing is this or other examples
just can be finished in two or three

722
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,970
hours

723
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:38,000
on the left to say to have to wait for
weeks or use a the cluster whatever

724
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,280
just things in case you have access to a
pic computing custom

725
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,300
when you come of course also use this
coat and its

726
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,330
already paralyzed so it's one of the
stomach could be used for the

727
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,310
simulations on them

728
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,700
you can a/c runs on 1,024 Cebu's
whatever you want

729
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,990
if you have access to it ochem

730
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:05,990
so I'm at the end and we have time for
questions

731
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:19,609
bed

732
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:22,810
your

733
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,460
right

734
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,830
right this is right

735
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,710
you yeah right so in the simulations we
consider them

736
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,140
escalations because the index with
extremely

737
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,240
small so its extreme southern that the
cook night

738
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,530
so in some places we do not succumb for
this fact so

739
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:44,690
actually would be doing some lessons one
particle in simulation

740
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,150
be screened circles for example is just
a whole bunch of dark matter particles

741
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:53,280
because in the city in the Midway alone
we have about 10 to the eighty so this

742
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:53,860
is one

743
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,130
with eighty zeros dark matter particles

744
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:01,500
so the simulation that matter particles
I'm not do not correspond to single dark

745
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,370
matter particles

746
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:06,880
so recruit them since the collapse group
together and then we do not account

747
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,910
for this we just assume that these
groups than with Christmas

748
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:13,770
but you're right of course if you want
realism let every government a particle

749
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:14,990
than your fault account

750
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,130
for the sport you those

751
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,080
you

752
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,000
here

753
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,080
on saw

754
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:38,288
was

755
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:43,220
year

756
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,559
yes

757
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,630
him

758
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,720
yeah that's a that's a good point I mean
as a total there are lots of experience

759
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,740
out but search for that matter on what
they search was

760
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,740
the interaction of dark matter particles
with with material in the detector

761
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,900
a big problem for these problems is
actually very big concern is the back

762
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,020
runtime: enough

763
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,600
lapsed back from two to different other
demands and

764
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,860
you have to exclude all of this to be
release or so and

765
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,790
another problem with you mention of
course if something hits the detector

766
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,980
when they can really know

767
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,650
but that the stock Matteo a something
else so

768
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,970
people from theory just from particle
physics

769
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:29,040
theory just developed some models and
say okay dark matter should behave like

770
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,420
this

771
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:33,630
and this should be its Angie so it just
sucks and the detector for these things

772
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,450
and then

773
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:38,430
that the ranges such as them quite small
and restricted by these theories and

774
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:38,830
then

775
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:43,100
if it's fits in this threat model and as
the creek properties

776
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:50,100
when you say it's statement about you

777
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,820
yeah

778
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,319
ok

779
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:03,250
okay so the simulations do not

780
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:07,019
expect to start at the beginning
beginning of a few wasn't this topped

781
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:08,049
400,000 of

782
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:11,509
from 1000 to yours after this so not
directly at the Big Bang

783
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,509
anthem 400,000 years

784
00:45:14,509 --> 00:45:18,200
after the Big Bang this time we kissed
an OPS of Pythias

785
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,019
satellites so we observe this radiation

786
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,440
that comes from four hundred thousand
years after the Big Bang

787
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,970
and from this we construct initial
conditions overcoats

788
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:32,930
and then we just lets from this so it's
not from time 0

789
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,348
but it's from time fund a thousand years
summers because

790
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:40,150
you know we we can still up stuff this
we know that this is the correct set of

791
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:41,609
initial conditions and we can just

792
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:45,299
kept look forward in time it's a cost
sure that the simplest been

793
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:48,740
do not tell anything about the time

794
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,730
before this one first thousand years so
we can only can't let this

795
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,900
timespan all other things that go on
beyond this

796
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:00,349
natural limits there are lots of
speculations out there so they are

797
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:04,529
many strings theories like string theory
obvious things might have thought of

798
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:07,660
but this currently no way to apps of
beyond this

799
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,029
limit and the reason why we cannot
observe young this limit is

800
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:14,690
if you look for example at the Sun you
actually only observe

801
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,190
the surface of the Sun you cannot see
from the authority to the center of the

802
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:19,490
Sun and the reason for this is

803
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,660
that light just cannot go through the
Sun just

804
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,399
you can only see the surface cannot 30
absorb the sentence the same

805
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,700
at the beginning of the universe
everything was extremely hot so there's

806
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,619
national

807
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:36,089
border and you cannot look beyond this
border and they're currently plans

808
00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:40,250
to find ways to look beyond this beyond
this border

809
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,220
just way back to the to the Big Bang

810
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,359
and the smothers you so spacecraft's
that should be used in

811
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:52,970
ten or twenty years and they source than
for protester waves

812
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:56,549
so whenever something moves when you run
around a so you just

813
00:46:56,549 --> 00:47:00,619
amid some kinds of waves in space-time
so there's a cryptic crypt is no waves

814
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,940
that and some predicted and these waves
actually contribute

815
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:07,029
back or come back from the from the

816
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:11,299
from the Big Bang so they are not there
we are not limited by this 400,000 your

817
00:47:11,299 --> 00:47:12,859
stomach so that we can really

818
00:47:12,859 --> 00:47:16,038
look at Burberry all the time and test
all these theories

819
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:23,039
beyond that national and can

820
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:39,339
now

821
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:43,029
and that that's also good question um so
the simulations

822
00:47:43,029 --> 00:47:46,689
for example is acquire simulation only
accounts for that matter

823
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:51,749
it simulates the dark matter component
of Midway so and I said in the beginning

824
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:54,319
but talk not only accounts for four
percent

825
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:58,489
for certain that's very own Inc guess
the most things on income for four

826
00:47:58,489 --> 00:47:59,069
percent

827
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:02,288
but at the scales of make wheels

828
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:05,539
this you know use of a spiral among
others this becomes

829
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:09,979
important so this gravitational
interaction between the dark matter

830
00:48:09,979 --> 00:48:13,979
and the gas so well if there's lots of
dark matter then there will also be lots

831
00:48:13,979 --> 00:48:15,809
of stars and lots of gas because it just

832
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,939
attracts everything so it's true that
crime simulations

833
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:24,078
especially for example the stick first
list limited by the fact that the cannot

834
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,369
I mean you cannot assimilate gas and
dark matter

835
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:31,149
at that resolution country this just
impossible because the computers on fast

836
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:31,509
enough

837
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:34,959
but if you want a proper Hansa and we
should do this

838
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:38,859
so this is the the so to speak to follow
a project of this that

839
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:43,509
some troops already did this but it's
just very expensive from competition

840
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:45,929
appoint a few but you should do this if
you want

841
00:48:45,929 --> 00:48:51,389
very precise on her that's right in

842
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:55,840
yeah

843
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:02,840
good

844
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:11,740
said so

845
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:17,080
well

846
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,140
yeah so the the supercomputer
simulations

847
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,640
use so what we do is we do

848
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,850
work sharing so for its pros and so we
give it a sudden

849
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:32,200
bunch of particles and for this bunch of
particles that sub-cabinet the crafty

850
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,260
among these particles

851
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,070
so if you have 1,024 process as some
would say okay process have one please

852
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:38,180
complete the forces

853
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,560
in that group of particles process at 10
catlett falls in that prove

854
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:45,900
particles and we try to balance the work
overall

855
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,750
process and we also share the memories
so this is also said Maria

856
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:54,910
detector so you I told you that the
millennium for example

857
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:58,480
needed one terabyte of memory and work
for just about three terabyte

858
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,400
of random access memory so you have to
split this over many processors

859
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,160
so yes that work and yes but memory over
lots of processes

860
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,759
to do this some lessons with the MPI
standards

861
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,200
architecture so a matter what was on
such a question

862
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:18,680
every detail good

863
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:22,399
the mines ep

864
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,570
in this ablaze in its assumed but it's
still under discussion right

865
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:31,670
so for those of you who don't know today
we know that crafted

866
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:34,820
between to massive bodies X with the
Sutton

867
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,970
force so if you have Europe thank you
from

868
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,850
you can kill from 1 meter distance from
the sudden strength of force

869
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:45,299
but it's not clear whether if you go
back 5

870
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,010
gets a $5 billion yes whether this for
this is this the same

871
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:52,350
so maybe the gravitational constant that
gives the force

872
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,400
changes over time but I think the more
recent

873
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,770
results observing spectra merchant

874
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:03,080
very long time ago some objects and if
you up sup spectrum so

875
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,130
in light of galaxies overall aqui
complexes for example

876
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,150
and you can infer but some

877
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,350
natural constants a really the same at
that time

878
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,529
than they are today and country I think
they're very strong constraints that

879
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:17,350
they are the same

880
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:20,799
over other history of the universe so

881
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,420
but for this must be assumed that the
group's the rotational constant

882
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,120
is constant but it's also true that
there are different simulations

883
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:31,290
who account for chains and the
gravitational constant

884
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:34,940
so people also try this: and lookouts we
have some

885
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:38,290
but I'm not an expert on the sign
looking

886
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:45,290
so any other questions did

887
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,750
you

888
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:55,750
there me of writes them

889
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:06,390
he know as far as a no not because the
agreement between the simulations

890
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,750
am the observation is best at the
largest scales

891
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:15,990
so and there's nothing discover beyond
this so

892
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,200
if you look at the very large scale the
notice moskos than

893
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,849
the cream and get some speak worst so on
the very last guess the cream is the

894
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:23,519
perfect

895
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:26,890
but if you got very small things than
you get discrepancies but does

896
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,598
relates to the other questions on very
small scales you can have

897
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:34,440
the gas and the stars the play a role so
was not a fun time

898
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,130
you yet

899
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:45,130
you know

900
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:49,010
you you

901
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:53,050
oh that's a good question

902
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:58,540
from actually I'm not sure how exactly
it scares because

903
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:02,290
no I'm not the at the main office of
this coat is

904
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:07,090
have mentioned the names for the spring
and so is a stuff number of foreign

905
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:07,780
student

906
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:12,730
he also runs all the simplest but I know
that we had some trouble

907
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:15,880
for the sick first list where we used
also

908
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:19,830
more than 1,000 Cebu's because there was
a sorting and it and the sort at some

909
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:20,410
point

910
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:23,930
became problematic so it didn't scale
that well anymore

911
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:28,770
but I think I mean it can't tell you
about that you the hoe to cart

912
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,730
scaling sexy but some I mean the there's
always the concern that it should scale

913
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,150
as good as possible of course I think
it's quite up to much but

914
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,810
kowtowing details or but you can try to
mail you can

915
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:47,810
teller and any detail about this coat X
you

916
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,710
I'm this is also good question some
right now so I

917
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,670
and to princeton Santa Cruz the
dissemination the sub speak for them

918
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,830
American part ways we have your pup
European part

919
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,509
and this information is currently three
or four times smaller than our

920
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,370
simulation and

921
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:13,810
agreement is not that

922
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:17,940
I mean if not totally disagree but that
to a certain important points where we

923
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,690
disagree

924
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:22,980
and them it's not yet figured out

925
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:26,770
I mean the general things look the same
but if you look at details them

926
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:30,980
the small deviations and its you know
it's not yet figured out whether this is

927
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,370
just to assume

928
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:36,930
some to different kind of on america
method see you

929
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,240
the use you have to mention that for the
false and all these things didn't

930
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,800
in principle only approximations to the
correct physics because

931
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,920
you group the particles together as one
very heavy particles

932
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:50,840
of the time integration into cue in
tutus problems so it's not clear whether

933
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:51,800
these two proposed

934
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,060
discrepancies are real physical or
whether they are

935
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:58,350
just to two different methods and of
feeling currently is that

936
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,670
this is more to it on Michael
differences and the

937
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,650
different coats so this is all I can say
but there's a

938
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:09,020
strong competition in this field so you
know

939
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,880
any other questions okay

940
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:20,880
%um from thank you again for here
