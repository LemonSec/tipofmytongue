through that message about

27
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,139
or through that message there's a whole
project surrounding

28
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:18,950
and with the project there include
several different components which were

29
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,870

used good lowest

179
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,449
good resource information is available
to you day

180

open source use combination

182
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:03,559
for was years it was

183
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,360
home funds and resources outline for you

184
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,829
the judgment

185
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,009
spray-dried was product called

186
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,100
past equip

187
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,240
earlier was you also

188
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,540
peachtree resources agree were

189
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:31,019
organizations reefer custer's certainly
rifkin's

190
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,160
there's tons of tools like sequence

191
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,800
which is a force overseas

192
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,499
no for 14-3-3 old

193
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:46,089
Ford usual you

194
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,160
room for resource schools to do
something

195
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,689
was probably has them really

196
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:55,868
as well as we hurt you to work with bill

197
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:59,680
tools

198
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,480
his father mother father do propose

199
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,329
this job blows report

200
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:11,410
Assad what's with the scepter is a few
re

201
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,360
promise not to the world always there's

202
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,570
several new tools or prices come online
recently

203
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,579
that should be noted the first one
what's the Bible

204
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:27,149
were you CPR this project the

205
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,350
enterprise security project is really
good because

206
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,750
a lot organizations were developers

207
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,199
within organizations are people just
developing on on their own

208
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,570
oftentimes have to do comment things
when they're

209
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,660
handling when applications step to do
things like medication

210
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,850
they have to do things like organization
have to do

211
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,720
input validation all those things are
very important you have to do them in

212
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,220
all your

213
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,980
so the developer the yes if project is
great because

214
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,230
gonna put together all these different
things in a in a central repositories

215
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,279
you can grab the ZP eyes from

216
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,519
or what in integrate them into your
application so that you don't have to

217
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,579
rewrite these

218
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:09,260
things that all work is done things like
medication authorization

219
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,139
a again input validations so you can
avoid things come in

220
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,430
motor abilities that exist within very
helpful

221
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,779
um site generators and other is a tool
maybe

222
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,220
applies a little bit more to the and
over corporate community but

223
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,800
site generator essentially builds a
bunch of sites that you can test

224
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,399
an application scanner so there's
applications

225
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:34,579
scanning utility out there are some free
ones on but there's some

226
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:39,440
commercial ones like Wednesday door
askin these things in order to test them

227
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,779
the new website test them on so this
generates a and/or

228
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,750
horrible website seeking test tools on
I'm gonna let you see

229
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,329
here the West the

230
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:55,040
of prime just come out is of

231
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,620
short

232
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,240
so to them

233
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,860
is a quiche the source file free

234
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,540
applications school like sprite witness

235
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,550
you Minister networks

236
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,699
israel's simple process for webOS

237
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:18,920
right all so it's over Ross

238
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,870
my word school because a loss

239
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,880
brand funding most you tool

240
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,959
very way so well worth checking out

241
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:33,459
the purpose is good as superior

242
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,699
is Joe was funny information resources
applied

243
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,170
existing different year

244
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:47,110
who said I was actually exists percent

245
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,269
inward as well you lost higher project

246
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,730
if here's a host his peers space

247
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,029
lot lot were built which test

248
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:03,709
his people whose so we're looking

249
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:07,020
see product buddy I want

250
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,309
myspace so this is actually a this
actually

251
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,030
process is as useful

252
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:18,189
will that can can should happen

253
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,970
no sir and it was cool

254
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,909
good pro his indictment could call which
allows us to look for

255
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,820
staff review incurred sequence projects
done

256
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,100
prime lover schools and promised los
fines so what your does

257
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,510
he flexes information such through it
with

258
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,870
with third-party resources within
resource

259
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,580
tools be fun mission reads up

260
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,799
right in the plant fraud

261
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,230
he would

262
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,570
required

263
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,030
part 3 percent he's

264
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,870
Ross for cross dismissal

265
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,210
was in meetings to risk slow

266
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,679
feature word we're

267
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:16,580
yet how horrible or filed

268
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,678
we're the critical systems your
organization that are really important

269
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,510
was mission those been yeutter process
internally

270
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,710
sobil going back said

271
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,760
was has testing nice actually

272
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,879
any word you while for you would

273
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,210
water speaks with to

274
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:42,720
security very so very interesting read

275
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,950
wanna talk about everything because the
was

276
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,690
testing it is very similar to other
organizations kinda develop these

277
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,960
guides for contest or attacking

278
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,290
whether occasions or regular network and
almost one is really good because it's

279
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,020
focused on with applications so

280
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,639
just going through that guy is very
helpful because you learn a lot about

281
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,549
methods

282
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:06,730
tools you can use and things to look for
women whether

283
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,770
haitian that can meet your abilities on
is very important if you're

284
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,440
you kinda learning about when
applications even if you're not learning

285
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:13,970
about

286
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,049
how to attack them and you're still you
feel like you're

287
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:19,870
you know strong as far as your knowledge
goes take a look at that guy because

288
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,860
it's very helpful

289
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,669
and kinda Anza process to the way that
you're attacking the applications

290
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,110
very important to do those things
because some people spend a lot of time

291
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,070
kinda looking for one deep rooted issues
but if you can can go over the entire

292
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:33,960
application

293
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,620
you can end up finding a lot more things
than you would find if you just kinda

294
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,740
going hacking at something without a
method was testing I'm really helps with

295
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,049
that

296
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,049
and force you doing this on your lap or
your you know

297
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:52,049
testing environment not anybody else's
his backup

298
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,870
all of to erode

299
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:59,450
we will see at all as simply he's

300
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,550
so about awesome should

301
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,360
lost souls one so something

302
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,980
good

303
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:16,030
use in the first up

304
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:19,740
so stop

305
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,480
as well of Education good world

306
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,120
as a fun you see nope

307
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,780
with here grant

308
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,940
reserved you every for

309
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,530
here thousand dollars art

310
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,250
experience that allows us to do is that
happens

311
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:45,800
mid all like he

312
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,520
reporter project solidified

313
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,800
process weird is

314
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,870
3 losses here for

315
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,100
for review the issue said for

316
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,730
work first process used

317
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,010
process you were forcefulness

318
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,200
money figured

319
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,340
course all for can for

320
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,389
so very interesting process what

321
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:19,400
with

322
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,750
mentioned before is no really really
miss you

323
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,010
so he's curious 40

324
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:31,080
was website is up there whose million
all

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,250
probably with primers probably

326
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,909
differ based soup website does

327
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:41,659
we all know that way world as reej

328
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,870
for to use information for

329
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,140
my for more this

330
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,870
sites so a loss organizations as well

331
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,960
contribute political view of

all also sort

465
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,840
well the thing I want to mention

466
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,180
is a you want people to come to me
because

467
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,270
not because I know anything about scary
but I know people that do you

468
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:57,350
and they've come to me and said you know
how do I store

469
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,410
I'm a network guy I know a lot about
running MS

470
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:03,570
I know a lot about you'll be writing
code to

471
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,300
exploit buffer overflows and things like
that know how I get started and this is

472
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,250
really very sorry

473
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,300
even if you don't you know even if
you'll recall

474
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,830
you can still break whether occasions
nothing that you can't miss them

475
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,010
something you know you can you can still
break them figure out how to get

476
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,490
involved and learn about especially with
the window

477
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:25,240
weapon again it's like a working
exhibits just one

478
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,580
application that stands alone you were
no wheels

479
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,350
and it has with occasional abilities you
can go and you can use the almost

480
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,630
testing guide to guide you through how
to attack

481
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:40,370
wet weather to those things well you
know and as well as the tools

482
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,040
you know that's it that's all the tools
that are there that you need to break

483
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,790
the allegations

484
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:46,980
very good it teaches you and it's really
good way to get started

485
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,150
so I definitely recommend it and if or

486
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:57,150
questions

487
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,980

488
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,340

up

507
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,180
yeah I know thing to keep in mind about
the OL sperm tools

508
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,700
is that since they're all open and free
for everyone in there developed by the

509
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,330
community

510
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,450
there's a %uh there's a good amount of
really talented people they get to look

511
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:50,860
at them

512
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm not saying that everything is 100
percent secure is nothing can be

513
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,780
but there's there's definitely a a the
top tear

514
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,250
%uh application security professionals
that look over these things when I say

515
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,740
professionals a lot of people from the
hacker community

516
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,030
you know kind of chuckle and say haha
you know i hack all these corporate site

517
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,300
all the time so professionals think its
security

518
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,710
but at the end of the day the
organizations do really hire people that

519
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,360
are very

520
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,630
professional that are that come from
organizations or

521
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,429

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:28,770
very creative backgrounds they are very
creative mindset and it's not a bunch of

525
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,199
got bunch of guys in suits that come
over and look at the code and you know

526
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,760
try and see if they can find something
wrong it's it's really talented people

568
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,100
us a call for more space

569
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,380
yeah traditionally we've had a a few
meetings in Jersey City

570
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,020

host about 100 people

575
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,860
