1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:04,310
far I'm from the factory Philadelphia on
factory Zack space just sort of there

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,400
about six months ago

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,970
it seems like there's like nine or 10
space is just starting up now

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,920
so we're just one of the many you know
younger guys or pulls up together in

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,309
trying to do the

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,109
community stuff on before you started
there is really cool random announce the

7
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,859
car just like circa 2001 of

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,160
I kinda like it so anyway arm yes cell
phones you can turn off i turn my of

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,730
30 cool and DVD sales of all the talks

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,870
are also available arm from previous
years and then this year's gonna be

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,040
online things like that

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,450
so if you were born of here you can wash
it again

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,629
and hope you go to sleep at night or
something whatever works

14
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:43,790
so on 100 talk about community
fabrication

15
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,010
home so mister with Mike

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,170
credentials I am. but as you can see

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,620
well prepared to talk about this I spent
years studying this topic

18
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,620
and I didn't just get instant like 3-4
months ago and

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,739
just fine if everly three weeks ago on

20
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,049
so you know sorry we talk vs falsely

21
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,570
to worry about it up slightly home saw

22
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,590
I'm I'm pretty gung-ho about this stuff
although I haven't had a lot of

23
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,310
experience

24
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,460
and frankly they could find somebody
with a lot more space to talk

25
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,369
so I think probably the audience the
police were there someone more qualified

26
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:18,400
than I speak

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,640
on if you know cut off after work
recommend one of the wrong authoring

28
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,650
software ever

29
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,979
own updates a

30
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,920
so but the misuse municipal its moorings
announcers

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,820
BBC America space for the factory so
like unfortunately miss those

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,880
talks that happen arm I wanna talk a
little bit about the community aspect of

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,520
it is only

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,539
people recover some sort of thing home
so yeah

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,590
what is community fabrication
fabrication is you know buildings

36
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,350
fabricate things out of our hard work

37
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,649
me fabrications the idea you have
somewhere you can get to do this

38
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,820
that hopefully isn't you know a p/e like
a huge cost a silly hopefully there's

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,299
maybe a changing ideas

40
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,409
it's not you know a lot behind doors
it's it's about

41
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,429
not only the ability to grab the tools
to use tools learn how to use them but

42
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:10,020
to bounce radio is the key

43
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,690
on you know there's a lot of things you
can do as an individual but I

44
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,060
I think people are and saw for
communicating Rosebery are that when you

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,940
have a big bounce ideas off we have
other creativity when you have other

46
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,670
angles

47
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,390
on the same problem you can come up with
totally new to legal solutions

48
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:31,260
on there some examples existing projects
that are sort of the community facility

49
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:31,989
style

50
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:35,970
this arm South attack in Boston is
basically a little

51
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,590
Tech Community Center they have a budget
fabrication tools that I'll

52
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,280
I'll get to it later on they're serving
the students there in an outreach

53
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,540
program they came on a meaty bits and
atoms

54
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,370
on program and the idea is you know
outreach for getting

55
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,580
these technologies for buildings that
the campus was think you know in you

56
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,739
get kids hands-on distance itself on
that's not the really big success

57
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,099
you know kids company built really
amazing cool suffered

58
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,609
that you people not thought of otherwise
on

59
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,860
and you know she's done community is
like community center stable South Bronx

60
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,050
is right here in the city I don't know
much about it

61
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,599
if anybody does feel free lol home up K

62
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,970
you know as far as I understand it's
another 10 centers works just as

63
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,859
community centers

64
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,319
side school on there's a lotta love
community colleges around the US

65
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,489
in your Michigan Iowa places like that
our building

66
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:28,659
the survey serve the fabrication lab
after school

67
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:31,700
some of them are doing a really good job
as a community college in like making it

68
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,090
very accessible people in the area

69
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,099
some colleges you not so much as big a
very entry

70
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:40,500
but on that's another Associated the
sort of you in the community

71
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,010
out there just play around on there's
also you know the commercial

72
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,429
versions of this there's tech shop on
California on their billing like eight

73
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:47,860
or nine

74
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,019
places across the US in Seattle and
North Carolina

75
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm thoroughly more Calif now it's like
I told you

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,920
you go you read the equipment on I stop
by and check a few

77
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,830
a check out there there centrist
location and a pretty cool like

78
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,780
it's not you know it definitely is a
page image definitely use some place you

79
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,390
can after

80
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,510
you know but a couple bucks on a remote
to get into but you can get and you can

81
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,140
do stuff

82
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,180
if there's a community aspect there's
large areas their people are really

83
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,580
friendly people really helpful

84
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,109
on there's crucible others love there's
a lot of little random places or to fit

85
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:23,229
into this that are not coming at it from
a

86
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,400
fabrication but are coming at it from a
craft on there's woodworking shops all

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,550
over the place there's

88
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,250
places that do ceramics things like that
I love place

89
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,410
to meet is also to fall into the
fabrication to things like

90
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,830
yeah maybe they're making things out of
plastic smeared on the high tech stuff

91
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,359
maybe there's me subsist on Etsy but
they're still there making some there's

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,229
a knowledge base their their skills
their

93
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,430
and there's the idea like a bouncing
ideas off work around you can use the

94
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,930
better

95
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,949
on I think we can pull ideas from all
these guys

96
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,850
as people the hacker aspect into it and
as we start looking like a few what

97
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,270
message looking tear apart and rebuild
what we like

98
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,570
figure out on so for the modern fam
leather serve like

99
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,419
from four me style tools that it really
hate it takes all of them together

100
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:11,210
to me I'll really certainly you critical
mass

101
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,120
on one is the razor claws laser cutter
plasma cutter

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,570
water jet cutter on the isley it's a
sheet metal cutting you get you get a

103
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,310
substance

104
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,940
and then you can cut designs outfit out
of lot you flapping in the report you

105
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,289
can stack those controlling

106
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,740
to form the motorways by Tom but the

107
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,780
you cutting other sheet services slick
tool 0

108
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,280
um CNC machines for block for cleaning
plot material down

109
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,479
are the big thing that it sort of almost
every species that have

110
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,699
on you get whatever it is with metal you
can use UT machine

111
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,740
you setup for anything machine is just
because right out for you

112
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,550
on there's a lot of layers a lot of
reading this you can get up to $5000

113
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,289
sheen from Sears that'll get you started
or you can get you know the hundred

114
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:54,750
thousand dollar approached you

115
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,590
Pro Tools example room home there's a
whole range these things

116
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,750
on 3d printers are what I'm interested
in on this be sleep deposit material

117
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,490
to build up a structural layers on
there's like unique problems

118
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,009
its chemical the other tools like your
laser Francine's

119
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:14,870
laser cutting CNC machine like they're
sort of people be doing that for

120
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,610
for all a long time has been allowed to
like that around the 3d printers are you

121
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,630
towards coming out

122
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:24,030
in just getting access home for you
since the sixties you go to Bridgeport

123
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,000
you could buy

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,229
a mill or you know for the last may be
10 to 15 using gonna get a water jet

125
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:29,949
cutter

126
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,069
and you they're out there they're
available the 3d printers you know the

127
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,630
finding in the price range where

128
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,659
guys can get image have in the basement
work best in shipping have one

129
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,759
you know somewhere we can get access to
it um

130
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,050
and last is the art runs and things like
PCP making rapid prototyping

131
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,870
on having the or transfer to build and
you bill run the motors

132
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,780
when the electronics on your you can go
logical devices with just hardware but

133
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,849
it's the hardware software companies in
really

134
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,560
pulls altogether so it's turned out that
the expertise in software the expertise

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,370
in microcontroller soldering all that
stuff plane tree social engineering

136
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,860
that's become a big part fabrication and
in Philly DC lato artists or doing

137
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,830
installations

138
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,508
coming to take are our classes and saw
for computer classes in

139
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:15,690
your programming because has a legal
concept that actually

140
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,160
bill most the rake and then they look
alike I don't know how to

141
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,310
motors or like poet to get an 18-wheeler
16 boulder forcibly

142
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,130
they're coming to us to ask those
questions answer we're that there are

143
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,949
that are resources out there and of
course

144
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,460
you know we're going to that were billy
goat overbilling is really cool thing

145
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,220
but we don't know how to

146
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,810
as meetings so there's a weird cross
convergence

147
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,150
37 in Philly and I think that from here
for other people's having all

148
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,419
place but this is the main tools that
owns that really make a modern South ap

149
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:48,650
in this is like the me mister also the
functionally floor there's there's a lot

150
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,610
of places he go

151
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,990
on things have been certainly growing
around these

152
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,680
these places are building up and I think
it's funny critical mass where

153
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,500
its gonna sir shift in one direction or
the other the bare minimum that this

154
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,160
technology

155
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,500
mean the the last four tools are going
to cover is going to be

156
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,110
basically what we have today I i don't
think it's going to fall any lower than

157
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,889
this I think this level of stuff going
to be around which is

158
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:14,810
the other group guys you chip in to buy
tool on they specialize that you just

159
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,160
like

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,349
old is just working over just
metalworking or we're just welding

161
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:23,099
mom there's there's company you know
there's complete fabrications are

162
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,120
University fabrications works only the
company its own University you have to

163
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,370
be a member to get at it

164
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,789
wish there's several films treadmill
crazy

165
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,949
you know it's for design studios
expensive tickets to see if this is what

166
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,870
we have now

167
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:40,250
in a lot of places there's very few
places we have the open shops

168
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,380
then there's the ceiling like how high
can this go the slick shoes often goes

169
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,189
crazy

170
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,330
on what happened someone is like
fabrication everywhere it's like

171
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,630
you know kinko's you know you walk in
any one for fear boners like a

172
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,480
me for wonder they'll file some report
up

173
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,630
custom-made stuff is really easy you
know you can just go in and you can

174
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,670
you can use you 41 username great and
everything

175
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,670
can add your name cut in anything a lot
of anything can

176
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,910
make up sculpture your mom's face for a
mug if you

177
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,769
12 months is a mod plea our musical
revival this year's like it like about

178
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:15,110
the potential for

179
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,339
the polymers that a lot of classic
shooting in 3-d printing

180
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:21,950
or the materials you're doing you're
cutting or your scene seeing out of

181
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,130
to be totally recyclable like you go you
build something it breaks

182
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,370
you walk back and you just like dropping
it in it behind the scenes the machine

183
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,010
comes up into little parks

184
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,120
you from i to pox Ian pulls back out

185
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,089
like what they do with the roads mcadams
you will tear street for reprocessing

186
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:39,519
alia same material right back down

187
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,100
server refresh for for more use on
people see that like

188
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,160
the local fabrication shops make this
possibility

189
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,449
because you're not shipping things way
far away Backlick right there you can

190
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,110
drop it off

191
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,800
wait an hour and you can just you chop
your coffee mug in the have

192
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,600
a better coffee mug with the lets you
design in a little bit

193
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,579
arm she customization to prepare this
for free well

194
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:05,980
on the idea that building hardware will
be as New Years billing software

195
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,220
you can go in and you can like build
something if it's wrong here we go again

196
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,440
just make another

197
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,230
home and that's a to me is really
powerful idea I

198
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,980
bill you know I've I'm kinda Angeles ok
I like to build things I

199
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,060
feels like Christmas gifts like a lot of
stuff my apartment

200
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,810
and there's a lot of times where I mess
things up and I have suffered random

201
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,950
things like that and

202
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,339
being a software guy lego man I should
be measured three times since that it is

203
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:28,800
building

204
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,269
because a software guy can just build it
and it doesn't work or cares it'll take

205
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:33,529
36 to change it

206
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,779
only start getting to physical stuff you
know those those rules change

207
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:41,589
home and two shifted more the direction
of you can prototype fast

208
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,149
you just throw stuff out all back
together I think that the awesome

209
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,880
awesome thing have on Sat in space this
one of these are your people like me but

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,420
i think is

211
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,769
Just Dance leaders like bring in space
for any buildings

212
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,329
it's pretty obvious that fabrication
technology is going to be a big part you

213
00:10:56,329 --> 00:11:00,540
you can ship everything apostle park to
mars your leadership up a box that

214
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,189
chemicals

215
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,700
its on its thats you I really

216
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,829
think that we need a backup system that
is not on the big marble

217
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:11,350
and on I'm really think that you know so
this technology and hopes that you know

218
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:14,399
when they have them a great game cuz I
worked on it was crazy guys and now

219
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,459
it puts in space in on the planet

220
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,459
goes into orbit gets the medicine under
space monsters come

221
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,579
you know somebody a little

222
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:26,990
so might be questioned fun silly silly
is like

223
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,140
does this come like a Linux users group
I like guys pull together

224
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,439
girl altogether people together they
just make a space was gonna be like

225
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,700
equals the sum the company gonna go on
sale go I realize is a market me for

226
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,260
this

227
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,790
and Phil on right now where the space
work could go either way

228
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,120
there's community here upstairs people
just you know by now that they invite

229
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,060
friends over

230
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,649
there's places like you know the actor
is places like on yours the resistor

231
00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:50,089
thereby

232
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,510
wraps turbine that Holmes letters making
tools available

233
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,600
is also a place like tech shop and you
know there's nothing wrong with that

234
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,579
they're just their style is there gonna
do company

235
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:01,670
make money home and I sorta feel that
we're

236
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,729
the next couple years are certainly a
breaking point to see if

237
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,519
Tech shock and make a elite perfor riser
place like that can make a run for it

238
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,829
orbits cancer following the community
hands

239
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:17,880
so so i'm talking about. of 3d printing
because that's something I

240
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,980
know at least a little bit about on so

241
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,480
you know the specially rappers that
makes during layers serve

242
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,709
plastic if someone sources are gonna
rapid prototyping sheen

243
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:33,490
usually talk about like a sixty thousand
dollar a hundred thousand dollars sheen

244
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,779
these the stuff the design studios have
architectural firms have you

245
00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:40,430
the big places that do you industrial
design have in their offices the

246
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,540
put out there for samples they're very
high precision

247
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,029
on the classics are usually a little bit
more rugged

248
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,300
day you know they get a lot to use the
costly to maintain the systems are

249
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,100
really close

250
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,000
if you want to do you know make
something out of a new materially one

251
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,750
experiment with

252
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,200
with chemical materials things like that
the systems of something

253
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
supported if you Janet up because you're
trying some plastic that you invented

254
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,690
there's no tell you a goal you it's not
covered under your TFTP for

255
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,579
repair stuff like that on the next up
downs like the 3d printers

256
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:13,880
this is certainly in like obvious
affordability of us really

257
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,089
you the high into that straight division
BST as I understand it so helpfully the

258
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,880
next two and a half years three years
there

259
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,529
making them as fast as possible but
people are buying them up just as fast

260
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:28,040
arm C corporation I don't know much
about their machine but it's another one

261
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,099
at the desk top models

262
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,519
you know it comes with their software
using their plastic

263
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,649
on 3 system same you

264
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,149
same idea like it's it's in a box you
know one touch solutions I think you

265
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:39,500
just

266
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,860
drop you can miles dropping in there and
the you love me and say all that stuff

267
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,850
on below that is like to do it yourself
level on

268
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,029
your fabrication stuff on there's that a
home there's Rep Raptors clanking

269
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,139
machine

270
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:56,800
arm click machines gonna be the lowest
that like in theory for bill clinton

271
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,639
machines like 300 issues

272
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,010
600 and you know that should be sleep
get their offer to kill yourself

273
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,050
you know that's the price to still come
together a little bit it's nearly there

274
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,630
instead be out soon on fat at home they
just about the generation to machine

275
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,839
on favor box it has a couple syringes
there's extra material

276
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,410
on at least on layers you know home it's
not as precise

277
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,899
as the huge were machines but you know
you can put anything you want in there

278
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:23,360
you can

279
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,370
training materials you can you

280
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,300
you can try doing things like replacing
the head with a printer hates your

281
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,529
different chemicals

282
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:33,970
you can guys refitted with like Kenny
ever sire molter

283
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,100
motorcycle like put it rena substance in
the meltdown

284
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,250
rather than extruding substance on top
players really you

285
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,060
he's open up the mess with on iraq has
the same way regrets goal is to make a

286
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,209
machine that replicate itself

287
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,850
same sort of thing you know its a simple
parts

288
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,870
on all or should you know the same
plastic they make

289
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,269
they actually did like replication 0
they took one rep rap name using repre-

290
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:02,000
male plastic parts for it on they'd cut
down a little bit

291
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,300
the engineering work a little
differently but you a record pace they

292
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:05,850
make it so

293
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,990
this

294
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,180
also three printers dream where this
could go the story goes

295
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,260
also this the for silly his own

296
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,380
you know the world domination like this
could be the thing that seems everybody

297
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,089
and you know green technology

298
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,000
face-down mass production with low class
production it would be cheap easy place

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,310
here

300
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:34,779
gets gets into space you know no

301
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,860
a sustainable local doctor good like a
local economy having a guy

302
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,980
making this up a couple blocks away
answer across the planet all assertive

303
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,670
you feel that type stuff teach our
children to close shiver cats

304
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:47,970
just you've solved all the worlds
problems in one go and this is what a

305
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,790
lot of guys

306
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:52,589
are are talking about and I think it's
it's out there that can happen

307
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:55,800
that could be what II you know I think
there's a good case for that

308
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:01,040
and I think that that some people talk a
lot about Tom web services is like

309
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,639
more like what's happening now on three
pretty is

310
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,680
is a little difficult to use its really
cool you can make some really its up

311
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,209
with Italy

312
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:11,519
it's not for you it's not just possible
and it's %uh pops out

313
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,639
on you have to you know there's yes
missus ranges yet flexible plastics

314
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,660
stuff doesn't fit right the first time
yet to go back and try again

315
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,540
it's not you know it's not just to a
simple stuff on you do need to console

316
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,089
or in the system

317
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:27,329
the software's little wonky sometimes
you have to go in and look at the math

318
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:29,769
and figure out like okay what's going on
with the Pats

319
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,149
why isn't it connecting you know like
you can press the connect button it

320
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,339
doesn't work okay we'll

321
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,980
fire the debugger a break points okay
with us what's wrong

322
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,860
you know like it's it's not there yet
there's a lot of work is going into a

323
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,620
store

324
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,480
on it's not really something everybody
it's this isn't really a blender that

325
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,160
people learn to use every day like

326
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,500
a lot of people talk about fabricators
in every hole min

327
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,880
unite I yet there's a chance I could
work out like

328
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,170
and media not for sale enough to to see
a but it seems like a smart technologies

329
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,620
once in awhile and random

330
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,780
with one of stuff on that isn't going to
be for everybody

331
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,918
you know not everybody has a milling
machinery seriously their house over as

332
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:12,500
would creatures but they're really great
to have you can do awesome stuff with

333
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,369
them

334
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,650
there the fantastic technologies but you
know they're not

335
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,850
your turning world Tom it is just
getting traction

336
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:24,359
arm place at the very base of the
billing software now

337
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,900
on on the mailing list you know for for
fat home there's like a guy with make

338
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,770
this truck left for

339
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,100
family yeah it's really good idea not
Windows only

340
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,650
is so like it's still a stage where

341
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,600
got you can get any cancer the
technology and its partners 1 I'm

342
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,429
interested myself is that

343
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:43,520
I'd like to get into it like to push the
sports being open like which this

344
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,410
towards

345
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,429
accessibility like to me the stuff
available

346
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:53,169
for help make this available you know
either with technology goes at least

347
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,179
you sir pushing directly yes

348
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,549
arm yet it does make a bigger Michael
home

349
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,350
on you know people compare to go back on

350
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,159
people like me comparison to like
computer technology in the sixties like

351
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,390
olika its gonna you know where you're
looking at right now it's the geeky guys

352
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,600
and girls clubs

353
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,429
there's going to be one in every home
people underestimate the power of the

354
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,419
people underestimate the ubiquity

355
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:20,120
you know that's that's the model on
people like to talk about is like oh

356
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,780
it's like

357
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,250
you know the Homebrew Computer Club in
1960 and

358
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,299
you know when I actually signed up for
the stock that's what I thought too in

359
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:27,889
the last

360
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,980
month and a half or so messing with
things I think it's more likely

361
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,830
limits in the mid 90's like yeah you
know it could really be something but

362
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,129
it's not there's a lot of talk there's a
lot of fight

363
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,309
but frankly you're not seeing the next
%uh stops in every sheen's days

364
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:42,399
you know it was the back over the
Internet there's lots more voice

365
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,750
me know but it's not you know its its
it's all different

366
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,549
it's a little more tactical so hard to
deal with omits all

367
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:54,129
you know takes a bit more to dig into
takes more skill to work to make

368
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,230
home so

369
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:01,350
Tom that's already overview like 3d
Systems

370
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,789
I realize now I'm burning through this
really fast so this may be a blue shirt

371
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:05,559
on

372
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,120
um so I've been using fellow home that's
the system that the hatchery decided

373
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,000
upon

374
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,340
we looked at Rep raptly really liked it
on Evelyn actually came and spoke at one

375
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,709
of the only event in Philly

376
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,179
talk to him and use pretty gung-ho and
you know

377
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:23,620
the made her decision and decided your
fellow home

378
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,690
on that home only officially has Windows
framework

379
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,400
yeah was just I was actually on the bus
coming down here

380
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,720
exchanging emails with people that like
hey whats let's make the

381
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,910
open source version the frame with the
official framework but moving in

382
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,640
who's less very thing so its
cross-platform on your tits

383
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,679
its really weird issues technology
that's like cutting edge next-generation

384
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:46,010
technology

385
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,230
talking a lot about openness making
source code available and then only runs

386
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,500
on

387
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:52,919
possible so on

388
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,020
it's awesome its software hardware IP
obstinate

389
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,320
it is a little bit hard to get to do
what you want to do it's not

390
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,770
you know it's not just for this device
you have the whole machine

391
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,520
you have to set up your ordinance you
have to make sure that your models are

392
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,090
right

393
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,199
their times were you load a model you
set it up in you know

394
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,320
it just World Cup safe to go any a few
things out like it's it's not reveal

395
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,899
but to make up for that is there's an
awesome few under the guise that are

396
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,059
you know doing these projects the guys
on its mailing lists the guys in the

397
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,610
fabrication forums on

398
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,480
you the 15th outside other are
absolutely awesome

399
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,240
on it's a lot like I guess that is all
it wants me like

400
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,460
there the rapid love the technology you
ask any question

401
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,380
and so we will get back to the dance or
somebody will figure something out yes

402
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,770
you're weird stuff

403
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,460
an average rate they're chipping in
giving Hanley trader will be fixed about

404
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,659
so it is a lot since we get rolling off
at home

405
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,350
I think a little more so than the rep
row and both for those more than the

406
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,770
clinking sheen

407
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,539
arm you know you yes but don't somebody
at what are these to get it going

408
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,850
or you have put in four different
buildings and

409
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,370
there's definitely a barrier that I
would like to see lowered I don't think

410
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,120
snowfall overnight but I do you think

411
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,840
you know every revision they do a
machine quite a few things down the

412
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,850
simplify it

413
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,460
the figure few things out but frankly
singer sleep like I'm complaining about

414
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,280
the little bit

415
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,149
but it's really awesome you go in any
you set up a 3d file

416
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,240
any you the thing comes out home me you
know we're talking with people about

417
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,059
what use is we can put this to

418
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,480
sales video mom and like frankly will

419
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,530
I don't have anything useful to do with
this it's like making stuff so only

420
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:30,280
making this random things for the hell
because

421
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,408
that's why I enjoy wheels yes

422
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:38,630
mom since I don't know about rock rap I
won't open it up is a be here user crap

423
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:45,630
anybody from program systems okay cool

424
00:21:45,999 --> 00:21:52,999
sayin

425
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,980
got so

426
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,300
and to you is it isn't working up to
expectations we see it doing in the next

427
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,550
year to how are things going

428
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:20,100
go

429
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,249
go

430
00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:27,910
yet

431
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,220
so

432
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:38,220
awesome

433
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,580
yet yeah all these except on Centre St
our profiles

434
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,710
on there's an open source for incall or
delusion which is

435
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,440
java-based runs for you on months old
platforms

436
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,280
that really unique its prettiest operate
you can actually do blender 3d to

437
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,790
anybody else wonder spirits

438
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:59,610
you can tweak you can tweak some
parameters and when Italy's use

439
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,420
and you can build the miles and wonder
our evolution book for those are free

440
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,110
3d Studio Max things like that will no
up in STL files

441
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,320
but I read in on some other so these
things the

442
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,240
the it will warn you if you're designs
too complex things like that was

443
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,420
generally try to make it but you do need
to her have certainly

444
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,610
waukee simplified designs can't do
anything to find bring with these

445
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,680
machines because

446
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,460
their precision area are still so they
work usually no meters

447
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,630
you know plus or minus half milliliter
is like a

448
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,100
I think the the fab home the best I've
guns like plus/minus

449
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,660
nowhere I think people got a more
accurate but people have more experience

450
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,260
than on

451
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:48,260
sir

452
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:55,450
so it

453
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:03,490
yeah

454
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:14,000
yet definitely and no you know that's it
said Lisa

455
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,050
it's not a perfect bill G it's still
growing i think thats on

456
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,840
do you see a freak you did you design a
ago just to STL files and

457
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,840
and use that eighteen hours

458
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:33,980
sweet

459
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:40,980
of

460
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:06,830
yeah

461
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:12,510
rate

462
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,680
yeah is that

463
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,190
I've seen you know I've actually talk
guys it's back up the envelope

464
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,370
calculations but I don't think there's
been any real official study on this

465
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,860
on and the general agreement is also
like the stuff really isn't greenery

466
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,910
like there's the potential there's that
like fine skyward get there

467
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,360
and I there's totally chance I'm that's
what I'm voting for

468
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,730
but own it's not there yet all other
materials they're using

469
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,460
are kinda nasty mature read the MSDS
sheets on this it's like

470
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,240
mmm I don't really know the only reason
this into its own internal affairs you

471
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:43,880
know that their

472
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,880
the illegal stuff but it's so that's
something we need to work

473
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:04,309
no was once its its low what's the harm
in not too bad

474
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,509
and like I don't think a little bit I've
material from what a shot glass early

475
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:12,080
using of something I printed things an
effort to talk thing I just

476
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,049
the chocolate because I use of it s
pretty but if the sorting like if you're

477
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,049
making forty million other

478
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:21,099
or if there really is one of these shops
in every corner like what

479
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:28,099
what happens or what is that comes out

480
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:38,809
for

481
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:18,299
cool

482
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:26,130
so

483
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,690
very cool very nestle so

484
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:58,890
basically when you're going to jump back
up in by grade

485
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,430
across so attacks yeah

486
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,840
on so yeah I think I think that
potentially

487
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,130
this is exactly what plea my interest in
it is because I don't think it's a

488
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,710
things a one-shot solution I i think
that right now technology is growing

489
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,880
and I think that the hacker can you
should get instance

490
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,160
Syria because you know lyn is an awesome
tool it's out there anybody can grab it

491
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,160
it is given a lot of power wanted
individuals it is Paul

492
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,520
you it is level the playing field like
you can learn stuff you can get access

493
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,490
to knowledge you can access to tools

494
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,650
using one exit cake otherwise you know

495
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,360
are to pollution wonder things like that
they're like their tools on top of tools

496
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:37,990
you know I

497
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,890
I think a lot of these other 3d programs
on the path unless a brief look at

498
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,020
what's it like a dude you can actually
pull this off

499
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,870
and for me like that is what I see my
interest and I hope to

500
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,320
get that interests Park in other people
feel it art technologies here

501
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,840
and we got out early you know we got a
lead in the direction that is that is

502
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,910
cool for us that gives us the ability to
make what we want to figure out what we

503
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,050
want to play wiffle

504
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,530
rather than like letting it just
naturally lean towards you some personal

505
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,370
system where

506
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:06,450
yet to ship it off to you Iowa get
repaired play with something

507
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,030
split home

508
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,230
so yeah I don't have much more slides I
really wasn't expecting you know

509
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,170
have lower for talk so I didn't plan to
offer toss home

510
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:21,670
I was wondering you know the one hand
talk about this does anybody

511
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:28,670
else have comments or ideas on this
whoever might do to cheer about your

512
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:35,899
yeah

513
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,899
all we do not have a legal structure

514
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:42,149
a we are on relative under a local
nonprofit armor trying to figure out

515
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:45,289
frankly if you want to do it LLC and or

516
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:48,740
wanna go for the for the nonprofit
status you like 501 c3

517
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,659
nobody can really make any money off
this like I don't think this potential

518
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:53,620
is just a lot of fun

519
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:57,429
but there is you know units really are
whether you wanna officially

520
00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:01,970
do that and say like okay officially in
the wall how we operate it's not profit

521
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,470
or

522
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,799
just do it I'll see it expects never
make any arm

523
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:09,200
the cool see me me for medical things to
tell you the truth

524
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,409
home we only had three for about two
weeks now on this we've been doing a lot

525
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:14,320
of test prints

526
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,020
um you know we've made you know lots of
letters

527
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,629
craft markets actually recorded King of
Prussia like half an hour away

528
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:26,230
so I have a box of craft mark demo
materials on my desk at home

529
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,450
that I was can play with them here this
weekend on but it's it's really nice

530
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:31,690
that it's small enough that like

531
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,190
I you know the Fashion Week eight do
during your by the only a one of their

532
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,370
stuff year's budget stuff

533
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:42,419
they come so next year I'll have a much
better answer the question there's

534
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:43,980
another guy back there

535
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,079
up

536
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,899
he said he's

537
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:58,899
me

538
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:06,570
K

539
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:11,149
your own right now there's there sir two
things in one is

540
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:15,489
the the software and and how
sophisticated takes to use it

541
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:18,799
i think is very rare you know is the is
the most obvious barrier

542
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,499
and the others a material science
question arm there are a bunch materials

543
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:25,139
people are using and there's a lot of

544
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:28,269
there's a lot of expansion other
materials you know the fat a home wiki

545
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:29,529
has pages of like

546
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,879
here's an idea what to make here I tried
it it kind of worked

547
00:31:32,879 --> 00:31:36,690
here's an idea what to make sure I tried
it really works well on people right now

548
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,940
are out there basically like

549
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,409
pushing out in all directions on the
materials

550
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:44,769
training get fast use materials that are
can break down

551
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,299
but that is where the barriers like
loading machines up getting a serial

552
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:48,899
setup

553
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:53,519
on is the love frustration right now on
any other actually something that people

554
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,969
on the circuit up with a lot which is
software for

555
00:31:55,969 --> 00:32:00,589
arm a lot of tools for this were
existing tools for 3d

556
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:04,418
you know for 3d stuff like wonder or are
delusional on

557
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:07,619
or their their homebrew software was
written in the last year

558
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,089
that is you know allowed got some money
they got a grad student for an undergrad

559
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:12,259
student and the

560
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:15,459
they set the software on so there's

561
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:17,940
you know it's all right there it's
alright on service you have to think

562
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,009
very far to find

563
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:22,699
interesting things to work on and in the
fabrication stuff home

564
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:26,299
you know I'm a complete a lots of
orgasms of archive it

565
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:29,739
you know the user interface for fat home
is just

566
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:34,099
is really a kinda p use right now and
there's three or four people working on

567
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,059
trying to clean it up

568
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:38,158
you know you load a file you were
another file and then you're not sure

569
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:38,839
which

570
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:43,049
closer which many was was you know
there's times right hit Prince

571
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:45,729
and it just the print button is greyed
out there's no explanation there's the

572
00:32:45,729 --> 00:32:47,919
status bar at the bottom doesn't say
anything it's just

573
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,289
that but just doesn't work anymore so I
close the program down I start back up

574
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:51,979
to rate you know

575
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:55,659
threw open the buckminster step through
C works you're not working

576
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:59,649
on so there's you know if people wanted
again this is a really cool thing to

577
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:00,479
work on and wake

578
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:04,599
your result isn't just something that
you can throw on SourceForge a fresh me

579
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:07,599
like a result is the thing you could put
on your desk and you know it's

580
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:14,599
nothing

581
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,520
yes it's not really concerned the
concern is usually like your material

582
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,430
supplier we have

583
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,480
like little late an ounce cans material
that

584
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,530
its prolly 50 bucks material or
something like that so making

585
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,760
you know and it takes eight hours to
make a pretty six hours to make a pit

586
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:41,180
of something that's moderately complex
so

587
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,700
like the bigger issue isn't is the
machine where are the bigger issues like

588
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,560
how or am I getting right now because
you know you start print

589
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,240
and I'll go to ground the hackerspace
things up things and drawers make little

590
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:52,900
labels

591
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,090
cider together pro towards a comeback
and it's so pretty point man on a single

592
00:33:57,090 --> 00:33:57,500
day

593
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,130
so I go off nearly even a comeback it
froze on your half an hour ago

594
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,670
you I have to restart so your home these
machines are last a long time

595
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:09,290
just built on standard stepper motors
and a lot of them have

596
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,350
serena's units that are replaceable you
pull out if they clogged up you can you

597
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:16,900
clean and you can thurmond get a new one
sir just small

598
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,130
and then the chasuna you know that those
things last for a long time

599
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,040
but you know the bigger things like
basically tweets

600
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:31,040
and again doing moving on moving things
like that

601
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,600
yeah

602
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,799
you can buy so the big the big

603
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,630
barrier on that is what size you want
you can buy from Sears all three

604
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,560
thousand dollar unit

605
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,830
that can do you about me 10 inches by 12
inches

606
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,909
and it's great you know he's got issues
acecomm ordered it comes in it actually

607
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:55,830
from whatever as deputies and software

608
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,279
on if you want like a table size you
really get to about

609
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,890
five thousand dollars arm and that's
going to be the cutting system with al

610
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,779
without a background table without the
the bench based less things like that

611
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,090
you want all that is going up to about
7,000 I was looking

612
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,400
just the other day getting a was at 48
by

613
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,520
30 on cutting surface ago %uh 5,000
houses cheap

614
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,960
but thats just the machining on the top
on you really have to have a very stable

615
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,770
base to run these on because

616
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:28,230
the way the motors likes lou back and
forth the tender

617
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,310
for checking the park you know you can
throw together with table what its

618
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:31,890
prolly gonna

619
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,730
falls apart from from movement in a few
months your the

620
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,580
very you much less exacts caught up on
so again

621
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,860
like some those dollars you isn't much
but

622
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:46,940
is it really something that you want in
your own garage or you want but you will

623
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,540
have your

624
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,740
corruption or is it better to put
together you know get some space

625
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,260
somewhere

626
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:59,260
serve you can get to an Li you for your
money clear effort in said for us

627
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:26,930
all

628
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,790
I would I would love to get I've make
sure you write that down efforts catch

629
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,660
up with its owner

630
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,868
on a graph that on there's two products
they're leaning in that direction

631
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:54,300
arm its are two things that makes me
think of one is

632
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,570
on in what is it nor the

633
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,170
Terry Pratchett books that authorities
might only need to for dorf

634
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:05,230
to be successful as a fire to the fire
can make for 240 can make tools and tool

635
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:08,770
make better tools and Gimli two years
and flair and/or can make any

636
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,090
and thats very much the same idea just
wrapping up on there's a program that

637
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,700
uses

638
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,440
based on doing a horrible car parts and
its it centered on getting that

639
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,780
technology in Africa

640
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,430
where they have scraps of the comes down
to just one apart by hand

641
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:26,779
and same ID serve the drum brake he
serves just setting fire under drum

642
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,530
brake and useless of terminal from the
cars new

643
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,710
you working for some tools and then from
there you can build more

644
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,960
so like the that idea is you know it's
an awesome idea it's not that it's a

645
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:37,600
fuller

646
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,569
yeah on anybody else

647
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:50,570
I thought so in them

648
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:59,930
year wall okay so the factory in January

649
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:04,368
just got our space story the nonprofit
the world brothers and we have a third

650
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:06,660
floor it's completely trashed when she
got there

651
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:11,399
and we have I had fifty dollars that's
all we had and our decision at that time

652
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,970
as me to settle the backing former first
we gotta backing former and jigsaw

653
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:18,339
so we could you make plastic forms and
then cut them out

654
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:21,420
and send them on from there and then

655
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:25,589
they regard as tools are going to be a
small saw and we just got a chop saw

656
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:28,930
so you know yeah I think it takes I was
a nice

657
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:32,410
first step tool on a lot of places have
chosen

658
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,740
a lot of guys are doing their own homes
shops just go for the with a

659
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:39,630
non-motorized CNC machine and then the
bill Millers on that

660
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,930
and like that is they're learning how to
use the technology the building at

661
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,379
themselves and they do it on the cheap

662
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,910
because on much of sorry I would say

663
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:56,910
scores of would be one of the few good
options to go yeah he wields

664
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,329
yet was I spoke with a timely looking it
the different options for that

665
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:10,150
arm and frankly what when I came down to
was I don't

666
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,430
we'll have the time to do that there's a
lot of good projects

667
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,538
and there are several web sites out
there that are centered on the do

668
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:18,589
yourselves in Seaside on

669
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:22,369
and its totally doable you can just go
out and get the machine you can buy the

670
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:23,470
engine parts there's

671
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,119
software their sons examples there's
guys that do everything from like do

672
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,690
designing their own boards sure you can
buy like people mortar board sets

673
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,529
the run of something like an Arduino or
just offer all parallel port

674
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:37,680
so you can you know like the making for
souls

675
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,038
up with other with just use the make
motor control on

676
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:44,210
so yet there definitely is a good
potential for doing that

677
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,539
on pretty sure for but it's a big
investment a time when things that

678
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:50,980
I again coming from software background
arm like

679
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:54,130
I was serve over on that the time it
takes to to make some stuff like

680
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:57,029
with software if I know what I'm
building again to sit down I can do it

681
00:39:57,029 --> 00:39:57,509
with

682
00:39:57,509 --> 00:40:00,589
mechanical stuff I severely
underestimated the difference between

683
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:01,109
like

684
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:04,240
knowing how to do something and actually
having it done

685
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,500
you know there's there's a to me at
least is a bigger barrier

686
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,230
you know if I know suffragist it go it
comes out if I know mechanical thing

687
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:14,880
I do it it's wrong at all the second one
a measure for times like it there's

688
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,880
there's a big time commitment on getting
into buildings yourself

689
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:35,450
the PCB makers in the air

690
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,470
yes

691
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,610
yeah I think there's I think they're
sort a column will use things like a

692
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:48,190
stepping

693
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,290
this latest epic somewhere if you build
one it'll make it easier to build the

694
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:51,940
others

695
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,700
arm but you know I don't see them
converging like in one machine

696
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,240
and I don't see them totally solve the
problem making the others

697
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,650
that's you know one thing to talk about
his way into backing former we looked at

698
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,010
the road the fat home

699
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:07,270
and there's a plastic shell and really
go we could we could like backing from

700
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,630
the shell or something like that like

701
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:13,230
what tools can use to make other tools
arm they're definitely you know they

702
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:13,690
definitely

703
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:16,800
you can't bootstrap probably if you did
it the right way people want to or

704
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,240
all the parts from that built the other
but I think that will take

705
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:27,240
actually a lot effort to of and

706
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,410
said

707
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:37,410
yeah programs very cool like that

708
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,000
this

709
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,640
I'm

710
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,879
this service home sat at home is done

711
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,650
they haven't done PCB that they've done
batteries and they've done

712
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,049
army mechanical obviously that die
electric medals

713
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:54,680
that will then when you apply voltage
for them and there was

714
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,940
there's a couple presents with a late on
a plastic case the new lay down their

715
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,440
various

716
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,329
monolayers and then case the top in
plastic and then you know you play

717
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:03,970
literacy to abandon turn

718
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,519
doesn't directly apply to the project
itself so

719
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:11,869
all the things I've that I found kind of
hard as I'm getting into this

720
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:15,289
like I said I'm not super qualified to
be talking or anything I'm just just our

721
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:16,289
clients up myself

722
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:19,510
is a lot of stuff is out there done but
it's not common

723
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,089
internet yet again like I was like I
love it %uh there's gonna be a wiki

724
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:23,920
somewhere there's not

725
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,559
of fines you know fines and I you know
it's like I did the seven things unlike

726
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,569
why does no one know about this cuz that
would be so useful if I found out also I

727
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:34,569
spent a lot of time in correspondence

728
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,009
digging out information about you things
that are out there but are

729
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:42,160
really publicized gender or just you
know right at the end above

730
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,140
quick web search I

731
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:53,140
home well your questions home

732
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:05,480
and

733
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,060
phone

734
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,600
sleeves were going on it doesn't know
the as enter private Dogan and former

735
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,040
much

736
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,050
will see them looking at the lemme the
PC side suffer for it

737
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,300
are more things we haven't talked about
as doing a central dispatcher

738
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,760
on there's Rep Raptors that a homer
several these machines

739
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,130
all into the same goal but they're
already separate silos us of course they

740
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:29,470
are you guys when we make a deal

741
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:32,580
you taking its offer design make a
central dispatcher

742
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,630
you tools your tools all know how to
talk to it your

743
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,020
interpreters up the STL files into tool
paths on the hundred Saint will pass

744
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:40,520
down

745
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,910
on me like that but what our goals again
the stuff is like super fresh like

746
00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:48,350
I was on the bus again reading emails
people being like hey guys why does

747
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:50,640
reprobate Feb home get together its
software

748
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,680
you know and it was yesterday event
exceed they've reply via

749
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,149
so on this stuff is like rate it's right
at the surface like
