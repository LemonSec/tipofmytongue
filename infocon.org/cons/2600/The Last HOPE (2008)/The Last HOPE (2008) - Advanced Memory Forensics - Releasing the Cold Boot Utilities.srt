1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,569
alright just a couple a quick
announcements before we get to our next

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:06,569
discussion

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,450
if you haven't been downstairs on the
second floor there's a lot of cool stuff

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,200
going on people's soldering

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,230
taking stuff apart put it back together
again

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:17,949
7i some kind of %uh dildos culture of
some kind

7
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:21,310
if you've come across that I am also

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,240
a manual asked me to give a couple uva
quick notes if you could try to pick up

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,460
after yourself like soda bottles and
stuff like that just because we are

10
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,340
cramming in

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,230
om and a lot of people going in and out
so please use the trash receptacles also

12
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,510
if you see several people walking around
with what looks like Old English that's

13
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,180
not

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,670
liquor that's actually what is called
the jolt

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,309
Germany its club Monte and Emmanuel
brought in

16
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:49,410
several palates that arrived on a
container ship

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,469
I'm from Germany yesterday

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,920
and it's this stuff and its awesome so

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,699
it's for sale it's we're not sign it
right here is for sale downstairs in the

20
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,309
second floor they might have some appear
as well but definitely try exits amazing

21
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,460
I and you might need it to stay up I'll

22
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,850
for the late night stuff I also DVD
sales have all the discussions are in

23
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,689
the vendor area on the eighteenth floor
they're burning them on the fly

24
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:18,040
from what I understand so if you mister
discussion you can always pick up a copy

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,220
I and also again please be nice to the
hotel

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,060
and out the other TVs alone in there's
there's a whole city to cause trouble in

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,150
out their stuff

28
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,600
make you sick please go out

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,600
meet our good friends the NYPD I'm but I
let's get on to our next discussion

30
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,110
I Jacob Appelbaum is a member of the
Noisebridge HAC lab in San Francisco

31
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,659
he's also a professional photographer
you can see some is amazing photographs

32
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:47,430
on his website

33
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,520
and our is published a lot of magazines
and he's been on point

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,000
going about it the joint times on these
also developer on the Tor project

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,030
this discussion is i'd vanced memory
forensics

36
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:05,030
releasing the cold utilities was given a
project about a bomb

37
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,769
well I'm going to a readjust my
resolution here so

38
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,910
carry on for a moment thanks to

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,660
puzzler totally awesome guy also a
really great photographer and

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,040
couple michaele others are sitting over
there in the corner as well

41
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,040
fix this

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:58,290
wouldn't you now

43
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,530
great

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,860
area

45
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,980
okay so adviser saying I'm

46
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,269
a member the Tor project also
Knightsbridge this project is only

47
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,240
tangentially related to the Tor project

48
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,040
I'm interested just generally and
security and forensics specifically have

49
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,519
an interest in anti friends ex

50
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,560
and northridge is where a lot of the
work of for the west coast

51
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,970
part of our team took place will call on
Sat shown from the FF working on this

52
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:33,280
diligently most the time an ice bridge
meetings but also other time said the

53
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,380
about us so we had a ridiculous number
of cooper's on our paper

54
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:42,200
this is the list cooper's time

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,400
have the team was princeton they're
pretty much the best computer scientists

56
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,989
I've ever had the privilege of working
with

57
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,010
their incredibly smart very humble
quick-thinking just wonderful people

58
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,310
and they're also really really good
actors so

59
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,680
basically and the summer of 2007

60
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,370
I was hopped up on a lot of this Monte
in Germany at the case communications

61
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,360
camp and

62
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,140
such shown in I realize that it was
possible after seeing a small talk and

63
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,150
memory forensics

64
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,149
to sort of create a memory stamp which
is this idea of creating an

65
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,010
recognizable pattern memory and then
taking that

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,669
and searching for it after you powered
machine of

67
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,849
we had an IBM laptop and that IBM laptop

68
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,060
had memory retention times up to 25
seconds without cooling

69
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,080
we realize just by being able to inspect

70
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,159
Devin them on a Linux machine that this
was possible we realize that

71
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,169
doesn't of course in order to use that
device required a whole bunch of memory

72
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,349
to be used in a stomped on a lot of
important bits

73
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,390
we realize that the memory attention
itself was quite interesting

74
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,539
there was a bunch of previous work
specifically by

75
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:56,099
scoreboard it off and of course Peter
Goodman on

76
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,820
nothing specifically about deer am
resistance are

77
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,030
persistence so basically we realize that
we could write some practical

78
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,570
extraction tools and those tools would
be useful for all sorts of

79
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,479
research and basically the first thing
that came to mind was that there are

80
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,000
major security concerns with

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,550
any sort of thing that relies on access
control so the computer

82
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,110
and of course if you're using some
cryptography and you even if you want to

83
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,250
securely use keys if you can control
when the machine is powered off and you

84
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,789
know that the memory will be retained
for some amount of time

85
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:32,640
that'll be possible to extract the keys
even if the developer has gone to great

86
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,550
lengths

87
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,289
to to stop you from having the keys I'm

88
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:40,700
this is a sort of hi

89
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,940
high-level overview this our paper goes
into a lot of details talks about the

90
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,270
retention times for different

91
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,719
different ships the retention time can
wildly very

92
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,310
it can be something like have a second
can be thirty-seconds

93
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,349
it can the when called it's pretty much

94
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:00,120
uniformly no decay if you do use of
reviewed on a machine it's also

95
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,729
pretty much uniformly no decay so sum up
the

96
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,180
things that we did in the paper were
very useful when you have the K and some

97
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,550
of them were useful if you didn't have
any decay

98
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,570
basically both of them both of those
things

99
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,250
are something you might encounter
depending on how you want it to you

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,210
perform this research

101
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,120
so there's also some videos that
demonstrate and I won't play them

102
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,990
because you can to stem download them
online and their couple of caveats

103
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,430
numbers people here mention that they
were unable to reproduce

104
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,050
certain parts of this research and
several those people later told me that

105
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,289
they had ECC memory

106
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:37,669
ECC memory generally scrubs the bits

107
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:40,890
in the memory when it boots

108
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,760
the controller basically Intel specs for
certain memory controllers

109
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,240
specifically stipulates that in order to
make sure that the ECC memory will be

110
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,390
utilized properly so that you can have
error correction

111
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:56,169
you do scrub all the best so naturally
if you just rebooted machine it has ECC

112
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:56,729
memory

113
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,280
and you're using American related
implemented Intel suggests

114
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,840
you will not see memory retention but it
isn't because the memory isn't

115
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,510
actually there I'll when you've done the
review it's that it's been specifically

116
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,640
scrub which can be useful if you have a
machine

117
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,490
describes memory and you can force a
reboot upon detecting an event

118
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,310
but is not actually you aren't subject
to these

119
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,020
this issues that I'm going to talk about
so basically

120
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,469
these are the different file systems
that we analyzed we had

121
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,470
that locker files all encryptor cripple
up as:

122
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:34,220
so day able to hear you say it is cool

123
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,100
alright exhibit Locker was
simultaneously

124
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,630
the weakest and strongest its kinda
interesting

125
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,870
they basically have a mode where you
Turner

126
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:50,110
took a bit longer basic you turn the
machine on it get your login screen

127
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,530
what that point the driver started to
crypt in the 80 S key is in memory

128
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,639
and it relies on you not basically being
a log in

129
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,630
and that is not very good it turns out

130
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,020
because it there's no prompting there's
no preview password so the key once it's

131
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,650
in memory

132
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,669
it's it's done UN on

133
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,049
30 p.m. also at certain select times
even though the key is in the TPM

134
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,990
that doesn't necessarily mean that he
stays in the TPM forever in fact

135
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:20,110
during its normal usage just covered out
of 30 p.m.

136
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:23,440
so you're sort of tamper-resistant
possibly chip

137
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,680
maybe you could resist someone attacked
me that way but the way that issues that

138
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,660
automatically

139
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,130
attacks itself from this particular
perspective it's not necessary to

140
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,390
protect 30 p.m. at all

141
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,049
however there are motive in locker can
be put into where marzipan

142
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:41,010
and requires that you basically reenter
all the time

143
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,970
it's not very practical for a server
because server generally doesn't have

144
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,100
operator sitting at although it is when
this mission so

145
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,410
we don't know I'm as far as

146
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,540
50 goes it was actually the

147
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,870
most hilarious all the ones we analyzed

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,260
because file has a bug in log in when
you tap

149
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,209
basically the way that this works is
that you login and it keeps your login

150
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:04,980
credentials

151
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,089
in memory for the entire time you log in
you know when you lock the screen

152
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,310
which is terrible

153
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:15,350
at least I thought it was pretty bad
when I reported the bike I got about 60

154
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:19,150
miles from people saying oh I reported
about like six years ago still there

155
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:22,260
it turns out the reason it's there
according to one of my contacts that

156
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,270
Apple security is because

157
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,290
the use that so they do privilege
escalation in some way that requires

158
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,390
them to take your password

159
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,520
memory and they don't wanna prompt the
user and even though they have

160
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,270
framework for prompting the user and
getting ass password from these are

161
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,319
there times when for whatever reason

162
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:41,520
they don't want to prompt the user and
they don't want to you

163
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,890
but another elevating religious kinda
strange

164
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,890
so they haven't fixed it yet so if you
see an accident here in sleep mode

165
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,959
it has its own a password in the memory
you can attack

166
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,480
firewire you all searches very bad bike
and it's pretty old

167
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,030
sadly GM clinics also has this problem

168
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,510
which I was kinda surprised I didn't
find that someone else told me about it

169
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,990
I think was sherry David of was with
into guardians

170
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,980
mention this so that that was great
though because

171
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:13,490
File Vault basically you need to have

172
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,560
the show 1h Mac and that basically
initialization vector

173
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,850
and Vicki see need to find several
things in memory but if you have a login

174
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,530
and password you can use you tell you
that well fine man and I rode

175
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,540
for the congress a couple years ago
basically just

176
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,900
decrepit without having to you cancer
kitties there too

177
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,410
possible ways Attack File Vault its

178
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,150
and its kid stuff my father's the
easiest to break in that regard

179
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,420
jim Kerr was straightforward Alex
Halderman actually just wrote a small

180
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,959
patch for

181
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,150
basically taking iraqi trigger

182
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,480
was I think basically consistent with
where it's stored

183
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,350
things that are necessary so if you knew
a little bit about the memory layout

184
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,900
you could find things are necessary to
curb it and if they ask

185
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,880
we didn't actually do the initial
analysis including Bay yes because it

186
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,380
was

187
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,120
a little bit more complex but it was I
just for confusing

188
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,180
I like this store be they want to flip
bets

189
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,579
so that you don't leave memory
persisting because they don't want you

190
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:15,760
to I guess oxidized the RAM cells

191
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,980
i think is peter gammons basic

192
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,140
attack from like 1992 so sick footing
bit so you know

193
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,160
leave behind like cheat it's imprinted
in the chip itself they can be found

194
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,829
I guarantee if this is that means a key
twice as much King information

195
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:33,170
is necessary to reduce Ricky so you have
like

196
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,189
yeah see fits so thats

197
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:39,870
that's good if you an attack that which
is too bad I really like to bathe yes

198
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,240
but it turns out that

199
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,189
dislike crisis yes an hour

200
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:49,709
so we have five tools that are releasing
today

201
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:53,640
primarily they were written by Bill Paul
if you've ever used FreeBSD

202
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,630
hero your internet driver all of them

203
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,920
he also wrote project evil which was the
end this rapper basically emulating

204
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,309
Windows so that you could news you know
proprietary minor blobs for getting

205
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,620
on WiFi network specific guys like

206
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,699
amazing I works at win River works on
the ex-works just

207
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,650
badass engineer he I actually heard such
and I talk about how we were having some

208
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,699
trouble writing

209
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:22,530
on every down for an x86 assembler at a
party and

210
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,280
sec well United hack something up say
when home from the party and he wrote it

211
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,520
and

212
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,449
I don't know forty-eight hours

213
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:34,760
is amazing guys just amazing

214
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,059
best engineer I've ever met we also have

215
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:41,209
primarily written by Nadia and Alex over
there the AEX

216
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:44,410
yes fix yes key finding the RC key
finder

217
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,610
on intellectual contributions here
definitely as: fix

218
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,040
an ASP fine and the BIOS managing if I'm
mm in char

219
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,569
something that you can write these ones
for just specifically

220
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:59,870
useful for what we want to do not get
into each one second and your city find

221
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,959
a lot of people talked about doing this
other people implemented in I've never

222
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,579
seen a public implementation so here's a
public

223
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:10,319
limitation I think not erode in just a
couple hours

224
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:14,199
just like the crib diversion bill

225
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:17,370
so out there's one said

226
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,160
under these tools which a lot of people
have also asked me about size 12 mention

227
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,030
esta bit onlookers who was not going to
be released

228
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:28,520
there is a filesystem component to the
locker where you can

229
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,569
in a robbery with BitLocker Drive
anything pic support

230
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:36,110
few system that may someday come out

231
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,199
we're unable to reach the cali wrote
that portion in time

232
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,470
for this talk but it's possible we never
planned to release the fully automated

233
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,589
exploit

234
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,780
a lot of people ask for me are going to
do that

235
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,660
were interested in research attacks the
line

236
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,769
I'm so

237
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,850
so as I stress this not attack tools

238
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,420
these tools are the minimum required to
carry out a research

239
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,480
their limited and what they do
specifically they do everything so

240
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,199
but it but there are limited in that we
don't have them on omitted

241
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:14,269
there now weaponize require some user
interaction it's trivial to change this

242
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,509
but if you doing this in a lab setting
it isn't necessary to you

243
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:20,769
to do anything more than what we have

244
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:24,759
there there's some room where you could
add some timers automatically shut the

245
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,750
machines down

246
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,819
and then with the back up with a week
online packet that's something that we

247
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:29,269
did

248
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,490
if you care about that kinda time
instead

249
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:36,279
definitely contact us help you set up a
laboratory to verify results

250
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,230
I'm some of them will actually work in
GW

251
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:43,660
so if you are on Windows and you want to
build them you can

252
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,730
probably due to should work just fine so
they're saying something I wrote this

253
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:52,540
this god-awful assembler dumper
basically it was a special

254
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,029
blocking food and it was like a ed

255
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,439
for memory I it was

256
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:03,240
horrible evers so bad we working -qn you
a lot to get it

257
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,209
to get it going and eventually got it
working in we got the for $640 K

258
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:10,930
memory without stomping on it and we
were pretty sure that we had this

259
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,399
with your way is total crap on what bill
road in about an hour was so much better

260
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,750
that it wasn't even worth

261
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,110
looking at some way again ready NC was a
much better idea

262
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,389
we're thinking to art about the problem
when

263
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:28,600
right direction so that brings us to the
actual tool

264
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,769
bias manage which is a cool package

265
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:35,430
it's really useful is specifically

266
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,199
supporting both 32 and 64 bit machines
and it's been tested on both

267
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,399
so you should definitely be able to use
this and have no trouble

268
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,060
and it's written in C it's very very
small so the pics

269
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:50,970
numbers really great you build you build
a pic saddam utility

270
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:56,110
once it's on basically to secure server
and it's just little payload

271
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,170
and you can basically if you want to you
we have our pillow down to three

272
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,730
kilobytes and size and that's total so
you break the machine

273
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,300
and once you put it the machine it gets
a DHCP lease

274
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,430
it loads this program into memory and
it's

275
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,439
32 lights so you don't stomp on what up
its and depending on the operating

276
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,120
system that you're specifically

277
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,139
analyzing doing your research you will
see that I you are nowhere near the bits

278
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,939
that are important operating system but

279
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,829
some people to try to get crafty maybe
put like there's turkeys and video

280
00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:33,399
card memory space yes i'd like that it
doesn't matter

281
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:36,750
this utility will probably find X except
on the road specifically against

282
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,630
in a little bit will will show you that

283
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,860
so basically

284
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,139
disagree is the best are the utilities I
think because it's the most tested and

285
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,630
it's so useful for automation

286
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,399
being able to shed a machine gun away
happens and if the spill it again is

287
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:53,970
really good for

288
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,279
timing measurements so you could
probably make it smaller

289
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,819
by simply removing every experience
Pranab

290
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,970
call all sorts but so it's probably

291
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,130
eagerly and optimize December Everton's

292
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,059
is necessary GCC attend bill

293
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,559
wanted also to have a dispute over we
originally wrote one that was

294
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,199
sis Linux program and basically the
company to program

295
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,620
but it's a slight accent stomped on it
on a bit till the stuff that made it

296
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,709
possible that program very easily to
dump the memory

297
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:31,390
and it was nice because it meant all we
had to do was turned machine analysis

298
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:31,809
Lenexa

299
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:36,178
run this really small c:\program word on
bill was unhappy with this and

300
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,090
we're being lazy so cover basically

301
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:44,320
being bill she had a ipod

302
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,990
old minnie's and I that was the only USB
disk that he had so

303
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,399
she figured out how to read partition
and so that he could

304
00:17:51,399 --> 00:17:54,659
simultaneously and memory downs well

305
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:58,740
also being a listener Peters because

306
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,690
I don't like no joke this was a nice
Pacific weaponization this was the only

307
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,640
USB disk

308
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,039
had and he also only had one mp3 player

309
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,080
so what he did

310
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,928
was pretty genius he basically has a
small partition for memory dumps and a

311
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,450
small partition for mp3's

312
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,610
and the bootloader block is an important
to the iPod and the firmware stored

313
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:20,270
somewhere else

314
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:25,460
so it's pretty simple no package
actually explains exactly how to set up

315
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,179
an iPod

316
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,110
yes so in theory you could combine this
with other iPod based

317
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,020
tilly's if you want to but it's great

318
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,540
because it was just like I couldn't
bring USB disk over

319
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:43,720
fast enough so this before I got on the
bus it's it's ridiculous that's true

320
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,399
on this utility is limited because we
didn't feel like putting on more time

321
00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:47,880
into it

322
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,070
basically captures a single dont yes

323
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,389
so the first thing we thought about
improving was probably to change this

324
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:56,770
memory dump program

325
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:59,889
so that it would down you know it said
an idea

326
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,649
have a couple of things from the system
collecting some meta data like the clock

327
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:07,370
things like that everyone to you it
wasn't really a necessity

328
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,490
so didn't bother but if you were going
to expand this to do timing on

329
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,190
video memory decay in addition or you
want to see how it behaves

330
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:20,350
you dude this tool it's pretty simple

331
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,710
and of course to them but

332
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,799
to you so bill also

333
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:31,389
just ridiculously so wrote this

334
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:36,320
reported the obvious TTC his tactic if I

335
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,820
also lecturer time as crazy

336
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,490
I'm this is only 32bit because Apple has
a lot of

337
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,590
really undocumented interfaces

338
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,780
and basically even though the use if I
it's like Apple specially if I

339
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,790
so this works on McInnis 32bits

340
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,918
and it also works our books that are

341
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,270
I guess are books that are the two bits
as well

342
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,899
sort of had some problems we tried
64-bit machine

343
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,760
we weren't sure there was a 64-bit
machine kinda crazy

344
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,889
crashed in person machine owning spare
happy with that

345
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,639
but we eventually fix their machine it
figured out that at the firmware

346
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,649
password enabled

347
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,210
was a little bit difficult to get around
that would technique tried

348
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:24,500
just hurry but eventually we were able
to get

349
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,580
were able to get some 64-bit code
trapped

350
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,320
and it did work but we didn't put any
time into it so the only thing it

351
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,620
actually working as the 32-bit stuff

352
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,790
I think some of the beginnings of a
64-bit stuff are also in here so

353
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,960
wouldn't be too much time but

354
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,700
it's probably not worth anyone's time to
do this

355
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,500
although combined with the fact that
Apple server fuses to you

356
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,409
to fix that bug any reasonable amount of
time

357
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:57,190
five years might be worth me and 64-bit

358
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,909
measured decay all the different accent
present tabletop Monte

359
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:04,389
just K is a real problem

360
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,340
doesn't work well for me and my
particular security culture whatever

361
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,178
company here

362
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:11,790
whatever your with although I don't
think anything will change their mind

363
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,970
how that works it's probably not worth

364
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,500
also toolchain getting the torch and set
up for building if I stuff is

365
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,280
it's interesting and not in a fun way

366
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,658
and so the three tools that are useful
have a good an actor

367
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,080
about one of them sec I'm Wednesday

368
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,990
aspects which is something that Nadia
finish writing

369
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,690
couple days ago and improved like 100
percent in speed improvements or

370
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,399
something like that

371
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:44,490
Alexander percent in a couple hours
before getting on the train

372
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,030
come over here Prince it's basically an
implementation

373
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,200
the air curtain code that we talked
about in our paper its

374
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,330
very simple uni-directional bit
correction

375
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,879
so it can you never actually track up to
fifteen percent affairs

376
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,850
to give you an idea about the kind where
is that we saw in doing news

377
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,799
now sis was basically 0

378
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,360
.1 percent there and if we called it was
pretty much zero

379
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,750
so after an hour and liquid nitrogen its

380
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,899
its not even necessary if you had a que
still be very useful

381
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:25,250
when you combine it with yes key finder
basically fines 128 bit and 256-bit

382
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,570
she's and the keys that it's better

383
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,928
you know tells you the outset everything
as a progress bar

384
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,860
screen and if Isaac is in memory trucks
if

385
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:41,879
if it is necessary yes six-minute and
there's a key finders again

386
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:45,330
its limited and how it has been tested
as it with a passion

387
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,710
X basically and it successfully finds
our cities

388
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:53,230
so that might be abuse

389
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,480
nature for what

390
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,480
if you want to download all this this is
the URL

391
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:10,830
it's blue on blue for a reason and the
reason is that I was

392
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:15,159
having a little trouble with my
PowerPoint

393
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,690
alright its aircraft knock-off our point
but it's basically the same URL

394
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,240
as as as PDF its

395
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,500
said p princeton use less memory slash

396
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,620
code just before called

397
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,240
attacks for single and slash code find
it and PGP

398
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:38,640
signatures are actually Nana right now
so you wanna wait if you're using this

399
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,190
network

400
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,790
so one other tools that was

401
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,290
certif instrumental and attacking

402
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:52,570
five hours file fall which ralph one
minute I wrote some number of years ago

403
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,629
Germany and basically

404
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,190
its open source implementation file

405
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:02,630
for decrypting so you can take an image

406
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,510
have the password as the password the
program entitled to curb it and

407
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,860
at the same time you can also if you
don't have the password

408
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,950
casa FPGA and bird forces about 2,000
he's a second

409
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,900
hour and software about 300 is a sec and
FPGA is right about a thousand dollars

410
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,430
so from Peter getting so come useful
tool

411
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:27,800
I was actually contacted by the
Department of Homeland Security recently

412
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,360
which is really funny so many levels I

413
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,170
I have no idea why did I it was a good
idea to talk to me

414
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:39,770
but basically they we're trying to get
powerful to work

415
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,860
with file fault and they were having a
bunch of trouble

416
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,480
like they just could not for the life
insults cracked this disparage

417
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,720
I was really interesting too because in
the email the thing that they told me

418
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,210
was that they were trying to you

419
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,760
break the file folder image so that they
could find some evidence to hold some

420
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,170
guy

421
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:03,020
so I said well you know I'm not really
sure that I feel comfortable with

422
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,980
you know an intern for the Department of
Homeland Security contacting me to break

423
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,250
into someone's computer in a

424
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:11,370
are actually accused of crime and they
said well you know if you don't believe

425
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,760
they were at the DHS we're happy to send
you photograph

426
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,760
ice and headquarters and I said well you
know only with issue on your head

427
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,550
and and I'm

428
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,270
it went back and forth a little while
they said well you know if you're not

429
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,520
willing to

430
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,770
give us the key finder code you will
have an agent contact you about the key

431
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:34,300
finder

432
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,410
I suggest you to feel free I don't know
if you're actually from the DHS to their

433
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,530
sending it from there

434
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,480
that your address and I thought it was
just some some clever social engineer is

435
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,240
that was actually not cover all

436
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,800
and then I got an email from an actual
agent the DHS

437
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,430
actually authorize them and looking at
the mail headers you can see all the

438
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,260
mail systems that are used inside and
out of the DHS and

439
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,320
sure enough he authorized me to give
them all of the things that they'd ask

440
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,780
for

441
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,399
whatever it was and I hope that was
kinda interesting so I ignore their

442
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,890
email for a while on their own me a
couple more times

443
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:09,680
and there are going to tell me that the
key finder code

444
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,020
they reimplemented from our paper and
that it didn't work

445
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,520
they're trying to attack this leave
image on a particular person's computer

446
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,270
and

447
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,500
I thought it was really funny because be
didn't never actually send me any

448
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,860
updated I'd ask for

449
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,120
and I don't think I would help them but
i was just curious if I can contact the

450
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,570
defense with all this evidence that's
being mishandled

451
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,110
and and our

452
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,490
and a you know unfortunately didn't

453
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,270
but if you know anyone that works with
the immigration Customs Enforcement

454
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,320
ice division for the Department of
Homeland Security

455
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,740
on you might wanna tell them that they
have some like maybe

456
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,740
smart interns working with some maybe
smart

457
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,500
agents I but that maybe I wouldn't trust
them doing

458
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,960
law enforcement it seems kinda crazy to
contact someone over the Internet and

459
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,230
offer to send the evidence without using
an anchored

460
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,280
and I papers your day

461
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,750
and it's just

462
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:11,360
it's a unbelievable unbelievable that
they were doing

463
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,710
and I felt like it was pretty ridiculous
eventually they did say that they had

464
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:17,760
they did say that they had a warrant to
collect the computer

465
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,310
and I was really surprised because I
guess that maybe they didn't read any

466
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,810
other called

467
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,399
stuff in it only seen the vial fault
stuff but they had reimplemented the key

468
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,020
finder so

469
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,360
I guess that they didn't try I any

470
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,120
the other like thousand attacks against
Pakistan to

471
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,840
get his passwords but its kinda sort of
like an interesting

472
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,480
tension about file fall and I'm sure
they're watching this video

473
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,480
so yes I'm

474
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,840
anyway so I didn't really feel like
there is anything on ethical about any

475
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,780
this could be released an iPhone it was
a good idea because I thought it would

476
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,149
definitely push forward

477
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,870
this code good direction else about it
would push forward countermeasures

478
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,450
I really think it's a good idea to not
simply trust

479
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,020
software crypto as certified perfect
solution

480
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,120
heard someone talking about database
security other room and everything like

481
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,560
I it's great music

482
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,280
for this party unreadable

483
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,720
I don't know it's a process right so in
our

484
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,340
paper we said that it would be great if
someone wrote by us because

485
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,620
all over tools do actually have some
destruction

486
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,240
involved and you know destruction is
necessarily negative you need to destroy

487
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,920
to create

488
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,050
to paraphrase from a famous anarchist

489
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,909
but it was not what we wanted for
anything that was

490
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,780
I guess pristine copies so we didn't
ever

491
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,930
implement the virus stuff but we did
mention that if someone wanted him

492
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:54,380
to buy stuff they would be you know
useful and

493
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,700
are you need is one motherboard her
electrical tape

494
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,730
and so summitted and they contacted me
three

495
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,320
your four days ago and the road this
program is called core info

496
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,330
and it's a plugin to the Corp project

497
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,330
basically it's a BSD license library and

498
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,960
it sorry pre-built becomes and its UN
you image so you can just go to

499
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,140
Corbett dork slashed %um you

500
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,730
and there's a specifically payload

501
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:26,900
Henry probably just

502
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,960
at that and toss in QEMU started up

503
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,440
and will walk you through I love

504
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,210
the memory you can dump and Iran into
all sorts of useful stuff to by asking

505
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:37,910
you

506
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,020
and using this it would be possible to
do analysis on the K

507
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:46,200
where you didn't ramp on any of the bits
memory so you can see if certain

508
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,140
part bits state longer for example

509
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,660
things that are constantly over in by
the files in only contained by us

510
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,650
information

511
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,670
you might see it even with you unit
directional decay

512
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,050
or I do actually care whatever kind of
Decatur you're going to run into you

513
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,280
you might see that those things have

514
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,160
nom like those particular this will have
the phenomenon the predicament talk

515
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,350
about where the memory

516
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:13,280
specifically been oxidized in specific
state

517
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,290
to do more now says using this tool I
thought that was pretty great

518
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:19,490
I suggested to him that it might be
useful to you have a

519
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,430
a motherboard and for each different
electrical type flash them on the record

520
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,610
and then you can have a single memory
module decor but would you say you don't

521
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,980
even need to modify Corp

522
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,330
unloading library and then you can
simply take

523
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,610
member you want to analyze and secular
staying in the second slot after cooling

524
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,390
I and then you wouldn't somebody the
bits and you could repeat for each

525
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,790
different memory chip and you would be
able to so all the memory which is back

526
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:45,280
together

527
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,730
have an exact memory image that was the
last thing

528
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,110
at the computer did for you pull the
power so

529
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,400
thats kinda one-upping bill a little bit
but not by much

530
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,320
I but it's really great and the guy
wrote it I guess his name is hoping its

531
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,240
rehome is a guy from the case Computer
Club think

532
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,090
so he's probably going to talk about
this at 25°c 3nf

533
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,370
because I like open you haven't been to
Germany highly recommend you come to the

534
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,750
congress

535
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:17,260
it's definitely the best European and
I've ever been to

536
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:21,750
so I spent a lot of time thinking about
countermeasures against all the tools

537
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,060
that I just mentioned

538
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,020
not so much against previously had
medical by us

539
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,750
but some and I talked with a number of

540
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,150
I guess pretty smart people a lot
smarter than I am about different

541
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,500
possible countermeasures and one of the
things that a lot of people really

542
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,980
leaned on was the idea case intrusion
and I think it's bunk

543
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,250
I don't think that kissinger is really
ever going to work

544
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,300
because if know what kind of case
intrusion you

545
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,380
have you can simply raise the bar so
they have to act fast

546
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,210
before they get to the actual phenomenon
exists with this memory

547
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:59,210
you have in your machine

548
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:04,380
there's a a paper that someone wrote
Islington Metafilter post about our work

549
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,000
and basically it's the idea that you
have to serve like a

550
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,130
token basic education like you have a
phone of some sort

551
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:15,830
and you are sitting next your laptop
when you walk away you have a system day

552
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,970
minutes running and when you're

553
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,020
device reaches a certain threshold
proximity did you think it is

554
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:26,560
too far away then I love the main system
and raising her two txt and its

555
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,520
asymmetrically

556
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,540
to another key in it sent to your phone
recommended cryptid when he gets back in

557
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,500
range

558
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,810
there's a very small program that can
decrypt the memory

559
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,879
that's it that's sitting around and

560
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,010
the phone of course has some sort of
conversation with the computer and then

561
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,580
there in two cups all the memory and of
course the whole time that that's

562
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,918
happening everything you were doing on
your laptop

563
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,669
is like totally frozen and ask
completely awesome research

564
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:55,910
for very specific use cases but is not
so great for

565
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:59,429
everyone else that doesn't have this
specific set of

566
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:02,700
not using the internet now running a
server I can mail server

567
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,890
that wouldn't work for mail server at
all so it's

568
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,470
it's a creative solution by doesn't
really

569
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,040
actually help I don't think I'm and you
know what if you would say that this

570
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,570
requires physical access but

571
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,129
we live in an era where physical access
is pretty much guarantee to law

572
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,250
enforcement

573
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,200
if you recently read about any of the
National Security Letters that have been

574
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,169
handed out to you

575
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,350
ridiculous numbers organizations they
include a gag clause

576
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,910
and it's pretty much the most
undemocratic thing I can think of at the

577
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,740
moment and that's

578
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,110
saying a lot considering but the bush
administration has done in the last

579
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,200
eight years

580
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,040
but basically it means that the police
can come to your house in the middle of

581
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,760
the night because your neighbor called
them and said you're a terrorist

582
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,850
and they can analyze I love your
computer's

583
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,910
and never tell you that they were there
and so it seems to me that probably

584
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,940
physical access is something that you
really can't stop

585
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,030
and these these attacks unfortunately
are

586
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:03,178
server problem is utilities hopefully
will facilitate

587
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,580
research in a direction that will make
physical access less

588
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:11,220
interesting when you have say you don't
have a hardware token

589
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,220
so potentially there are some
workarounds but

590
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:18,070
its it's very difficult so one thing
that might be useful as temperature

591
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,390
sensors

592
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:22,799
and it cancer quest this year theater
rate

593
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,419
was talking with bill and I about
basically adding in some patches

594
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,049
to open SSH I that would allow you to
have

595
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,060
support for and advise

596
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,560
being specifically patched for kill
first

597
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,399
bit so you could say I want to all these
bits add memory to be killed first when

598
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,049
someone calls a specific panic function

599
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,800
and that's great so you can change the
threshold attack to

600
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,230
you know something like one millisecond
as opposed to just for ever sitting

601
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,199
there when an alert

602
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,870
happens usual you get like a new Lego
case has been opened

603
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,069
not so useful so it's possible that you
could have something like that combined

604
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,820
with the

605
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,880
ddr3 chips that actually have an i2c bus

606
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,120
that allows you to set an interrupt and
say like if the temperature on the chip

607
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,049
drops below a certain threshold thrown
interrupt

608
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,830
least this is what they said I haven't
seen on this chipset

609
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,460
through an interrupt and in center city
can pick it up and say oh we have a like

610
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,160
a cooling event that should never occur
and if this occurred were being attacked

611
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,990
and he put a budget I'm into clearing a
bunch of arbitrary memory that's just

612
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,280
sitting around because

613
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,830
you realize you can get it for free so
BST did take some proactive measures

614
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,259
and thats pretty useful I think

615
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,220
maybe someone else will pick them up in
the other operating systems that they

616
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,640
might use

617
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,620
but not measuring different than just a
change in graphing and over time would

618
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,549
probably be useful

619
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,980
and then when you see something that's
out of the ordinary

620
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,280
potential you can do something with it
like react for the kill

621
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,660
to first bet but basically nothing

622
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,680
is going to down a percent Minnesota
attack

623
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:02,580
and you can combine it with other other
issues and

624
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,600
anyway there's so many other things I
mention

625
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,839
the hardware crypto module is something
that's kinda nice

626
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,270
am hopeful that someone can convince
Akari to

627
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,210
work on this sort of form and are poor
woman's

628
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,350
a FPGA co-processor

629
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:24,170
because it would be nice to have a sort
of generic PCMCIA card you to slide into

630
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,190
a laptop

631
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,520
and all the crib operations take place
there all the keying everything takes

632
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,440
place in an

633
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,609
a man with a smart card for some sort of
others Asian us leaving

634
00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:35,750
key storage and then you definitely
changed

635
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:40,520
the attack service a great deal the idea
crypto coprocessors are like

636
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,580
to ganic things and

637
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,680
probably can't afford one i cant I and I
went I V NZRL

638
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,069
and answered to talk to them about it
and they

639
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,010
they said you know they thought they
could defend pretty well against this

640
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:54,800
but

641
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,180
basically the co-processor is something
that's like very

642
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,430
niche market and it isn't something
that's probably work out very well

643
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,069
for a lot of people in your software
probably want to give an end to the curb

644
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,180
co-processor so it doesn't really matter

645
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:12,210
have it to require a substantial amount
of work

646
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,710
manda of course just become slightly
harder to analyze when you put in

647
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,190
hardware and

648
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,880
mean as Carson all has shown hardware is
not something that is impossible

649
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,160
and in fact if anything it will keep out
a number of people that might see some

650
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,230
things that in their particular domain
of knowledge are

651
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,850
obvious bucks the people that work on
Harbor might not notice them as obvious

652
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,650
bucks

653
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,120
and so it it changes again for the
attacker is an

654
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,680
and who can pull off this type thing it
really

655
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,470
is in magic solutions any sort

656
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:49,180
and force fly logic can rip anything
apart if there's a problem

657
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,919
with hardware its it's done so

658
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,490
anyway I'm what would really like to see

659
00:37:56,490 --> 00:38:00,800
release but I'd like to see is all the
downloading our tools

660
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,280
and using a and if you have time

661
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,200
catalog memory chips that you're using
and the retention times that you see

662
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,990
see if using ECC memory non ECC memory
and their couple other caveats we

663
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:14,420
mention our paper

664
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,460
and make suggestions for countermeasures
so we can sort of like I

665
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,050
get on with the next generation of this
now that it's basically

666
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:27,140
possible to read all this memory even
with our out on a computer

667
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:30,230
should be interesting where people come
up with

668
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,520
I of course if you can afford liquid
nitrogen a time you can get it

669
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,000
Cana canned air and canned air usually
has the chemical tanker for FAA

670
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,400
and basically be turned upside down a
burn your finger

671
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,820
house Colbourne and if that happens you
can use that on

672
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:50,120
memory potentially safely and

673
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,839
it should call the memory significantly
and least enough for you to transfer to

674
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,530
another machine with a corporate BIOS

675
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,770
to do now sis are enough to you you know
specifically set a timer before you said

676
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,430
a week online

677
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,470
packet and send it back to do
measurements

678
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,540
so if anyone has any questions

679
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,549
take some

680
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:14,930
microphone back there back

681
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,819
kinda nervous it's Rob now

682
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:23,650
don't worry about it hello I'm it would
seem the adversary

683
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,620
a if you look at at use you seem to
dismiss case

684
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:32,200
case switches and case intrusion things
too quickly

685
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,280
up the officers well-funded the
adversary needs to spend a lot of money

686
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,010
if they built this generic case locking
solution that works for everybody

687
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,290
because of course we can study if you
can break it up

688
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,860
given that we are not well funded but
that we all know how this stuff works we

689
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,920
can all built slightly different case

690
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,620
intrusion things and the thing is if
it's a one-off yeah for sure doesn't

691
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,089
have

692
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:56,570
another case to study to see if they can
break so the

693
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:59,630
since the maker movement approach to
education turgid

694
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,980
is I think my mind is actually quite
powerful the fact that it's a one-off

695
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:07,430
is is a unique feature absolutely I
think I am

696
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,040
I don't dismiss that if you have a lot
of outside world inputs

697
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,060
and you know what you think that they
should be and you measure them

698
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,230
you might be able to find interesting
things that are useful to you

699
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:21,230
but take for example I think it's about
two hundred fifty dollars there's a

700
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,550
device that you can use

701
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,810
devil sync up with the power love a
server

702
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,830
and it also has a UPS built into it you
can also make a vampire tap for the

703
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,680
ethernet cable and basically hook

704
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,919
the internet cable into itself so you
don't lose link chop the internet cable

705
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,260
and take that power UPS devices

706
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:44,750
and role the server under the kholo and

707
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:48,180
basically take that to a place for you
have a large crowd at liquid nitrogen

708
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,410
and pull the power at the exact same
second you drop it into liquid nitrogen

709
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,589
I don't know how you can defend against
that was like one of case designs

710
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:00,240
I think that you could defend against
someone who is not going to do that but

711
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,760
that attack for the for the call Britax
specifically

712
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,120
i think is mean that's really hard to
defend against without having a secure

713
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,580
co-processor even a secure coprocessor
is only as secure as then

714
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,100
some arbitrary number that has been
pulled out like a million dollars worth

715
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,160
of equipment secure

716
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,839
and and so I definitely think for most
people what you suggest is a good idea

717
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,680
but it's

718
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,819
markers for it is a good idea

719
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,340
I like that it's possible

720
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,630
you're one of its probably gonna be
better than almost everyone else was

721
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,430
rough

722
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,549
space n arm

723
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:41,870
what has been the single best either
hardware or software

724
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,910
com implementation for resisting this
attack

725
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:48,420
you've seen so far well there really
isn't any

726
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,640
I i mean

727
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,950
to to be mars more specific you can set
a BIOS password

728
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,680
on your machine and now when someone
does your attack they can also reader

729
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:09,520
does the attack they can also read about
passer this fall

730
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:13,230
so ID I miss you actually know I

731
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,350
I reckon some saw for that regularly
beat are three keys for many many people

732
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,520
probably here in the audience

733
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,200
so my first question is what what can
programmers do to mitigate some

734
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,020
this attacked seeing the constraints of
having to read these keys

735
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,300
having to use them and my second
question is

736
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,680
I of my RC key is so the like

737
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:37,190
and indistinguishable from like random
better memory

738
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,400
so how do you actually heard you're too
sexy fine our sake is compared to die

739
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:41,930
from them

740
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,730
very carefully short answer

741
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:49,860
so in the case is being a developer and
needing to use our cities

742
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:54,090
I really think that sensor using main
system memory that has this phenomenon

743
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:57,890
your kinda trouble I mean if the key is
on and kept in memory

744
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,230
already knows if the Redbox and you have
access to the kernel

745
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,490
you can reed also it's arbitrary memory
it's nothing special

746
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,890
there's nothing new about that its
basically just the transformational

747
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,980
that into the of state and so

748
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,530
I don't know how you're going to really
pretty I'm XO

749
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,290
okay a couple people have suggested
obfuscating here believes that security

750
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:24,450
through obscurity works out raise your
hand a

751
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:31,450
we have one going back excellent

752
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,110
if you wanted to you could put your keys

753
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:40,670
in a specific part love the lower
boundary

754
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:45,840
memory that is costly initialized by
your particular proprietary

755
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,960
by us and I think that would be a
possibility but I don't think that I

756
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,630
guess I don't think that that's really

757
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,390
I don't think that's a great solution
especially if you're a free software and

758
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,609
someone like realizes that their attack

759
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:03,830
say particular phase of her project that
that has that how to measure enable that

760
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:07,200
I mean it everybody's doing different
kinda measures will make it harder for

761
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:07,450
them

762
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,840
for the analyst II support making it
harder for the analyst so

763
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,880
go for it but I don't think that you
should think it'll be

764
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,560
a good solution like I've been keeping I
King information and cash line

765
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:23,549
on a sea view might be a better idea but
that's like a fixed amount of space

766
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:25,880
putting in registers could be a fixed
amount of space

767
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,300
so yeah

768
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,190
and the person that wrote the RC key
finder world tell you about how it works

769
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,130
this is Nadia hi everybody can hear me

770
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,840
okay so the way that we recognize keys
and memories by looking for the

771
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,430
structure that the keys are stored

772
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,660
so with as: keys it happens that
everybody stores a key schedule all

773
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,200
around he's in the same order in the
exact same way

774
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,010
so if you want to hide your a S keys
break up the key schedule in some way

775
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:57,090
maybe it's too predictable but it'll
still be harder to do than we can do it

776
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:57,560
already

777
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,670
and if you want to hide our sickies so
we looked at the way that Apache does it

778
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:03,790
with open SSL

779
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:07,270
and it turns out that they sorta very
encoded sorta

780
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,640
the whole keep it without the rest of
the pack it's just the very good key

781
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,650
and so we're looking for that I don't
know about other applications that use

782
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,970
rsync is we have a look at it

783
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,500
you should look at it but if you want to

784
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,550
make sure that your not susceptible to
exactly what we're doing

785
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:29,450
just break up the information in some
way that's harder than it already is so

786
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:30,280
don't use

787
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,119
back coating your

788
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:37,140
breakup I mean security through
obscurity is it a good idea but

789
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:44,140
its better then what art we are today

790
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:53,080
that answer russian pop sorter

791
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,369
you talk about it later if you're a
couple

792
00:45:56,369 --> 00:46:00,550
people here i cant I don't actually know
a great deal about RAM

793
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:05,080
hardware by if I have to what I
understand about this is that the reason

794
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,970
you have this property taxes basically
if if the caps and %um drains slowly

795
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:12,430
so would be possible to fix this or at
least

796
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,950
have mitigated in heartened hardware if
you

797
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,740
during when RAM was Howard you held
opens

798
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,609
transistors and as soon as RAM lost how
are you allowed those too close

799
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:28,830
so that all the passengers were shorted
together so basically you tried to

800
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:32,319
for all a friend on Flickr a common
value that's the average of all

801
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,420
estimates in this

802
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,670
huge C i'd steak or something like that

803
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,990
so there are a couple of memory vendors
that have

804
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,330
that have talked with other people
they're not directly with me

805
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,810
name I don't think not with the other
people on our team either

806
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:53,200
and a have a market for this

807
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,359
there are people that you care about
this attack and so it is a possibility

808
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,529
that some other people that are involved
with that particular area of hardware

809
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:00,010
design

810
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:03,440
will come up with a solution where
they'll have a shipping costs and number

811
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,420
of dollars more

812
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,650
has this particular physical memory
retention

813
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:15,140
phenomenon I i don't think though that
will be able to do that off the bat

814
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,750
someone

815
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,780
suggested making sort of like a ram
condom like a microcontroller and a slot

816
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,880
and basically when the intrusion
detection system on the case goes off it

817
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,040
sensible to suffer event and hardware
event

818
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,650
and the hardware event would basically
right

819
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,170
to memory I think that my vehicle ID and
if someone

820
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:38,430
that was praise God with hardware want
to build it filter on

821
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:41,589
is here I prolly the

822
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:45,200
something useful but I know I think it's
limited again

823
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,540
its if you have a one-off I think you
could may pull it off

824
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,359
I think if you have like a a standard
solution you just change the tax

825
00:47:52,359 --> 00:47:53,170
services just

826
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,630
several steps you take before you do it
and again it would also require

827
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,070
power in various other things that might
be

828
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:05,660
kinda only so there was an interesting
trip in the days VAX

829
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,740
where the if you lost power the
architecture

830
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:12,800
definition required that you keep the
discs and memory and everything's

831
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,119
you up and running for three hundred
Microcenter 30 milliseconds

832
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:19,630
the way this was achieved was actually
to turn the big-spending

833
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,940
fighters abyss in the generators to
power the machine so

834
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,150
have to also look for the whole point
here is that you have a bunch

835
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:31,869
one stored in caps right you have power
on the red on the chip so perhaps you

836
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:33,740
could draw that of to help

837
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:37,080
flatten the conference chip II

838
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,180
it's possible I think at something that
would be worth looking into I mean maybe

839
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:45,379
you'd be interested in checking out the
code and finding out if you can

840
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,710
actually change the memory retention
phenomenon thank you

841
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:53,700
thank you so %ah

842
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:57,030
first of all thanks a lot for TOR really
appreciate that

843
00:48:57,030 --> 00:49:01,369
glad you guys had frank star stickers
too by the way everyone so I i'm very

844
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:03,109
glad I'm in an airport now have to

845
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,529
by something that I've got things like
that too others evil actors out there

846
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:10,810
in addition that back down

847
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:14,910
I was reading recently about to our live
CD the claim that when it shut down

848
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,940
white the memory got something like that
may realize it doesn't route remove all

849
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,030
of the possibilities for memory remnants
attack but a lot of us are a little more

850
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,740
concerned with

851
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,520
we get off the plane we have to go
through customs they're going to

852
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,910
confiscate my laptop

853
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:31,330
it be nice if I shut it down white the
encryption key memory

854
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:34,880
and it is that practical a so

855
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,020
yes and no I guess I am

856
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,280
I guess I depends what our lives to your
site you know it's minus

857
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:45,560
in a little while re-arm

858
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,279
it's possible that there's two a live CD
does I correctly I would say

859
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,470
look at the source code verifier find
out you know

860
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:55,500
who produces a whether other trustworthy
with another thurgood

861
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,890
I don't know I'm which particular one
there's a lot of stuff that you store

862
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,089
the idea is sound at least two

863
00:50:02,089 --> 00:50:05,630
help for those of us that have that
particular problem well so the

864
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,920
interesting thing about this

865
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,450
is that there's in the particular case
it or and in the case of a live CD there

866
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:12,460
are a couple of different

867
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,050
issues that you really have to face one
of them is Peter governments memory

868
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,190
residue issue basically your

869
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:25,190
oxidizing the RAM salt in a particular
way so I don't know if that particularly

870
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,480
protected because you're not overwriting
the memory a number of times you're not

871
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,880
like changing the parents

872
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,780
by default soared in that a chip for
someone who's just trying to reboot the

873
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,330
machine

874
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:39,740
like but say you're an internet cafe and
someone wrote it will so that whenever

875
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,080
someone logged off the computer
automatically rebooted and like

876
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:47,020
grab the memory you know I don't know
detect memory faults or something

877
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,140
I'm it seems to me that probably

878
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,609
it would protect against that threat if
it was allowed to get into the shutdown

879
00:50:54,609 --> 00:50:55,650
dirty

880
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:58,890
obviously if you can get to the shutdown
13 like if your server that doesn't

881
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,118
really help

882
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:03,550
so what happens is yours might help
against a particular adversary have a

883
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:04,640
person who

884
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:09,740
is going to color she went on and you've
been able to take proactive measures

885
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,910
the other question I had Korea

886
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:17,500
Sam Wright I actually had a chance to
try out the acecomm 32 version

887
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,819
stopped over most the low memory but
that

888
00:51:20,819 --> 00:51:24,560
I did find it was pretty cool while I
was going through and testing and trying

889
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,160
to figure out how to make it work I
actually had the laptop I was using to

890
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:27,569
test

891
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:30,800
all for probably close to 10 minutes

892
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,380
and while most the memory came back is
complete nerd garbage I did

893
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:38,099
holy user agent string I E seven out a
bit

894
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:41,119
have you ever had something like that I
mean that is a

895
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,150
really long time awesome valuable out
yeah

896
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,830
yes explain yeah I mean older think
that's have

897
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,990
much longer data retention times than
you think that's

898
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:54,770
which are almost non-existent I'm

899
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:58,680
yeah I mean you know it's interesting
I'd like to see a

900
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,839
for map it all the different memory and
whether or not you know

901
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:05,220
by default and therefore that it's an
how to behave so I think I'll be really

902
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:06,040
useful &

903
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:09,890
it's a really big problem to try to map
all the memories it's in use by all the

904
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:12,118
people in the audience without the
participation

905
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,520
so if people wanna help that would be
really useful be really hard to do

906
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,960
without their participation

907
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:22,369
thanks just briefly I do most the
discussion so far is centered around

908
00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:26,950
PC architecture and variants thereof but
his any discussion

909
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:31,589
rain discovery research involved us
interaction in bed two systems is

910
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:33,500
specifically security-related like

911
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,109
in case a smart cards are in my case lee
USB

912
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:40,848
um crypto token involve not necessarily
with the

913
00:52:40,849 --> 00:52:44,500
stored private chibi anytime that you
have to deal with session key been

914
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,490
generated

915
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:48,890
that you know any dynamic profession has
to be done on the

916
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:52,470
from the teeny little device here to the
computer itself

917
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,869
into the computer itself in sniffing any
that I'm

918
00:52:55,869 --> 00:52:59,089
so we can particularly work on another
so bills day job is working on the

919
00:52:59,089 --> 00:53:00,060
experts

920
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:03,380
so i mean one of the things that he
talks about on a regular basis when it

921
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,300
comes to beer evidences that

922
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,780
after scrub memory even on embedded
systems when this phenomenon is

923
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,300
something that is

924
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:15,349
and so electrical phenomenon memory so
it's not limited to

925
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:18,510
x86 it's just that are tools are limited
x86

926
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,560
on and as far as smart cards I mean
smart card is only as strong as

927
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:27,770
I guess Chris from fly logic whether or
not his attacker

928
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:31,030
I will would basically I wouldn't I
wouldn't trust anything

929
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:34,950
like that he has a successfully attacked
to see to beat everything pretty much

930
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,109
that he tries

931
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:40,220
and most hardware also has we're debug
pads and back doors

932
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,400
you know so like a

933
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:47,180
to talk about this only thing

934
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:50,460
okay so siddig as a member there

935
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:53,890
years however the Kinkos car

936
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:59,618
so there's a I'm sorry to ruin this for
anyone who cares

937
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:03,510
that ship is the best GF in the whole
world

938
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:06,490
basically I'm there's a specific debug
pat the bat

939
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:09,660
as a single gate preventing it from
telling you

940
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,000
the seeker 24-bit code that prevents you
from doing things to the car

941
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,100
and all you have to do is know where the
fuck that is and then you can get the

942
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:19,910
24-bit code when you for the card on

943
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:25,598
so smart cards not so smart baby

944
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,200
after last the move would be safe to say
that

945
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,819
which you can probably follow up on an
even more I I want it at that

946
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:34,839
that unlike computers most smart card
readers

947
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:37,880
do have secure key storage so did

948
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:41,640
crypto coprocessors is reality most
market applications

949
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:44,788
and relies on some secret

950
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:49,670
obscure algorithm to encrypt case Booker
that would be a nice reversing target

951
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,019
future but but

952
00:54:51,019 --> 00:54:55,079
those so far believed to be very secure
well

953
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:58,690
who could possibly reverse engineer some
proprietary secret I

954
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:02,970
hardware Carson maybe you did that
already

955
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,299
I'm

956
00:55:06,299 --> 00:55:10,970
you mentioned earlier to ECC memory and
you could hear went over it

957
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:14,059
saying that the city was also vulnerable
but that some

958
00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:18,619
ships that were actually wiping webbing
know that and I was wondering if you

959
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:19,640
could elaborate on

960
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:23,980
where is the series the LIBOR book is so

961
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,849
actually I think you see memory is a
special case for never reasons because

962
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:29,230
it makes people feel secure

963
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:34,660
when they're not and it does some things
that at certain times will be useful to

964
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:35,160
users

965
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:40,078
cares about the confidentially come
confidentiality of their memory I'm

966
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,359
basically I'm when it comes down to it
ECC memory

967
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,288
if it apply like the way that intel has
a they've invented

968
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:50,349
programming specification I have on my
shelf basically

969
00:55:50,349 --> 00:55:53,489
what it says is that when you power on
the chip

970
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:56,680
the first thing you should do a scrub
the chips because there's going to be

971
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:57,769
all sorts of bits

972
00:55:57,769 --> 00:56:01,239
also to different states mostly on of

973
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:05,539
and essentially if you are using uses
the memory

974
00:56:05,539 --> 00:56:08,539
what that means use if you have a
controller that does that

975
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:11,970
and your control is going to take an
hour perhaps your BIOS will take care

976
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,009
it's coming out as well

977
00:56:13,009 --> 00:56:18,539
on but what's right what's really bad in
my opinion though is that

978
00:56:18,539 --> 00:56:23,150
it seems possible to me that you can use
the air cracked a

979
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:26,249
have both

980
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:29,430
the code republished and also

981
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:33,569
the fact that it's easy Memory Inc
incorrect cares for you and hardware

982
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:36,680
I'm so if you were to not scrub the
controller and then

983
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:40,559
apply that air crash in that hardware
and then also

984
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:43,700
you wanna to apply as: fixing

985
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,249
it seems like you could get more
Pittsburgh since we're not really seeing

986
00:56:47,249 --> 00:56:48,670
a lot of data loss it's

987
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,680
it just means that you might feel little
bit secured sometimes so

988
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,789
as an answer question article

989
00:56:55,789 --> 00:57:02,789
anybody else

990
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:09,220
you can

991
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,690
is it possible to use any of these on
say a PlayStation 3

992
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:18,450
a place general election and then have
place so you wanna analyze the memory of

993
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,600
the game the reading

994
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,730
know physically like I'm thinking about
a different picture because

995
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,060
128 bit or 64 bits forces 32bits

996
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:30,270
RAM I mean the you something special

997
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:33,960
different so if you have to stand memory
chips and

998
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,820
in whatever game console you're looking
and selectively compatible with a

999
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,560
particular BIOS there's no reason that
you

1000
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,160
should be able to swap it out whether or
not that it will be meaningful to you I

1001
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,680
guess

1002
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,760
depends on if you understand what it's
doing but I think that you should

1003
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,290
probably be able to modify tests so that
you can

1004
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,670
mean mimics PlayStation should be
possible to set it up to do

1005
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:57,280
in some way over the network and you can
see yourself you can also just a review

1006
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,620
to PlayStation running Linux

1007
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:02,390
and see if the memory persists it's
possible that they don't scrub the

1008
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,799
memory

1009
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,230
when they rebuild and if that's the case
let us know

1010
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,410
be kinda cool to find out that there's a
game system that has this phenomenon

1011
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:13,920
so think that's

1012
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,140
it thank you very much
