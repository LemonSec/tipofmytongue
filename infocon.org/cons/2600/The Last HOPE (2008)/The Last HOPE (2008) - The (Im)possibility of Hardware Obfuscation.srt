1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,190
with little bit later on also the allies
not going to have a studio via what we

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,830
call the fourth track the on schedule
track we have to reschedule praxis you

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,599
go to steer

4
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,940
beautiful program this time around the
fourth track you can sign up for what

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,649
we're calling

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,310
um the fourth track room Zeus room

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,959
just after the right there and I feel
free to sign up if you want to

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,400
talk and I didn't get yourself on
schedule so i think thats all I want to

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,620
mention in terms of announcements up
front

10
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,620
let's go ahead with our first talk
person

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,219
thank you very much for the introduction
yeah

12
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:44,239
I'm cost nor and I University of
Virginia I'd like to

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,640
in this fayed to you today how

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,420
we'll reverse engineered small

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,600
silicon chips and no one in touch if a
man with with

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,579
other ships today to add to the
knowledge of reverse engineering and I

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:00,260
wanna take

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,580
mostly awake a desk at many people have
of hot granted

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,520
the belief that by putting something in
hot where it would actually be

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,110
hard to reverse and it would be up for
skating out be mostly talking bout

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:14,909
algorithms

22
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,470
I'm other photography but anything

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,960
felt able equally apply to any other
algorithm that you want to reverse

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,009
engineer from safe

25
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,170
a graphics processor from the sound card
from from the seat no

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,200
encoding decoding any of that and

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,240
so if you have some piece of hardware
that you don't know exactly what it's

28
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,568
doing anyone to find out

29
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:38,200
how this is where you learn how to do it
and

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,479
as a motivation for why we have been

31
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,909
looking at this intensely from security
perspective

32
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,020
is that that there are a lot of
algorithms out there that our

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,060
proprietary

34
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,840
and that hidden away in hot where so
nobody can find them so nobody can break

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,009
our system well

36
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,640
that turns out to not be true and in
fact by hiding waiting

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,049
agrees and they usually turn out to be
very weak since they were developed in

38
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,710
in the back room by a few people they
didn't exactly consider all

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,900
possible attack vectors and will to
watch the and look at a couple of

40
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,900
weaknesses that we have found and it
took that we reverse

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,519
so now I which optimally want you to
today walk away with all the point is

42
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,130
needed to study on river think

43
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,470
effort and if you have any question
throughout the top piece of them

44
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:29,650
and find okay now

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,109
as a motivating example are we talking
but arafat detect these

46
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:36,440
is this little tiny chips that have

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,069
all but one functionality:
identification they send out a static

48
00:02:40,069 --> 00:02:40,640
number

49
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,840
every time to harvest and in fact and
the technology in in the better if

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,730
that's some

51
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,119
some manifestation of our for detect
notice happen to have a battery

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,190
they come in even smaller form factors
where

53
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,859
not even a better you would fit and so
they're basically the smallest copper

54
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,030
you could possibly find

55
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,949
which makes an optimal for reverse
engineer sense there's only

56
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,790
a very small piece of art we have to
look at and

57
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,418
you know project now we looked at the
the my fat classic RFID chip

58
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:17,239
and very widely deployed caught that
issues for access control into buildings

59
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,329
for payment

60
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,250
for example Voice a cut in London today
he's right it's you

61
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,600
that fat semi-fat classic chip and a
number of other

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,620
and smart codification and

63
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,850
in a project now we reverse engineer at
that that

64
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,709
ship to fine arts how how secure it
actually isn't that so widely used for

65
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,100
Wallace security-related application and

66
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,030
I have we did take it one step further
than and also exploit a couple of days

67
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,389
on a bit of 275 using some are for the
reader heartbreak that was actually

68
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:51,820
manufacture this is

69
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,959
designed by the same time you left me
that group who built the specters of

70
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,600
designed to better us and now

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,090
back to to the topic at hand how do you
have essentially hot

72
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,650
well first we gotta get the chips to
silicon chips and

73
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,060
are traditionally come in a plastic card
most most

74
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,019
on microcontrollers microchips would
come in the plastic packaging

75
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,090
so first one to get rid of it classic
and

76
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,519
a couple of all actions some solutions I
will

77
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,710
well get rid of their that that the
classic entirely for you well even get

78
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,719
this so we can take

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,759
yet a more elegant where getting getting
go silicon chip this

80
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,610
just to buy the plain chips most most
manufacturers of smart that for instance

81
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,669
well not also manufactured antenna for
instance

82
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,549
today there are some some I'd you can
buy the plank ships if he claimed to

83
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,720
to be in the business of attaching an
accident so we got some black chips

84
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,660
eventually but well supplied onto luck
with his actions

85
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,740
which can be dangerous at times but a
lot of fun too

86
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,160
now getting getting the chip out

87
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,300
I'm that the ship will look something
like that

88
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,820
I'm not all that impressive this is my
friendship

89
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,270
it's about one millimeter by one
millimeters it's a tiny tiny plate of

90
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,859
silica

91
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,180
and only see from the outside really I

92
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,710
if you connect us and out but you take
only has two expected to it actually

93
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,070
attend so that's not all that impressive

94
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,270
but if you if he him in a little bit and
we cut out a little

95
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,849
will work on it here and you do see that
inside of this

96
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,430
this ship there is some structure so
there's just something some metal wire

97
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,960
running across here and there some other
way is that they come in and

98
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,789
go out of this shit and that's exactly
did have a shock to everyone in reverse

99
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,540
engineering of

100
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,780
so inside this chick that some some 3d
structure that encodes a sec

101
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,240
an electronic circuit consisting just of

102
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,290
chances of different sizes and wires
that connect the strategist

103
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,460
that's all a microchip ever have now to
get to DC

104
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,979
the strangest s audit the wires before
the transistors

105
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,430
me too to slide that the chick week need
to take away layer by layer early and

106
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,560
take pictures

107
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,790
aptos made a life interest now

108
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,660
we're awesome a number of times whateva
believe that we use all

109
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,820
how expensive tho focused ion beam is
and all that we don't need any of that

110
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,389
took these pictures were taken with an
elegant microscope but you clearly don't

111
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,990
need an electron microscope to

112
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,290
to do any reversing Wendys pictures
other than looking cool have

113
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,550
had no effect on on our project
whatsoever this

114
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,240
this with a cutout was stunned as a
focused ion beam to get about three

115
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,860
hours so you can imagine

116
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,880
what do the whole chip with a focused
ion beam take months

117
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,110
yes indeed makes so you wanna get a

118
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,470
someone rougher than that and she put
that I'm

119
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,600
and all you need really is some
sandpaper

120
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,080
or policy pace to open its chip

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,270
to stop by Fuqua did all that work in in
Berlin he exited

122
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,409
to Disney polishing machine way but some
some polishing solution down in the

123
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,490
treatment of that

124
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,120
and we'll move to ditch a very slowly
over to the solution

125
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,130
and very controlled take off today that

126
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,630
layer by layer you can use sandpaper to
no problem go to Lowes get to find this

127
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,990
possible sandpaper

128
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,940
that will do it I'm one thing you get a

129
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,000
because this was so is I'm dead

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,830
you don't want to chip to ever be tilted
and by telling me.

131
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:30,719
to mention this shift to be from 3d
structure like a building

132
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,860
and now if it still did you cut through
different flaw said the same time

133
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,000
diagonally

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,880
K see don't want that issue 1 one nice
pictures of each layer

135
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,960
and that you can imagine how a few if
your chip is only and the media

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,110
square have hot to handle the way

137
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:51,190
South got around this as he put it that
that chip

138
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,280
any a block of plastic female that some
plastic around it and then

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,410
and then had to this figure of che that
you could then

140
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:02,080
I'm very very plainly I'm polish

141
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,130
I for that if your job is too small to
handle that that's probably what would

142
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,169
you wanna do too

143
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:10,270
I think it's an ingenious yet of stuff
so

144
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,830
and if this picture kind of shows the
first first images we had

145
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:18,530
and we did have some till CC the blank
so we came down here

146
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,340
and kind of two substrate and a few
transistors Appiah

147
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,400
kinda that the first floor of the
building and then up his second foul

148
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,389
with with some

149
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,880
some Wyoming I and that's clearly too
much help

150
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,469
now once when he do you cut layer by
layer

151
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,589
you want to take pictures in between 22
reconstruct this ship later

152
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,019
and for that you can use it's simple
optical microscope to know

153
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,149
no electron microscope needed at least
not for the

154
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,560
for for their size of transistors you'll
find in

155
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,630
an hour for the text for example pentium
chip or something

156
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,959
might be different value you need
someone to benefit from it

157
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,260
I'm very cheap his microphone till
you'll find a min

158
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,589
most laps definitely be over a thousand
dollars we just plus we bought one for

159
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,410
11 funds for 200 yourself a few but

160
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,579
but that's all you need including the
camera that and some sandpaper to

161
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:12,639
to kick off your you're approaching I'm

162
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,339
see take this images and we took him
with the one mega pixel camera

163
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:20,579
and so in one mega pixel you don't get
all that that much every of teachers so

164
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:21,379
you have

165
00:09:21,379 --> 00:09:24,910
a number of two pictures at that that
together

166
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,100
foot describe one chip play and the next
logical step is centerstage those

167
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,019
together

168
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:34,600
miss an open source software again as
useful panorama photography

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,559
did to the top really well and didn't
need much

170
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,860
many 0 I'm infection from us hell

171
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,819
and then the last seven in this image
I'm capturing faces

172
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,939
did just different layers have to be
aligned so that

173
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:52,809
I'm to different stores have to building
actually fit on top of each other web

174
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:56,110
weather ship and then inferior

175
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,759
you have visual representation of the
chips functionality

176
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,749
but you don't still know what it's
changed since you should Monza images

177
00:10:03,749 --> 00:10:04,249
and

178
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,850
and no no one can structure to it from

179
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,589
I'm kinda human sacrifice and and so
that if

180
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:15,019
but the chip those unstructured laos I'm

181
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,800
six of them and total and the lowest
layer what would would have two

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,869
transistors transistors VDC switches

183
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:25,449
every microchip and consists of and
those trends assist

184
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,730
would be grouped into logic logic
functions will talk about those in

185
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,040
on the next life and on on the logic
play so

186
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,368
today you said see some structure and
then the next layers on top of that

187
00:10:37,369 --> 00:10:40,050
three layers total in this case

188
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,769
only do you think a connect those
different logic function

189
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,920
been and function of function any of
that and so the day

190
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,029
somehow connected to form a sec its
diagram really

191
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,139
and then the last player has no
practical functionality other than

192
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:56,670
connecting to Nintendo

193
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,469
but it does have some some on visual
protection so you can have them

194
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,369
we have done without opening to chip
since the last player

195
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:09,619
prevented from looking into it where the
rest of the trip is really just a lasso

196
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:12,759
you can you can see maybe see that fed
on

197
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:16,829
that the one layer for example the
horizontal I guess shine through to this

198
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:20,269
to this layaway with all vertical I

199
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,089
yeah so we cannot at our quest I'm

200
00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:28,199
no I said is this transistors a

201
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,819
a structured into logic function in what
we call this logic function

202
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:35,179
selfshot gates and and

203
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,429
actually every functionalities only
implemented

204
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,920
once and we look exactly the same have
its instantiated and this only

205
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,699
a few upload a couple of of logic
functions that I implemented to build a

206
00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:48,480
microchip

207
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,129
see justice will be I've been
programming concepts a function that

208
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,600
takes a small set of human values

209
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,170
and outputs one who in value okay so in
this case

210
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,759
would be a function that takes for
imports at PCs yellow dots

211
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,149
and then that this I am output pet what
would have been up for that is computed

212
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:07,869
as

213
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:11,019
I guess unless all of these are

214
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:14,850
hi it will be a one and if the Ohio will
be easier

215
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,459
so it's a it's an and after four values
and then

216
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,100
inversion I and the homie a number of
those

217
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,220
said they have at most I think 607
inputs

218
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,660
and even given truth table wise dunno
that many possibilities

219
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,999
so now every time this form and is
instantiated undertaker will look

220
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,129
exactly the same

221
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:38,239
so this is the same as this sometimes
it's its are rotated sometimes it's

222
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:38,980
Miran

223
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,809
all rotated or both I'm but they will
look the same

224
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:46,110
so with that is how we can use the
computer not to

225
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,239
to to do the recognition for us and
business

226
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:52,309
this is actually the output of of a
matlab script that

227
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:55,368
but so all it does is I

228
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:58,509
once you you select one of T cells it
will tell you

229
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:01,809
including million rotation and
everything where

230
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:04,999
on the chip this this a new cell is
located

231
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:08,509
using some template matching algorithm
so you do that

232
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,869
once you get those for so it makes US to
like this one so it's said

233
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:16,129
he again and they are you do that a
couple of times and you

234
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:20,420
you fill the Chip Foose was I'm in
sensations of the

235
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,779
of the same logic gates and there's only
total of 70

236
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:28,309
and dose seventy makeup day the standard
cell library

237
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:33,059
and so every time that day design of
this shit needs a phone and it will take

238
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,019
that same

239
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,540
49 an effin assembly instructions for
and then

240
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,689
instantiated and we can reconstruct the
whole assembly language

241
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:45,819
I'm automatically using this tool

242
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,249
now so once we did that we basically
have a map of

243
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:52,290
of where what for type of of

244
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,110
i'm gay dislocate we don't yet know
dough is what functionality is computed

245
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,899
I told you this was a fun night but how
do I know that

246
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,009
well over his briefly nephew

247
00:14:05,009 --> 00:14:08,569
more questions we'll get back to that
later but I just wanted to illustrate

248
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:12,100
that this is in hot

249
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,279
I'm this is an invalid and what i'm
showing here as

250
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,249
the leftmost picture as I'm I is the
transistor layer

251
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:23,439
and the rightmost picture is to delay a
profit

252
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:27,179
where with that the input and output so
I connected and did the picture in the

253
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:28,819
middle bless those two images

254
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:31,959
and orange that the high level and
include a lower level

255
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:35,739
and now and he said he had a dissenting
vote

256
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:40,019
anybody hasn't has anybody taken a VLSI
class

257
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:44,519
something like that yeah

258
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,449
okay well what in in a sec K built from
transistors

259
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:52,619
what would and if I don't feel basically

260
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:55,879
we Group Inc

261
00:14:55,879 --> 00:14:59,679
okay so yeah the truth favor would be if
you put a zero at the important

262
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,689
one comes out on you for the one at the
input is your caps up

263
00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:08,179
right so if you had taken VLSI class you
should be able to

264
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:11,839
to find dysfunctional too trivial
unfortunately and

265
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,269
this have a image didn't really
available publicly

266
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,799
I'm so when when I taught VLSI we can
find any

267
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,029
any any decide in that case we only we
can only find really old images

268
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:26,509
and these are usually kept secret but
yes it in focus

269
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:29,689
easy and I'll give you a couple of
course he so that does

270
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:32,860
just two transistors one up here one
down here

271
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,540
and a transistor its like button if you
press the button

272
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,980
current can flow through if you don't
press the back button is basically

273
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,910
blocked

274
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,170
so also giving you that to him that
justice

275
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:47,660
positive voltage up here and grown folks
down here

276
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,410
so now let's take the annotation from
from this

277
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,899
image and say this was the input City
import

278
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,199
I'm as you can see in this image is
kinda in the middle so connected

279
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,549
to get to two buttons makes it too where
you press

280
00:16:03,549 --> 00:16:07,759
which makes sense so this is a artistry
guess action and that the left like of

281
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,850
dis transistors

282
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,989
is the output of why in this case

283
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:15,589
so now we said why should be the
opposite of a if we do

284
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:19,259
0 one comes out 10 comes out now

285
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:23,959
looking just at the bottom transistor
fun now if you press the button

286
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:27,739
right if you put the voltage on its it
will

287
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:31,279
let coming through which means it will
connect the left like to write like in

288
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:32,290
the right like this

289
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,709
connected to ground so if you push the
button

290
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,799
out but will become negative

291
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:44,249
I now the cannister on the other side
exactly the opposite is little

292
00:16:44,249 --> 00:16:47,449
this little a sec or here says

293
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,600
its it's kind of a reverse button so if
you don't press it will let come through

294
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,629
in a few president will block

295
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:56,859
which now I can make sense if you don't
press it this

296
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:00,949
that it will connect the left like to
write like which is connected to

297
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:04,220
22 positive voltage right so

298
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,130
if you press it 0 come out if you don't
present one will come on

299
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,230
at the body functions and all gates will
be

300
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,559
so much for this is obviously did the
smallest possible what

301
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:20,280
but so more complicated gauge would have
to try and assist on each side

302
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,730
and this one for example has the output
in the middle so if he's of these

303
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,980
buttons this press

304
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,809
will connect to do it up to two ground
that the tune of

305
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:31,940
okay and chips bye bye following this he
can

306
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,730
you can you can figure out any gates
functionality and

307
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,770
actually they look very structured 223
naw

308
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,210
would just be the same but a little
white and so forth now

309
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,750
I want for you with any more details
here but if you're if you are

310
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,559
interested I put all that information
online just this morning

311
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,080
at is a weakened you and

312
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,350
I hope you will use it so we can do he
definitely if you're interested in

313
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,010
learning about

314
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,059
VLSI as I said it's hard to get these
images and

315
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,178
we couldn't find any when we were
teaching it and

316
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:06,960
so I want you to to to study this else
understands how to work

317
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,990
to maybe compare cells have different
and effector see

318
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,159
what we're different rate of the issue
and then also use these to reverse

319
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:15,340
engineer on

320
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,928
text so this this is the only and in all

321
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,120
reverse engineering system this is the
only stat that eliminates manual

322
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,200
intervention

323
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,669
probably because this is fun solving
this puzzle so we have never automatic

324
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:27,210
that

325
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,500
but so partly because it also requires
some knowledge

326
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,799
so if if he if you do get at your own
I'm

327
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,830
deal as reverse engineering do you see
senator and contribute back

328
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:43,360
hope help populate day there's a weakens
you

329
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,440
so back to back to have essentially what
we have

330
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,110
is no a map of all the different logic
functions on that

331
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,980
that logically but there's still three
layers and about that that

332
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,659
where these different functions that
interconnect

333
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:02,070
and so those those are crucial to the
functionality as much as that the lodge

334
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,580
itself

335
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,610
up so what we won now is 22

336
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:09,340
combined information of what gate so
where with a combination of what is

337
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,360
connected to what

338
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,940
an unreconstructed sector type:
something like this this representation

339
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,370
now hope for this chip that we reverse
we did that manually

340
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:22,919
it's a tiny chip so it was still
possible but and it was a

341
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,330
good go way of building some ground
truth that we can now build tool set

342
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,449
a try to get the same result but it did
take a lot of time

343
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,850
and we did do it would make a couple of
hours for that there wasn't so much over

344
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,809
promises as a couple of safety net so
for example

345
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:42,730
I'm to outputs will never be connected
to each other

346
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,500
all think Republic he everything will be
very structured surface some pickup in

347
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,389
the structure

348
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:51,330
you know he made an error and well week
maybe that

349
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:55,000
fifteen hundred times or other stuff but
the dead mostly 1500 time

350
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,190
to to find did this chips I'm
functionality and

351
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,720
so just to illustrate how much after
that could be

352
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,380
now stopping at this level but here and
has an inferred to

353
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,570
and a 20 I think and

354
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,600
we want to know where it's connected so
we

355
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,710
my feet in a green dot which means it's
connected to something up of it it's

356
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:22,130
it's a connection between these two
flaws and so we go away above it

357
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:26,769
and we see it's going to laugh and again
a green audiences coming up again

358
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:30,450
one not mean that it's coming for those
I going all the way cross here

359
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:34,470
and now it's an ABS agendas I it
grossman may head down and in fact

360
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,730
there's a green dot

361
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,230
going a little faster down here next
tonight is going to pick an easy its

362
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,690
second is no structure to its all

363
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,850
all super random almost and then

364
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,500
it's finally reaching this thought so
now we know that this study is connected

365
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,700
to decide and

366
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,980
now imagine decision under construction
in 20 we did all the Mac that

367
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,990
and giving the image on the left it will
work

368
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,289
pretty much under right where and it
takes all the wires

369
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:04,350
and green and the eighties DD's well
what is

370
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,669
agree not in the left image as a as a
record here and

371
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:10,720
just given that you can and you can
easily find it

372
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,320
dissected diagram and me time from this
is a scene Berlin

373
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,428
wrote a nice sorry for that too and
which

374
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,740
I hope will be released some sometime
this year

375
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,149
perhaps in Berlin in December good
conference to come to

376
00:21:25,149 --> 00:21:28,929
and and this this bill will eventually
even

377
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:31,980
extract the circuit diagram so do some
checking of

378
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,340
of what is possible how the different
layers are connected and so forth

379
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,519
supernatural and a much as you can
easily get it was a two hundred-year-old

380
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,690
microscope you should be able to profess
young chips

381
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,740
before we switch gears to live it has
that have any questions so far

382
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,009
yeah actually good

383
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:56,440
boy

384
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,430
I'd say so the question is who read the
big manufacturers

385
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:03,610
am down know that many make many factors
of microchips

386
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:07,330
so info clearly would be one AMD will be
one I'm

387
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:10,500
ID and many factors said I think

388
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,910
but if you are a little smaller than
that those without contract to to the

389
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,480
larger ones and that this a few
dedicated

390
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,560
chip manufacturers like on sq Mike Rupp
and so forth but

391
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:25,290
only I would say less than 20 in the
world and

392
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,540
which is interesting offered in Philly
considered since if there's only twenty

393
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,920
many factors in the world

394
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,470
we should be able to exhaustively
collect all the lodge itself from all

395
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,810
these these manufacturers

396
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,080
exchange was different process
technologies

397
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,280
but this so I would say less than a
hundred library so we have to collect

398
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,620
me person by doing p.m.

399
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,120
yeah I the star which uses mami
everything

400
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,140
processors yeah I don't know if yes

401
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,790
this manufactured on ships night were by

402
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,500
no see yeah

403
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,050
well does chips we look at up from an XP
which is

404
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:08,700
which was previously Philips
Semiconductors and

405
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,880
and day and Infineon are the big
European once

406
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,980
St micro to nationally

407
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,270
you you notice

408
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,330
mostly ships

409
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,330
signs all roads

410
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,679
yeah who dis

411
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,570
somewhere

412
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,460
how ship yeah that's an excellent that's
the question is can we

413
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:40,970
info at dead that design tool that was
used to build his chips and

414
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:44,630
since the harvard is pretty much random
I'm

415
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,400
I wouldn't see what would she say could
use plus

416
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,510
there really is only one software that
everybody is using

417
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,629
on this level cadence if couple of
smaller one said universities my views

418
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,520
but yeah this is pretty much guarantee
to to come out of some version of

419
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,240
cadence

420
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,360
in the back

421
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,590
how history manufacture hope is that the
net effect is that a question

422
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:17,260
well that the manufacture of this ship

423
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,879
they just today lost in Los you trying
to I'm

424
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,930
prevent the publication of this result
said they were

425
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:30,930
fifth a question yeah

426
00:24:37,169 --> 00:24:38,879
going to make sure this to

427
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:42,289
stays up well I hosted on my

428
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:46,840
my universities sever so you want a

429
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:53,840
take it down sued the university

430
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,850
no I don't I don't think

431
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:02,789
anybody truly believe said you can and
prevent reverse engineering results from

432
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:03,779
becoming public

433
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,909
does there are no trade secrets that you
could have five cents

434
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:12,669
we we found two secret ourselves to
manufacture didn't tell us to secret

435
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:17,309
there's no copyright that if there are
no no trademarks win French

436
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,678
jus kno no legal grounds and has said
that the lawsuit was one today

437
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,210
in the Netherlands where for an XP CD
University of

438
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,710
they could use DMCA could could I use
DMCA I think he's ever used to protect

439
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,480
of

440
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,139
right mission yeah you reverse
engineering is a creature

441
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:39,330
50 issue right so DMCA could be a pipe
thread

442
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,840
from what I understand universities are
exempted from DMCA

443
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,159
yeah so yeah we were joking about this
and that somebody should just effort

444
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,429
that is my fat tag

445
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:54,580
on a CD as a copyright protection and
they would have had

446
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,439
much more legal grounds to to tissue
anybody who would believe that

447
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,619
many okay

448
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:09,619
red passion and that kinda with me to
the next light so

449
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:16,519
one impossible defense claim against
what we are doing is to make the ship's

450
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,710
huge and to spread out that that the 1i
would resume your after across the

451
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,539
entire picture

452
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:25,489
so that would clearly defeat that the
set of tools we have now

453
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:30,200
is whenever aimed for scalability it
would take a lot more time

454
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,590
and I will take a lot more automation to

455
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,590
to to reverse something like a into
microprocessor but the stakes are much

456
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,230
higher

457
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,109
so mention you found a backdoor in in
the press is this something about

458
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,119
functionality

459
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,649
the bed alright if I respect that works
completely independent of

460
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:51,359
operating system virus scanner or any of
that but just

461
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,739
applying a certain sequence of of
instruction so

462
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:58,409
maybe somebody months to pick up the
challenge of making this came a little

463
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:00,100
too too much lot of chips

464
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:05,220
I and love will find something that is
the I think has baskets really think and

465
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,609
a but along the same lines I'm at

466
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:13,649
hack in the box I'm yeah well other
defenses that you could

467
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:17,440
I'm use against of well that that other

468
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,759
defenses that attempt it to YouTube make
sure we're doing more difficult

469
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,129
is to be just generally obfuscated ship
makes things much less structured

470
00:27:26,129 --> 00:27:29,600
do a run of 26 taking on that

471
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,850
since we already automated detection
arduous don't care whether

472
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,980
it make sense I'm not from a human
perspective if to say so connected it

473
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,179
will find a connection

474
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,230
so this doesn't really I'm for prevent
what we're doing

475
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,690
at all now another thing on a lot of

476
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,879
that to tamper resistant and approve
chips to

477
00:27:49,879 --> 00:27:53,470
have put a lot of dummy functionality on
a chip to say instead

478
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,470
that might look like that they did
they'd extend the algorithm what one way

479
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:57,950
or another

480
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,059
but they're not never actually use again
arch walls

481
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,779
if if something doesn't contribute to
the output of sunblock

482
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:09,609
we will not detected as as needed to
describe the algorithm so

483
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:13,960
this is mostly history to throw people
but that no manually

484
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,609
inspect ships safe not much additional
if

485
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:22,439
just looking at ships and inferring
functionality of us engineering

486
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,049
now well it is that much chips with
would completely defeat what we're doing

487
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:30,359
at this stage since we have aim for
scalability

488
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,918
and then fun thing that always comes out
as well just make the ship

489
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,240
kill itself once when somebody starts
opening it an idea that best

490
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,730
make sense I'm and in very high-cost

491
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,799
I'm key storage kind of like TPMS

492
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,090
but alleged mock spends it would have
been battery on it and some

493
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,879
some sentencing I'm as to whether they
were open and not an

494
00:28:51,879 --> 00:28:56,619
and as soon as they opened at the keys
will be deleted are uniquely race memory

495
00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:00,369
so that way but you can't destroyed just
that 100 subs

496
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:03,450
makes it is a completely different
things taken

497
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,739
yes would you would need to do is kind
of like it I'm

498
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:10,349
at da Vinci type approach for you ever
buy it was something you can and

499
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:14,009
physically break that shit but I don't
think that has ever been done

500
00:29:14,009 --> 00:29:17,269
so

501
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:20,970
in in conclusion and as as far as common
measures go

502
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,070
I'm we having

503
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,019
run across ideas that were completely
prohibited what we're doing other than

504
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:31,879
to scale up you could you could make
years

505
00:29:31,879 --> 00:29:35,619
contain traces that are visually their

506
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:38,740
victory here you can't mess with with
the fact that

507
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,099
electrical noise and visual I'm

508
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:48,289
from that is kind of the idea of

509
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:52,919
dummy cells dodo so ft not to be
connected to the rest of the chip

510
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,119
but then and what you preach racism

511
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,200
material that looks exactly visually to
your picture looks like a trace

512
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,809
right looks like a soap which is just is
electrically work so-so

513
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:08,428
I ideas 22 to make it so that

514
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:11,749
if you take a picture of two children
would look like there is a trace who

515
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:13,249
really that isn't well

516
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:16,599
microchip some very simple all that they
have

517
00:30:16,599 --> 00:30:20,609
is a silicon oxide all metal there is no
third component

518
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:24,339
and adding backs just to throw up
service engineering

519
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:28,299
I don't think anybody which would at
take on that burn and

520
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:32,139
assume that extra cost so so far
microchips

521
00:30:32,139 --> 00:30:36,159
of at the actual for this what is
possible to manufacture

522
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,019
and any other complexity would make
ships you have much larger

523
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:43,349
are much more expensive

524
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,799
using gloves to to something

525
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,530
to beat site re:

526
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:52,770
months I'll I'm

527
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:56,660
so this will be operational measures
separate that that would start somebody

528
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,850
who looks set to chip while it's running

529
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,450
and tries to to see some pilot races for
example but

530
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,470
tweet me a completely breaking to chat
with taking it apart

531
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,600
there's no current going through to chip
while while we investigated

532
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,870
so any any of this type of measure would

533
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:17,430
from to prevent such an of taxol might
smite aimed at preventing sexual attack

534
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,570
we are you

535
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:22,159
doing this really looking at that that
that that I'm

536
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,460
dis the design of the chip not

537
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,850
its functionality while its operating so
we never look at

538
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,760
input and output data for example I'm if
that makes sense

539
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,800
our live thermal

540
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:39,310
right so that the comment is that I'm

541
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,600
he if you want to look at the running
ship to you probably want to look at

542
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,900
them when the king of

543
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:47,020
found yeah that's that we're I'm

544
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,340
changing DS again a little bit and

545
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,490
as as a has amassed added motivation it
here

546
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:56,840
if you haven't yet started thinking
about what shapiro attack

547
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,230
and have of results from from what we
have after less than an hour diff

548
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,110
take to go on but I already mentioned
that there was a lawsuit said it was a

549
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,360
lot of publicity

550
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,570
I'm over over this from both the census
job issue just

551
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,360
and thousands of application essay about
$2 billion of dis

552
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,430
chips deployed now we don't even know
where but

553
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,320
a lot of I'm toe collect when they
called like

554
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,780
unfair collect I'm pain painful process
%uh Metro

555
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,090
but also high security access control to
buildings

556
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,240
payment sometimes thank so

557
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,220
there was a lot of discussion about the
security a bit that before we going to

558
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,870
do weaknesses when he first briefly

559
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:44,180
sketch out what what this ship is and
what it does so it's is a cryptographic

560
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,000
ship and all we really wanted

561
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,470
to a veces the cryptographic cipher
which is a proprietary scifi &

562
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,750
kind of different from everything we've
seen before I'm it consists of a forty a

563
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,530
piddling if you pick shift register

564
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,520
and at filter functions so that the
manufacture fed us to

565
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,160
just I register where everything's
shifting over by

566
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:08,320
by by one position each clock and then
that one empty spot in the beginning

567
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,800
is filled by the Excel sum up this
process it is some random number

568
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,810
generation

569
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:16,629
right generator if you so wish and then
day

570
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,000
that the binary function on top of that
text when the FT's

571
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,400
he spits and generates one bit in each
clock

572
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,970
so will generate a stream of bits one in
each clock

573
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,850
and they can be used as an ex apec so
you wanna send a message she actually

574
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,840
message was that pat send it over

575
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,540
and if somebody can reconstruct the can
can generate an extra pair

576
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:40,220
they said again the coveted message
simple streams I

577
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,310
it's not just useful for they don't rip
Shane

578
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,310
happen this take hell but also for
authentication authentication meaning

579
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,100
you wanna prove to somebody that you
know something secret

580
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:54,090
so that she could well be a 48-bit key
and to prove

581
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,510
to to bed as a party that you know that
the secret key

582
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,450
Hilo to secret key in this surface on
both sides and no

583
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,590
random numbers this apart from both
sides and those

584
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,990
up headed into this register and some
some unfortunately linear fashion

585
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,300
which makes a very valuable and then
also did ID number of this ship is added

586
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,730
and then what comes out is different
every time since a random number so

587
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:17,360
different

588
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,280
we can only be generated knowing to keep
they can prove it you know the key

589
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,500
and simple enough any questions on this

590
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,840
okay need

591
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,070
expect you be 30 comments 48 that he is
in

592
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:38,480
exec a six-year well want

593
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,210
11 could def one could have known that
yes it all but

594
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,290
FB oftentimes I came in is made that as
long as something is

595
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:50,279
a secret nobody can break it hence by
definition must be secured

596
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,370
work exactly does not work that way look
that way

597
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:56,418
3 UT I'm with local

598
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:59,690
locus use to have diffuse

599
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:03,280
yep I love deviantART be no password

600
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,670
few out found the dial-up getting

601
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,770
night and so the bed the partisan the
divine

602
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,400
they become he didn't work for the day
f.3d

603
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,850
yeah thanks thanks for that example of
yet another case right security through

604
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,150
obscurity does not work

605
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,880
and now in this case everybody knew it
was a 4850 key so

606
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,900
everybody knew that on average strain

607
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,860
to 247 cryptographic operation you
should be able to recover that

608
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:37,860
which

609
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,030
me find

610
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,270
security for certain applications is
good enough now at this chick does not

611
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:02,000
provide for the 8-bit security

612
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,090
you do not have to spend 15 minutes on
an expensive computer to break it

613
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:11,269
and when we stop this so many weaknesses

614
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:17,380
and let some was a random number Saudi
to bed random numbers

615
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,709
is what supposedly comes out of the chip
then either 32-bit Noranda

616
00:36:22,709 --> 00:36:26,928
yeah it's a 16-bit number

617
00:36:26,929 --> 00:36:30,159
that is determined by the time that you
asked for it

618
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:35,179
number so it starts off in the same
state as physically counter

619
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:39,279
let its currency could truly and on the
ice before and a number and we'll tell

620
00:36:39,279 --> 00:36:41,149
you that that kind kind estate

621
00:36:41,149 --> 00:36:44,239
and that's the random number same

622
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,749
under me that fact that to you can you
can through asking and the right moment

623
00:36:48,749 --> 00:36:50,269
I know right sequence rather

624
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:54,479
I'm get the same and the number every
time so there's no rain in this in his

625
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:55,229
protocol

626
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:58,229
and that nope indication for the call
was out in the rain in that

627
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:02,349
is total prey to replay attack when he
overheard one

628
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:05,809
when authentication you can just and
said in exact same way

629
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:09,459
and if the same number us where you is
the same output is generated

630
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:13,019
so a vindication completely breaks apart
now

631
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:17,189
save they were going to fix that which
stay have fun to read outside

632
00:37:17,189 --> 00:37:21,629
and some your chips which they will run
it excite what it called the my Fit Plus

633
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,279
Scott

634
00:37:22,279 --> 00:37:26,239
now to my purpose but also as a yes
bankruptcy I'm not gonna talk about that

635
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:26,759
but that

636
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:30,339
and that the weekend trips: descriptor
one algorithm

637
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:34,959
with strong random numbers is still much
more vulnerable than brute force

638
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:38,388
one same that you can do it but you can
always go against the

639
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:42,009
a 48-bit fully seated a sci-fi

640
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,359
and what the GSM tracking projected to
is complete range of having some rather

641
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:50,549
distinguish point a now you still have
to spend on 50 minutes on

642
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,649
on on expensive computer but you do that
only once

643
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:59,679
to break any number of text and you can
break those in about 30 seconds on the

644
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,459
computer no

645
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:05,118
there might be worse for for stealing
bus ticket nobody knows but

646
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,019
it's definitely was for breaking into
building right maybe day

647
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:13,909
the fifteen minutes what already have
been the couple has a taxi can do

648
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:18,309
I'm the protocol is so simple
everything's combine many only

649
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:22,099
so if you ask the right questions
meaning you you send to write random

650
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:22,669
numbers

651
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:25,908
in your disclose itself the secret key

652
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:30,289
one issue at a time and you can you can
basically put for the key and just play

653
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:33,589
sending a couple of random numbers and
and see how it's just funny

654
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:37,409
you can figure out much possible to
secretly approved for things interesting

655
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:38,349
just review

656
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,349
couple of more advanced attacks all

657
00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:45,089
I'm what we call the algebraic attacks
and exploited

658
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,469
this structure of decipher itself so if
you went to fix everything

659
00:38:48,469 --> 00:38:51,869
if you weight increase the secret key I
size

660
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:55,299
if you you if you use good random
numbers if you were to fix the problem

661
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:58,829
call but still use the same basic idea
of having

662
00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:03,039
a simple function like this you can you
can do just how to break it takes a

663
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,459
physical build up of day

664
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:07,979
thea of describing to the whole cipher

665
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:11,999
as a system of equations and then his
Inc off-the-shelf tools

666
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:15,719
that mathematicians used to solve its
system of equations a mini set for

667
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:16,669
example is that

668
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:19,848
is a is a tool use for that and

669
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:23,339
so that the most advanced over break
attacks on this breaks

670
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:27,119
any for the open secret key in 12
seconds on

671
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,209
on a computer right now expensive up
when needed

672
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:33,328
and that's basically that the bottom of
of

673
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:36,719
security minute takes long it even type
the command

674
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,269
them to break to keep to what's that

675
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:47,889
I'll hours hide

676
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,889
right I'm

677
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:54,729
well to conclude

678
00:39:54,729 --> 00:39:58,559
reverse engineering is entirely possible
and you should try

679
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:03,909
if you do let me know and I'll help I'll
help by giving you are tools which will

680
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:04,939
be released sometime

681
00:40:04,939 --> 00:40:10,178
soon anyway I'm how are held by
explaining you VLSI after some

682
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:14,179
something you need and no help getting
around obfuscation

683
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:18,059
where I'm I want to be challenged I
wanna see some of its case have actually

684
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:18,489
makes

685
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:22,109
makes our to us not find anything
anymore what we

686
00:40:22,109 --> 00:40:26,939
we haven't come across any of that yet
and on a cryptographic site we

687
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:30,339
have necessarily like but yet again seen
that

688
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:34,038
obscured as security through obscurity
doesn't help at all and

689
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,999
as a set and the beginning and it hurts
you

690
00:40:37,999 --> 00:40:41,219
beyond not helping it hurts you very
much

691
00:40:41,219 --> 00:40:45,949
since designing a truck drivers and in
the in in some companies make room

692
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:49,799
and trying to keep it secret without
peer review will

693
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:53,059
produce week our prisons almost
guarantee unless you're

694
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:56,569
the NSA probably well was that

695
00:40:56,569 --> 00:41:03,569
on a thank you for your time so you know
we have identified a question go

696
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,280
so the question is it I'm can can you
can can we reverse something that start

697
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,500
in an FPGA

698
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,580
which is which is a shipped FedEx I'm

699
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,240
it's a cross between arm software and
hardware and add

700
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,340
and has it has small how quests else

701
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,350
that are basically programs through
software but that bill

702
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:44,060
a circuit and all in effigy really is

703
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:48,040
is a memory from a programming
standpoint and

704
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,380
fpga-based can be written to but also
read from

705
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,900
some refugees have security feature so
you can lock them

706
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,490
but us Chris from flight logic how to
get around that

707
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,790
so it's it's more a question of software

708
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,980
reverse engineering and we all know that
Southwest Tribune

709
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,320
to reverse engineer using idea pro in
europe those tools

710
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:16,320
min

711
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,430
when applications to AC for reverse
sensing hardware be on security

712
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:25,480
well I think security is to pick up
location since their

713
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,369
its its or its it's clear that a lot of
people haven't yet understood that

714
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:31,650
things should be peer-reviewed

715
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:35,880
as application that I do see though is
I'm law

716
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,970
clearly on on the evil side stealing
somebody's

717
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:42,650
on perfect implementations of some some
tricky problem

718
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:47,690
so graphics and sound examples where
where people put a lot of effort into

719
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,019
making unknown algorithm smaller and
smaller and smaller

720
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:56,299
on my fish into any of that so I'll we
are definitely not the first to to do

721
00:42:56,299 --> 00:42:58,880
this type of reverse engineering we're
just the first two

722
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,390
to try to to get other people to do it
that there's

723
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:06,618
this business is doing that and a and do
it if a lot of money and they they

724
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:08,640
usually heightened patent litigations

725
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,500
save you suspect some other company to
infringe a patent

726
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,650
to the easiest way to prove that is to
reverse engineer to chip in showing that

727
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:17,240
they in fact

728
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:20,440
use your order is a tu dises already
being done

729
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,779
on in and kind of a different world than

730
00:43:23,779 --> 00:43:28,710
academia me he

731
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,049
things

732
00:43:33,049 --> 00:43:40,049
ever come across

733
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:43,269
on your questions haven't come across
little

734
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:47,420
little a name saw

735
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,650
Marcus that the chip design a left and 0

736
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,319
in this said no but in in a couple of
other jobs and I think

737
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:00,829
fly logics what has a couple examples
yup that s

738
00:44:00,829 --> 00:44:04,680
that that this that sometimes designers
even play jokes where than

739
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,490
dead obfuscation layout and says
something and and

740
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:15,490
hacksaw language yeah I'm website see

741
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:22,859
rights or six exactly help

742
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:28,170
service

743
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:32,279
say

744
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:36,650
screen you should not be streak

745
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:43,650
Verena any more questions yeah

746
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,490
to question is that wouldn't wouldn't

747
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,890
had medication open the market for a
scaleable reverse engineering and yes I

748
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:52,900
hope it will if

749
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,079
if somebody wants to take this
commercial while keeping the twins open

750
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:56,829
source I'll

751
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:00,520
all definitely be be willing to support
that

752
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,630
in any way well

753
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,740
because we our system was designed to be
scalable but does

754
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,050
Ted s no reason why somebody was enough

755
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:14,440
patience couldn't couldn't make it scale
about that the idea said that

756
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,280
here's yes yeah it's just our
implementation that isn't yeah it's it's

757
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,000
a bunch of MATLAB scripts

758
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:29,000
yes

759
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,870
how long did it take for us to reverse
this ship well we

760
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:37,540
we were trying different things for over
because have about two years

761
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,620
now if if we given all the tools we have
now

762
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:47,620
wanted to do it again about two weeks

763
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:56,910
yes

764
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,020
do you plan to reverse some houses six
clearly yes

765
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:03,109
and a bottleneck at the moment as is
taking the pictures

766
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:06,990
I don't we ever will with a couple of
people starting on that now get getting

767
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,650
you said a polishing and all that so
yeah we should have an influx of

768
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:17,650
of week algorithms soon and hopefully
good

769
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:25,710
on

770
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,190
to do different the different
manufactures design

771
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,010
I'm differently well they all use the
same routing

772
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,230
tool cadence so the way they place and
route sings

773
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:41,280
as is almost indistinguishable but they
do use different logic cells just for

774
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:41,900
example

775
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:45,550
and does not come from there from the My
Fair its

776
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:49,420
it's another are for the tech and this
is a flip-flop I'm

777
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,440
but they are almost the same so it did

778
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,470
what would you seen text books

779
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,690
as good examples of how to build a
flip-flop how to build a multiplayer

780
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,380
only thing

781
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,020
people use that in practice they say
almost always

782
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,450
exactly the same of the selected

783
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,530
keys which is the military GPS

784
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:16,600
kitchen were resolution see doesn't get
your

785
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,510
Richard yes art

786
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:25,290
they are there's civil and military
versions

787
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,750
received right good

788
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:37,060
up

789
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,340
so the question is whether that the
military GPS to

790
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,600
that done blood GPS on

791
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:49,050
has and has a silicon implementation and
I'm sure does and if anybody gets me

792
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,650
10 copies of that ship we should no
Pedersen

793
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:57,520
my question

794
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:04,520
yes 1

795
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,750
but what's the cause is doing as a tip

796
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,120
well getting to tools from us getting a
microscope

797
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,080
spending probably about two months
trying to figure out all the polishing

798
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,060
and then spending maybe we taking the
pictures and another week running the

799
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:27,560
tools

800
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,880
that's because you have to assume if you
wanted to do

801
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,880
yeah but it is fun at front I get no
more questions

802
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:46,040
of on mafia up

803
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,120
so question is how many how many copies
of it if you need to reverse engineer

804
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,680
something on optimally 1

805
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:58,710
but there's so many things that could go

806
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:02,190
wrong so probably 3 on average

807
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,110
yeah is probably Riverside

808
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:10,780
also trade-off between careful you have
to be

809
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:15,210
if you know your to going to be very
careful

810
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,500
times to versus reports yeah

811
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,200
the point now especially if you if you
some off to a rough

812
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:28,010
faster polishing now just by accident he
he cut

813
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:32,870
Singh said he didn't intend to K

814
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,350
I'm a question thank you very much the
