1
00:00:00,139 --> 00:00:03,998
as you know to lately obviously sampled
and

2
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:07,810
they just kinda laughed because most my
samples are so skewer you know I like to

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,530
do things like a scratchy old

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,030
children's records from thrifts stores
or historical speeches I like to sample

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,670
a

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,080
herbert hoover things like that so um

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,190
it's really a interesting how sampling
technology has changed and and

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,700
working go on now I am so

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,470
unlike a net take up too much more of
your time I'm just gonna say that I

10
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,759
think sampling

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,900
is free publicity I mean I always say
you know where would rip James be

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,269
without MC Hammer

13
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,900
were you know where the Beatles be
without Danger Mouse

14
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:47,100
or a where we cute where would you to be
without negative land probably nowhere

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,100
thank you okay at this point would like
to do is

16
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,910
so we sorta focused one area focused on
one area that sort of sample-based

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,170
and a dealing with culture jamming no 1
I'm

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,560
move into an area %uh that deals with
also

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,270
the technology behind mean if it
manipulation of samples

20
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:14,820
and so and culture jamming and about the
perfect person to

21
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,040
bring into that would be trademarks see
if the evolution Control Committee so

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,590
a we're gonna do a quick switch right
here in terms of the audio

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,770
and saw in terms of the video so

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,310
um one thing I wanted to do is incurs
people to check out these web sites that

25
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,460
we've been talking about

26
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,479

going on that

much for love you for coming out here to

36
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:13,010
hacking community in general and I don't
just say that to be nice

37
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,060
but I actually say that for my personal
personal

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,669
way actually I %um come here to admit to
you that

39
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,840
yes I was a teenage computer hacker in
1980

40
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,180
school yes

41
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:33,609
thank you so %uh I certainly I actually
had I was very active hacker and

42
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:39,079
1982 it age 16 up until when war games
came out and it just became a little bit

43
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:39,739
too

44
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,669
above-ground at us so I kind of shifted
at that point to music and art so I

45
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:50,309
really I i very up a very consciously
like change this sort of hacking it

46
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:54,769
energy from a computer directed packing
energy to an art and music

47
00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:58,719
packing energy and at that point I
launch the evolution Control Committee

48
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,858
so that was a let's see I think we did
our first show 1986

49
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:08,049
and somewhere around 1992 I put it
together

50
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:12,269
Public Enemy check the eaves vocals from
Public Enemy and Herb Alpert and the

51
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:13,639
Tijuana brass

52
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:17,519
which pull together to be the whipped
cream mixes and now I'm

53
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,529
rather proud to say is attributed to
being the first matchup

54
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:25,540
Wow how great is that and %uh so just to
give you a little bit to the rest the

55
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,858
story got a great lie so

56
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,189
video here that tell some other great
stories for history

57
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,078
its few years old now but still pretty
relevant so let me just play it will

58
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,499
test out the audio/video

59

2000 at least

61
00:03:55,329 --> 00:03:58,329

perot

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,409
copyright for the nation yes copyright
violation for the nation's been our

78
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:15,430
slogan since

79
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,569
back when filing copyrights you had to
try to

80
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,699
and so we've been cutting and pasting
our way through

81
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:25,169
a legalities for quite a while and not
only

82
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:30,349
through a legality is so copyright and
with audio but also with hardware and

83
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,770
things like that I

84
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,539
hacking is just a synonym for cutting
and cutting goes with pasting after all

85
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:39,750
and so that by the way it keep a note

86
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,430
cutting and pasting that originates from
cutting and pasting audiotapes

87
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,479
r8 so we cut and paste audio but also
hardware/software

88
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,930
laws ideas and things like that this
thing is called the thimble tryna i've a

89
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,620
little video

90
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,629
here and this thing is so

91
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,779
basically something I made to her

92
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,089
couple times thank you

93
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:09,919
basically I to be able to perform all
this crazy sample base cut and pasted

94
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,938
ridiculousness

95
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:14,300
what do you really used to do that you
know I

96
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,520
turntables here kinda but that's not
really all that

97
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,399
and so I made this thing called the
thimble Tron its 10 ordinary sewing

98
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:24,060
symbols on them my fingertips they're
all wired together

99
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,389
into some custom electronics I packed up
into

100
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:31,319
this computer and basically when I touch
the thimbles together

101
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,990
it'll trigger samples for me

102
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,159
so that way I can actually perform some
of this stuff rather than just us sit

103
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:42,188
behind the laptop and look like I'm
answering my email during a whole show

104
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:45,569
so I i thought i'd give you a little
demo that here

105
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:49,649
by the way the just a note that the
temples a thimble trying and everything

106
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:51,930
is another example the whole cut and
paste the static

107
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,519
because the I mean the temples well you
know stolen from my mom sewing kit

108
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,569
the electronics that hacked up here

109
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,979
a let's see I just added the lights and
those a

110
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,469
the electronics behind those came from a
baby monitor that I tore apart

111
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,569
and so you get the idea there all right
let me just show you a of

112
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,019
I you saw a little bit about that rocked
by rate thing I'll just show you the

113
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:16,709
whole thing here and will play along

181
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,200
the technology aspects is this

182
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,230
now wanna really delve into the
technological aspects in terms of social

183
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,100
political

184
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,370
are interaction and to introduce to you
Ricardo Dominguez

185
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,120
on and he's done some amazing work in
terms of technology and

186
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,460
social issues and so look serb bring him
up and we'll get his laptop hooked up

187
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,040
right now

188
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,410
so up I hope that I'm search

189
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,079
again sir showing you that circumvent
diagram above where

190
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,660
%uh technological exploration and

191
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:44,969
arm packing and are

192
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,050
culture jamming and exploring all those
things or to mix together

193
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,860
to create some really interesting are
pieces of art

194
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,870
and some things to make you think so
here we go

195
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:02,870
here's Ricardo Dominguez all

196
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:11,300
job my son's back they're making
commentary so

197
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,070
I'll try to move ahead as quickly as
possible

198
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,890
yes doctors say hear you arm

199
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,560
up electronics civil disobedience which
is world began

200
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,400
began is something that develop with
critical Art Ensemble in Tallahassee

201
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
Florida in the early eighties

202
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,990
%uh we were not hackers we did not have
computers all we saw what was available

203
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:43,440
in the media whether it was so war games
or trauma or

204
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,080
colossus before been project or the
computer wore tennis shoes or

205
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,370
Neuromancer those were the spaces that

206
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,440
were available to us and so critical Art
Ensemble took

207
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,740
a William Gibson's definition of
cyberspace is a mass consensual

208
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,610
hallucination

209
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,750
to heart and in that book he defines

210
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,570
a situation where hackers a hacker in a
cyborg

211
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,020
are unable to break through a very hard
on Quora informatics

212
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:16,840
and they have to go to another group the
Panther moderns

213
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,020
the Panther modern czar theater group
will create

214
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:25,270
10,000 realities that then enable
hackers and cyborgs to move forth

215
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,360
to break the informatics bunker so we
decided to be

216
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,490
the Panther moderns and the way that we
did this was due to a formal

217
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:38,520
utopian plagiarism which we announced
she added an electronic disturbance or

218
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,090
force

219
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:43,520
first book actually written in the
eighties but published in nineteen

220
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,939
94 I think available online

221
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,190
copyright at and %uh there are we

222
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:55,050
decided to begin to our map out the
future of the nineties

223
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,370
and how we would intervene in

224
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:03,890
doubt emerging future are we divided to
it into three areas of the emerging

225
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,819
capitalism

226
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,710
in the early nineties between 1990 and
1994 Digital capitalism would emerge

227
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,070
our method up intervention would be
electronic civil disobedience

228
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,060
which was a new version love civil
disobedience thats mass

229
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,370
nonviolent action within that
performative matrix

230
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,580
the next a area would be the emergence a
bio capitalism

231
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:30,550
working with act up aids coalition to
unleash power in the eighties

232
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,500
a community research initiatives were
developed in terms of

233
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,890
dealing with a interventions into

234
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,949
the biological core and a course some
love you may know what happened to some

235
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,480
IOC omits particular Steve Kurtz

236
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,610
who is accused of bioterrorism I

237
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,770
%um the 2003 and has won the court case

238
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,010
and then finally would be particle
capitalism the emergence of

239
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,270
nanotechnology

240
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:01,930
from 9 the a 2001 and the area of
intervention there would be no

241
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,110
toxicology so in the early ninety so I
came here to New York City and started

242
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,430
working with the artist will thanks
Taylor

243
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,950
to create thing dotnet and Internet
service provider for

244
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,290
artist and activists I we host

245
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,459
such groups and this was a course before

246
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:24,089
so the web up but later they became
fairly well-known art market

247
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:27,650
ito Lloyd yes mandela tronic disturbance
theater

248
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,880
course now one other questions for

249
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,810
elettronica of civil disobedience what
that we had a theory

250
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,120
that it would be non-violent direct
action online but we didn't have a

251
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,280
practice that is the matrix itself

252
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,589
wasn't really played out and so are
reading the rand corporation papers have

253
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:45,560
the early nineties

254
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,459
run felt in a quella they began to
define cyber war and cybercrime and

255
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,070
cyber terrorism

256
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,530
so I thought I would be a good
theoretical space to then intervene

257
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,670
a difference and that is elec tronic
civil disobedience

258
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,290
which would not work in the same way as
cyberspace

259
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:07,020
I in terms of cyberterrorism cybercrime
and cyber war

260
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,079
that is that electronic civil
disobedience would work on this mass

261
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,980
consensual hallucination

262
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,189
paradigm I and shift the semantic core

263
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:20,070
up the language so that was prepared but
we really did not have the

264
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:25,819
a fullness a vision are to develop the
idea and told 1994

265
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,470
and I'm going to do or really bad
keynote about I put up by

266
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,700
the rum as I was on a plane

267
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,360
I red-eye this morning arm

268
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,080
and I was in 1994 one minute after
midnight that this up at the Spurs

269
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,169
emerged at the same time is now after
the free trade zone

270
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,590
the first act 0 neoliberalism in
practice

271
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:51,678
%ah the digital stuff but the Spurs
emerged exactly at that same time

272
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,900
the stuff but the Spurs a ripped into
the electronic fabric

273
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,530
unbeknownst to themselves and to others
an impossibility

274
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,129
occurred a consensual hallucination even
to this day

275
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,640
whenever i speak at naval intelligence
or the NSA or any of those places

276
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,770
they consistently always ask out that
date do it

277
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:13,629
while we don't know I always say it's my
and technology

278
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,060
but it is not the speed of technology or
the speed of power that this up at the

279
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,580
stars Brock but this speed

280
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,409
up dreams that is that they spoke from
the future

281
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,160
and so they enabled us to begin to think
about how to put

282
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,400
electronic this civil disobedience from
theory into practice

283
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:36,580
and %uh they came up here um sometime
around 1995

284
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,350
not us up at the stars but as every day
are all

285
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,870
what we would call a wet mines instead
of what backs

286
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,530
and at these white mine spoke to us that
the thing at Chelsea

287
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,810
and they like the idea of electronic
civil disobedience and they said

288
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,970
we will tell you when you should
launcher so we sat around waiting

289
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,000
and thinking meanwhile the anonymous
digital coalition and Italy

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,240
began to do their first net strikes our
first against the

291
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,429
the French for nuclear testing in the
pacific and then I began to think about

292
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,350
doing work with us up at the specific

293
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,090
as well in 1995 so it's the anonymous
federal court all coalition

294
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,840
Italy that really began some be early
practice

295
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,659
but what happened was that I in 1997
December 22nd

296
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,480
the OCT al massacre happened in cheopas
forty five women and children were

297
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,750
killed

298
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,080
we felt as the digital stuff but the
Spurs that this was the time

299
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,909
indeed the support the state said now
it's time to launch electronic civil

300
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,000
disobedience

301
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,660
so it is now ten years arson suppressed
all bombing common Carrasso

302
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,240
up the electronic disturbance theater
along with Stephan reign myself

303
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,300
created the automated tool this up at
the stuff like that

304
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,370
we just celebrated as I said this last
april 10 years

305
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,480
we launched at I'll about 10,000 people

306
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,000
arm participated in the action one other
things was that we didn't

307
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,440
were quite clear as to what the
anonymous digital coalition

308
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,990
was originally doing with the not strike

309
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,390
and they were recommending that we used
the reload refresh button

310
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,640
over and over say between one and three
o'clock against the Mexican President

311
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,510
website

312
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:17,840
and what Bratz doll bombing Carmen
carafe success is why should we heard

313
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,250
our little fingers

314
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,360
why don't we just create a simple script
that will take into account how many

315
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,060
people

316
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,428
join and it will hit the refresh reload
button for us

317
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,650
so about ten thousand people joined I we
did a virtual sedan against the

318
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,990
president's website

319
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:36,679
are people around the planet
participated and the president's website

320
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:40,090
responded so many people are requesting
this page that you'll have to come back

321
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,408
later

322
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:45,720
the other thing that we did is a
traditional tactical joke a of the 404

323
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,570
file

324
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,220
that is I of course you guys know that
if you put some information and

325
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,270
and it comes up this information for a
for is not found on this server

326
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,730
what we did is we took at the Jodi .org
joke or daughters joke about

327
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,060
and Winstead we started uploading into
the Mexican web so over

328
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,879
about does justice exist on this server
in the server would respond

329
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:09,710
justice does not exist on this
government Mexican government web server

330
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,600
does justice democracy so doing in
material just here at the same time that

331
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,560
we were doing

332
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,340
a material gesture we were on the front
page of the New York Times the next day

333
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,530
they said hacktivists were here we
didn't like the word

334
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,980
a hacktivist because we didn't feel we
were truly hackers

335
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,870
we said we were lower than script
kiddies really I am

336
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,780
and it's always an honor to be called a
hacktivist but we didn't feel that was

337
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,740
the right term it was electronic civil
disobedience

338
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,240
moving the paradigm up the network from
communication and documentation

339
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,050
21 non-violent direct action online the
largest event that we did was on now

340
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,520
september ninth

341
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,610
I 1998 at Ars Electronica it was called
swarm

342
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,750
we did in action against the pentagon
who was selling of militaria

343
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,710
a hardware to the Mexican army to use
against the stuff but the Spurs

344
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:05,230
Frankfurt Stock Exchange you wanted to
mine up by uranium rights

345
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,550
in cheopas and other Mexican President

346
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:12,790
as always %uh it was there that we had
an encounter with our first I

347
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,310
hackers heart and they said ette is pure

348
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,350
evil are which is better than being

349
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:25,000
impure evil I think I and we said well
we want to learn from hackers but we're

350
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,890
gonna do this action on the lesson we
shall be

351
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:33,500
pure evolved arm the pentagon attacked
us they did the first information war

352
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,710
a weapon at us we don't even know what
that was probably some sort of

353
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,940
JavaScript or something of the sort

354
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,940
but the next day arm we were

355
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,720
on the in the newspaper again front-page
New York Times

356
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,900
I love a few weeks later and the US
Department and Department of Defense

357
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:51,550
Department New York Times

358
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,960
said if the electronic disturbance there
was any legal it was certainly

359
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
immoral I like the quality of in
morality

360
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,880
in terms of are activism I always say we
are not digitally correct

361
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,860
I hacktivists we are digitally incorrect
activists

362
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,150
arm the battle yes okay so

363
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,919
all move forward I wanna be outcomes I
love this

364
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,830
was that we work with the the law legal
departments and lawyers to across the

365
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,850
the global and wanna borrow a major
outcomes was that we did a

366
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,010
deportation class action against
Lufthansa with

367
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:31,250
part of Chaos Computer Club no borders
community

368
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,320
and %uh several of street protests group

369
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,020
it worked extremely well but about a
year later the secret service so

370
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:43,520
Germany came and took all the server so
that where you stand accused them of

371
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,850
cyberterrorism

372
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:48,220
the lower court I decided that it was
cyberterrorism

373
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,400
but with our legal counsel and and
groups

374
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,030
we pushed through that it was electronic
civil disobedience it should be treated

375
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,730
as civil disobedience

376
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:59,780
that is you get put in jail only for 24
hours

377
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,639
I then went up to the higher Regional
Court as you can see it was overruled in

378
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,890
the initial verdict

379
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,429
the higher court found that the online
demonstration did not constitute

380
00:24:08,429 --> 00:24:12,030
a show of force but was intended to
influence public opinion

381
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,710
and this is predominately the way here
in the US and around the world

382
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,929
elektronik civil disobedience is being
used

383
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,490
I'll finish air are my current workers
at Cal it. to you

384
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,600
it's a research lab are we doing border
disturbance technology

385
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,770
we're focusing in on immigrant the
transporter trolls

386
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,190
that is we hacked into the GPS have cell
phones in order to update the cell

387
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,640
phones and give them to people crossing
the border

388
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,560
so they know exactly where they are and
they were also investigating

389
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,570
areas have 90 toxicology thank you very
much

390
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,490
okay I would like to love encourage
people we've run out of time

391
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:52,820
and I hope I hope that we've sorted
shown you

392
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,090
a the seeds have some really amazing
things that can be done

393
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,610
with technology in terms of hacking
activism culture jamming

394
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,070
et cetera we're gonna move to the back
area and

395
