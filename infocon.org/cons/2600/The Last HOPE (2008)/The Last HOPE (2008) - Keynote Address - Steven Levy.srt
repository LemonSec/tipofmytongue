I've never actually really done before

29
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,989
processo up how I wrote this book

30

call hackers I'll as was mentioned in

31
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,090
I hope someday you know about it I
divider a book called hackers

32
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,180
it was not the source material for the
movie starring

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,780
Angelina Jolie which was a circumstance
which was bad for my bank account but

34
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,799
puts my dignity

35
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:34,609
I but up you know that I think I

36
00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:38,340
by reading a book had something to do
with my are speaking here today

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,790
I wanna share some some things about a
how I Road written

38
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,548
what happened to the word hacker sense
and the you know to take a little look

39
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:46,870
at

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,480
where I was right where was wrong and
also I'm going to have something special

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,310
so a little

42
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,470
try to figure out after I talk before I
take questions I don't take questions

43
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,230
to run a little contest like went to my
private stash

44
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:04,828
and I have here a pretty pristine
versions of the hardback

45
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:08,019
copy of hackers which I'd like to give
to some

46
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:11,989
up person certainly person would
consider inner self lucky to get

47
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,889
so um trying to figure out a way to run
I real would pay muscle contests worst

48
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:17,560
someone get

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,660
this book to take home their so

50
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,760
how tonight come to write

51
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,209
that book put that changed my life and

52
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:31,459
you know amazingly has changed the life

53
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:35,790
some people read it according to what
they tell me so

54
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,120
let's go back to time long ago

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
I will try to hide my HR this is around
the time

56
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,620
there ronald reagan was taking the oath
of office and mastodons roaming the

57
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,060
earth

58
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,439
I was a freelance writer

59
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,659
I was reading general subjects which was

60
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,290
what happens when you become an English
major I wrote about sports and

61
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,219
up music and murders and and things like
that I interviewed Bruce Springsteen

62
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,939
Bob Marley and doctor J one little
digression

63
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,709
if you allow me it's because I just
can't believe I do this

64
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,709
interviewing Bob Marley taxes 10 more
amazing things

65
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,010
I did I was reading an article believe
it or not for the philadelphia inquirer

66
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,238
Sunday magazine

67
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,849
about reggae to explain reggae to the
good people in suburban Philadelphia and

68
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,780
others a guy in my food co-op I was
living in the Germantown section

69
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,760
Philadelphia

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,690
who insist that he knew Bob Marley right
is all I know popping up up

71
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,520
and i'd give you an interview no problem
and yeah sure sure

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,780
and when they say take bob's his
mother's house in wilmington delaware

73
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,210
and I'll talk to you and I've got my

74
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:48,440
Volkswagen drove down there with but
semi on

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,090
my host and believe you're not there was
Bob Marley sitting there

76
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,539
and I was found one doing questions that
one so methodical then but now

77
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:00,180
a that's where do things that sometimes
the stupidest question

78
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,099
will get the very best answer so if
you're willing to make yourself

79
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:08,210
the survey idiot doing the interviewing
process take a pic to pay off big time

80
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,930
so I asked Bob Marley up me at that
despite a real

81
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,430
imposter prove it you know I was a good
guy I said really what

82
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,820
for the readers the filth inquiring what
what is reggae

83
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,200
really am incentive just possibly of

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,320
just kinda got ok why sit near his moms
living room without a shirt on

85
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,250
dark as you know and a quiet

86
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,180
before the hurricane comes thats reggae

87
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,369
pretty good

88
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:42,949
so one day I got this assignment to
write

89
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,960
about these people call hackers

90
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,748
and this is about 1981 i'd never touched
the computer before

91
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:55,159
and didn't know much about them around
the time that the controversy

92
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,550
among writers whether we should get
these things with electronic typewriters

93
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,409
right which can remember one-liner what
we did

94
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:05,498
a and yet a lot of people fought me up
what you really wouldn't what qualities

95
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:09,509
ugly things screen on your desk %uh its
kinda lunatic up

96
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,789
but I thought you this is because the
Covenant just the idea

97
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,830
I look into it I i check out the
literature and

98
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,580
there wasn't very much about people call
hackers I'll

99
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:23,688
if if there was you know pretty much the
definition would be

100
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:29,189
a hacker antisocial nerd by and large a
loser who was addicted to computers

101
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:32,639
may be dangerous the mailing a booger
stain curiosity

102
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,249
okay I feel like I could do this clears

103
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:41,149
are you proud of batteries does reduce
the

104
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:44,279
of well II

105
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,419
please let me know so I won't sit in
your chair afterwards

106
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,549
yeah

107
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,529
okay up so II look for stuff about
hackers

108
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:58,509
and I i found the an article in
Psychology Today is a cover story

109
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,110
was called the hacker papers and had a
picture have some really creepy looking

110
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,969
guy on

111
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:06,769
on the cover the article I actually was
over edited

112
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:12,459
a universalism a dialogue that are going
on a at Stanford University edited by

113
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,029
this %uh cycles professor

114
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:18,709
thing Philip Zimbardo well actually II I
met relatively recently any

115
00:07:18,709 --> 00:07:22,509
it was really interesting stuff in Abu
graven psychology evil

116
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,909
but back then he was at Stanford doing
these things are hackers

117
00:07:25,909 --> 00:07:29,580
and hero arm at this is take on the
paper

118
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,508
fascination with the computer becomes an
addiction and as with most

119
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,189
social objections the substance the gets
abused is human relationships

120
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,449
and this was seconded in a book

121
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,459
with one of the few passages about
packing bit that that I could find this

122
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,569
book was written by

123
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:50,769
a MIT professor named Joseph wise Obama
now he's best known for writing a

124
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:51,979
program elisa

125
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:56,550
where a it is like a psychiatrist
session you type in something

126
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,269
and the computer flex pack your question
at showing it and it seems like up

127
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:05,009
to a session with a psychologist there
but he also wrote a book called

128
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,159
computer power Hugh summer human reason
they had very

129
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,110
one distinctive passage became certain
Victoria said I might say

130
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,839
it was not very flattering when we do
that bright young man at the show

131
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,550
appearance of a sunken glowing eyes

132
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,719
to be seen sitting at computer consoles
their arms tense than willing to fire

133
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:24,539
their fingers

134
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,709
already poised to strike as a button in
San keys

135
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,069
on which our attention seems to be
riveted Pacific gamblers on the rolling

136
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:31,699
dice

137
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,669
when %uh so transfixed they often sit a
table strewn with computer printouts

138
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,468
over which they pour like possess
students a couple stick tacks

139
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:42,849
they work until they nearly dropped
twenty thirty hours at a time

140
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:45,889
their food if the arranger is brought to
them

141
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:48,910
coffee cokes sandwiches if possible

142
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,370
they sleep on cots near the printouts
their rapport closer on washing unshaven

143
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:53,990
face is

144
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,959
and they're on con here all testified
they are oblivious to their bodies

145
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,730
and to the world in which they move
those fees or computer bombs

146
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:07,589
compulsive programmers well as a
straight outta dostoevsky right

147
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,750
you can get a more gloomier more to
track

148
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,600
the pressing for people you know if
Angelina Jolie it seem that she would

149
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,819
want to portray a hacker to Bollywood
topped one

150
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:23,819
so I figured okay

151
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,350
cool I'll I'll do the story I'll write
about these weirdos and I'll go to

152
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,410
Stanford because

153
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,300
as the place that was in the Psychology
Today but before I left I

154
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,130
tapped a former colleague who've been
writing about technology a little

155
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,720
and asked him to give me a list of
sources on my talk to welfare

156
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,149
any person to me with was that some key
people in the burgeoning

157
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,540
PC industry there some other people love
you know involved in some interesting

158
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,319
computer stuff

159
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:52,059
so I got on a plane fly out to
california only been there once

160
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,480
my life before dinner call stripper a
road trip there

161
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,290
and I have than anything about computers
they let me tell you

162
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,480
and a got off the plane within four
hours

163
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,019
I was in a hot tub with this guy

164
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,709
jim warren who found the computer fair
well with a couple people live in his

165
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:10,579
property

166
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:14,470
or editing a magazine for em about a
beaming

167
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,610
data on radio site bans and I was
learning about how computers

168
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,350
a power empower people and yet we're
actually excited

169
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,670
and this is a good of town which set for
the entire trip

170
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,610
I went to Stanford I talk to other
people PC industry and entrepreneurs and

171
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:33,980
a 30 engineers and other people doing
interesting stuff

172
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,189
and I was totally blown away by what I
found

173
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:41,089
these were not antisocial nerves but
adventurers

174
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,990
my unit and the thought processes to me
well early fascinate

175
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,459
and what's more they were on to
something I talking to them I realize

176
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,510
that the things they were doing where
things that

177
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,730
all of us we're going to be doing
everything was going to be doing I

178
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,100
in in in not too long and year

179
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,559
this was a world that I had seen like a
really excited about it

180
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,569
and wrote my story and wanted just
continue writing reading more more about

181
00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:10,670
I also as soon as I got home said to my
girlfriend is no I white

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,349
week we've just got to get these things
we both bought Uppal two's

183
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:17,600
at the time they cost tougher to Uppal
to use

184
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640
I am one printer which we share we spent

185
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
ninety five hundred dollars

186
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,790
yeah and a it was worth a

187
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,699
and and and ice are writing about it was
kinda funny

188
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,519
back in again not too many people who
were

189
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,370
tech toys I computers and I'm everybody
here after we got the computers

190
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,929
a one a popular public computing
magazine where the magazine's a other

191
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:45,500
time

192
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,939
right up about this story a women and
and computing

193
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,079
and they had a full page picture my wife

194
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,589
not because she was any think
technically proficient you really didn't

195
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,980
when they've a programmer things like
that she simply use the computer

196
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,260
wow a woman using computer imagine that

197
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,490
it will be like now someone doing an
article women and pencils

198
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,740
right user

199
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,010
so around that time publisher asked me
if I was interested in writing a book

200
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,429
about

201
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:17,399
hackers a things up in writing but more
and here I thought well gee

202
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,809
this is kinda good idea I I'd want to
read a book for a while I had a proposal

203
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:21,929
circulating

204
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:25,750
a believer not to write a book about
cheesing night club singers

205
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,920
that wasn't catching on so I thought you
hackers great I'll do that

206
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,069
and I thought is my first book I was a
little nervous you how we're going to

207
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,679
get this done as much longer than
anything I've ever done

208
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,589
well maybe break chapter of this kind a
hacker and maybe a chapter about that

209
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,439
out scurry chapter after chapter and so
finally I had a a box with the stuff

210
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:44,660
it'll put it up

211
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,699
about me my book about hackers the my
editor gunning James Rhames

212
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:53,260
a he added he was really great he said
to me listen

213
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,260
I i want you to think big be ambitious
and Tim O'Reilly

214
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,939
a who runs through camps and a Riley
publishing

215
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:05,630
has a say that you should always try big
hairy audacious goals

216
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,089
and of course I'd know tomorrow I'll you
then arm and maybe wasn't saying up then

217
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,179
but thats decisive my editor told The

218
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:16,730
to try to do and I think let me try to
do this like 04

219
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,769
why not now's the time so I decided
instead of just kinda piling chapter by

220
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:21,480
chapter

221
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,079
I would try to rate this thing like an
hour it would be an epic story

222
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,360
about how these rebels change the world

223
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,669
and that's all I got the idea hackers
heroes of the computer revolution

224
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:37,019
so I venture of doing this with the

225
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,380
serve a miserable little advance of mine
is below up

226
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,660
contract there and I eventually thought
well I guess will be two pieces to this

227
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,779
book

228
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:48,829
the first will be I the Homebrew
Computer Club

229
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,339
the people who gathered in March 1975

230
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:55,250
after they heard about the Altair
computer the first personal computer

231
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,519
being

232
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,120
release the course that kit yet put
together yourself and from this little

233
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,850
group that met the garage

234
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,579
are all these companies sprang including
Apple computers steve wozniak

235
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,779
went to the Homebrew Computer Club in to
oppresses friends

236
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:13,040
he built the Apple one year and never
showed it to them as first

237
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,939
really are four-color computer and he
met Steve Jobs they made the opportune

238
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:21,329
and that's history but there was a just
moderates things happening there

239
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,459
and I saw how those hardware hackers in
the nineteen seventies

240
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:27,709
really created a the personal computer
revolution and then I want to do

241
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:28,920
something a real time

242
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,709
and i'd been hanging out with these
people in the game hacking world

243
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:35,709
I thought I would hang out this company
and near the

244
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:39,389
up sierras near Yosemite are called

245
00:14:39,389 --> 00:14:43,309
a sierra on-line for school California
and they allowed me

246
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,910
total access the companies like to hang
out and talk about people

247
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,569
who actually learned attack on personal
computers thing again

248
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:53,990
it was interesting because money for the
first time was coming to the equation

249
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,100
so what do these two pieces and that
would be my cock

250
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,860
but as I went on and talk to people I
realized

251
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,269
that actually there was a third part of
an earlier part

252
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:11,059
because all roads seem to leave to what
happened in the late 50's early 60's

253
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:14,910
and one place specifically which was I
might say and as I talk to other people

254
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,649
I realize

255
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,709
know if actually feels like agriculture

256
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:23,420
began their MI today so I really at a
third section so I talk and that will be

257
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,629
the lead section

258
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:28,240
the opening section and when I did that
was called true hackers

259
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,370
and which I wrote about and might say in
the late fifties

260
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:35,790
an early sixties and to me it turned up
my favorite part of the book

261
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,498
and the part which really resonates to
this day

262
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:43,019
and have you know it it was just
thrilling

263
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:46,149
be able to talk to these people know
journalist ever gone near the before

264
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,009
and to tell their story there so

265
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,079
even before I did that I you know of
course I met a lot interesting people

266
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,119
are doing the course a interviewing
there steve wozniak of course

267
00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:00,269
was great you're super generous with his
time and

268
00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:03,749
you're really share with me what goes on
inside a hacker's head

269
00:16:03,749 --> 00:16:06,930
I didn't talk to Steve Jobs during the
course of doing hackers

270
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,059
I'll ready for tennis the book a

271
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:13,660
the Macintosh was about to come out I
think an assignment for rolling stone

272
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,829
to write about the Mac a which hadn't
come out yet. I got

273
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:21,920
Apple to let me end a a couple months
before they they release that

274
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,730
and that's why I first met Steve it was
kinda interesting because

275
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:28,730
I'll I it was the end of the day they
just again

276
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,180
blew my mind it was sorta came to the
first day a I was researching hackers

277
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,470
I met all these amazing people score
source amazing computer

278
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,069
the people I met that day people i
can't. Herzfeld de la cancion

279
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:43,199
Susan kare the Macintosh order sir my
friends to this day

280
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,249
of course the computer I met that day as
my computer to this day so it

281
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:49,869
it was a big deal for me the end of the
day I suppose to meet Steve Jobs we're

282
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:51,360
gonna go out to dinner there

283
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,069
and I heard a lot about it I thought
what is this guy really like

284
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,209
so you know we meet out the lobby at
this though

285
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:01,629
family three the building what they did
to Macintosh and immediately

286
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,309
he launches into this tirade excised in
the story for Rolling Stones

287
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:08,990
now just an airplane I was really a copy
a rolling stone

288
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,118
arse cover story but MTV and it was
awful

289
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,958
and stored procedures trashing the story
left and right using horrible

290
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,179
analogies to body functions gross body
functions the talk about the story

291
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,069
and kept talking talking I wondered when
is he going to take a breath so I could

292
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,800
tell them that I

293
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,959
wrote that story

294
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:30,970
and I finally did he a just gonna just
change the subject and

295
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:35,510
West when talking a great interview you
know and Steve it is not

296
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:39,369
a really a hacker is more but artist
mentality

297
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:43,189
you would never have a hacker whose
obsession is to have fewer and fewer and

298
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,899
fewer buttons on a device

299
00:17:44,899 --> 00:17:48,700
which is sort of Steve's goal you know
the iPhone he's got it down to one

300
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,010
button and eventually it's just going to
be no buttons working again

301
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,450
there's going to be a SodaHead mail
through with but the device whatever it

302
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,169
is

303
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,070
but but it is pretty cool I guess the be
a hacker to try to implement those ideas

304
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,399
to pick one button on their

305
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:05,639
so he certainly deserves to be in this
discussion I also met Bill Gates

306
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:08,830
when I was researching hackers and I'll

307
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,710
I set up an interview with him it was
around 1983 if he was about 12 years all

308
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:13,520
the time

309
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
and I had my first what which are people
like many

310
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,990
interviews with with Bill Gates I think
okay it's really is

311
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,080
a hacker he really has a total hackers
mentality

312
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,770
and for many years after he founded
Microsoft

313
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,429
he would look a project and just go you
know really proclivities

314
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:34,540
I caught up in a weekend when you want
to give me that in

315
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,480
yeah think it was he really could cause
that up in a week and it was really good

316
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,110
at it

317
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:42,200
yes there any coding and in quite a long
time up but still

318
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,290
Tuesday when he talks about business you
know

319
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,668
you know I'll talk about about it what
about the Microsoft

320
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,899
and and other things we talk about some
technical issue not just light up and

321
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,030
and go wild maybe tell you if you
venture

322
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,700
think that's the stupidest thing I ever
a which is the a big expressionism

323
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,960
once we r actually I'm never a
conversation about

324
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,809
are anti-trust doing a very tender time
in Microsoft's history and he threw a

325
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:08,399
pencil a

326
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:12,619
he was a here reset livid

327
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,840
I am I'll and but now it's funny

328
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,908
can't it later years he couldn't say
that's the stupidest thing I've ever

329
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:19,720
heard

330
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,080
a you to an expletive somewhere in that
sense

331
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,629
usually because people just aren't
laughing when he said it was a such a

332
00:19:26,629 --> 00:19:30,679
a self-powered so anyway

333
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:33,770
I got to MIT and I found something

334
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,330
really interesting which was these early
hackers is what the true pioneers

335
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,949
a packing have the this the same way of
looking at things

336
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,030
those hardware hackers and another one
step

337
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:49,830
arm and it was really remarkable vocal
but what I found I think I found

338
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,199
throughout the Rift Valley of computer
culture there

339
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,210
and I can't say I've been downstairs
looked around

340
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,290
that the culture which we have in this
room

341
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:03,100
downstairs the boots the other sessions
the you have here

342
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,050
just would not have existed had it not
been for MIT

343
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,690
that's where things really got cut start
there and specifically it started

344
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,869
strangely enough in this building called
building 2008

345
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:17,490
structure was put up are doing World War
two was meant to be a temporary

346
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,470
structure

347
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,429
was knocked down till nineteen 98 and
was replaced by this

348
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,409
really complicated Frank Carey you know
giant building which is falling apart

349
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:27,429
now incidentally

350
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:30,970
arm and I almost coalescing one is
building 20

351
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,720
but if you venture back in the late 50s
the building 20 you go to all sorts of

352
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,419
things or

353
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:38,850
weld nuclear reactors another kinda
strange things there you would stumble

354
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:39,639
upon

355
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,730
a room with a model railroad layout you
think that this is of this was the

356
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,149
tech Model Railroad Club a might save a
copy to Merck

357
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,760
I don't talk about the big elaborate
train layout

358
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,090
with the Painted Hills and little
conductor figures

359
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:59,059
little Peter mustaches on them and the
oval trains going on there

360
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:02,200
beautifully painted they'll be on top
whale

361
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,580
and underneath the layout that is really
complicated tangle

362
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,790
have switches and year a diodes and all
kinda strange stuff

363
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,850
and that was called duck the system and
the people under

364
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:17,780
work underneath it all the time where
the S&P group of the Model Railroad Club

365
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,369
signals and processing

366
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:24,240
and they were really effective the first
Packers there and that thing

367
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,889
like a intricate computer system and
they actually referred to it

368
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:31,240
as hack in that system which is %uh the
first thing

369
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,799
I found the people using that term for
that kind of thing

370
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,500
now at MIT they had this term called
pack which is like a pract

371
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,629
when your cover the Big Dome there's on
Massachusetts Avenue

372
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:45,100
with aluminum foil are they said oh
that's a great hackett

373
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:49,190
and I think was partly that partly the
way a call for use the term hackers

374
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,720
hacking away at something

375
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,780
a you can in terms that may be in on the
follicle but

376
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,908
you know for persistent and sometimes a
clever way of doing things they think

377
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:58,970
you step

378
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,210
and I i actually came across over the
newsletters

379
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,320
the tech Model Railroad Club they would
sing psalms

380
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,158
hack and give them to me actually read
one a poem that this guy Peter Sampson

381
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,970
who is a a key figure in the we are a
club in early computing

382
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,350
a wrote of its whatever the spirit of
Walt Whitman

383
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,580
switch thrower for the world fuse tester
maker Arutz

384
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,168
player with railroads in the system's
advanced chopper grungy

385
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:30,530
hairy sprawling machine appoint
functional I know like

386
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:34,379
they tell me you are wicked I believe
them fright seen your pain at like balls

387
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:35,480
onto the loose sight

388
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,679
during the system coolies onto the tower
dust all over the place

389
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,909
packing with bifurcated Springs hackett

390
00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:47,089
even as ignored freshman axe was never
lost occupancy has dropped out

391
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:50,290
hacking the AM boards for under its
locks for the switches

392
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,030
and under its control the advance around
the layout package

393
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:58,859
packing the grungy airing sprawling
execute on cable's trying diodes

394
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:02,240
proud to be switched over juice maker
maker of roots

395
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,329
player with railroads and advanced
shopper to the system

396
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:12,710
well in the spring of 1959 these people
who worked on this virtual computer

397
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,909
underneath the layout for the Model
Railroad Club

398
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:18,929
actually got to use a real computer

399
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:23,000
a MIT moved on this interactive computer
that was sort of a

400
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,200
given by the Defense Department poverty
x0

401
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,679
to a you know the mile relative to going
the extra mile River Club

402
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:34,179
no wonder system software for make up
the user previously the only

403
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,339
access to computers they had summer
taking a course the first computer

404
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:38,109
course

405
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:42,300
and I might say a it was a operated by
John McCarthy

406
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:46,669
and there was very frustrating because
back then they have get paper cards to

407
00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:50,399
a the other priests around a computer it
away for days the real quick

408
00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,480
but this was interactive and they went
crazy they

409
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,159
built all the system software I also did
things that you weren't supposed to do

410
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:00,740
on a computer things that don't have
thought of doing like one of them wrote

411
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,609
a program called expensive typewriter

412
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,490
we started the first word processing
program that you could process things

413
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,760
another wanted to a spreadsheet like
math program hand in his homework using

414
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,099
it

415
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,168
and a teacher gave them 0 saying this is
the key you can't do this on a computer

416
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,609
i'm objecting to so

417
00:24:18,609 --> 00:24:22,149
what's more the things they did on the
TX 0

418
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:25,280
they share they believe that every line
of code

419
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,349
should be visible to everyone else they
had no concept

420
00:24:28,349 --> 00:24:32,560
I love intellectual property a or
proprietary information

421
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:39,560
says they were so desperate to find out
how to do things

422
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,360
there were some just with the final how
to do things did

423
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,460
get that they felt that it was it would
be cruel and unusual punishment to deny

424
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,940
someone the access to do this

425
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,300
so they were the programs of paper takes
that put the paper takes in a drawer by

426
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,920
the computer

427
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,060
anyone to pick up the paper tape look at
the code

428
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,360
improve it there put the thing back
there there was an idea

429
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,870
up who owned a program was a ridiculous
concept to begin

430
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:09,450
am as I talked and heard about this and
I realize that that same impulse was

431
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,610
present really

432
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:13,710
and the Homebrew Computer Club and never
even

433
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,290
among a lot of people who are talking it
up a rainy isley and ice or try to

434
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,149
codify that

435
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,460
I called out that the hacker ethic knows
a lot of reports to the hacker ethic

436
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,520
1 a.m. siècle the hands on part

437
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,730
like other hackers juicer desperate to
get their hands on things when they see

438
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,850
something wrong with the world

439
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:33,030
they have to strive to fix it fix it fix
it and

440
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:36,190
even if there's a sign saying don't
touch that

441
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,210
isn't quite support as fix it fix it fix
it so the hands-on comparative really

442
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,860
works there

443
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,150
and also are things in there like saying
you can create or

444
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,610
beauty on a computer work computers can
change your life for the better

445
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,150
and now was his cock want to say that
back then people really im

446
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,660
think about those things before the
computers were something is reserved for

447
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,890
the impersonal and had nothing to do
with or

448
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:00,800
her purity your improving your life
maybe near I when I with the college we

449
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,610
ate a computer's

450
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,170
it Michael work because he thought they
made you into a number a

451
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,400
but these hackers had a different idea
but the most important part

452
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,050
most important precept I love the hacker
ethic today

453
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:15,440
was one that I said it all information
should be free

454
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,820
now it was I'm ugly talking about the
idea of you shouldn't charge workers

455
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,129
back on the concept the computers

456
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,880
no software is a commodity wasn't even
around but

457
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,970
incense as I talked about in sharing
code in

458
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,870
you know when later a the new company
Digital Equipment Corporation

459
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,480
put their new computer pt1 a.m. the same
room with 60 was

460
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,580
a face order to use the same principle
the paper tapes

461
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:46,490
and i actually hacked by collaboration
the first computer game space for

462
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,910
and nigga and built it up that way it
was and in that sense and that's why

463
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:55,370
are there's a preceptor the hacker ethic
called a mistrust authority promote the

464
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,220
centralization

465
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,310
yours because bureaucracies separate you

466
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,850
from information there about forming of
information

467
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:07,130
and and codifying it and you're keeping
you away from it and that's why hackers

468
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,660
8 authority because authorities

469
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,750
keeps them away from information so

470
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:16,210
yeah I i felt that I guess maybe my a
key contribution the book really is

471
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,600
to try to codify that and European and
it really came out

472
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,230
in every single way the you look at that
culture and I might say

473
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,060
I was downstairs a few minutes ago I saw
that up you're pretty big contention

474
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,379
a flock hacking group and locking really
got its start I think a at MIT there

475
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,540
you know because just as hackers hated
locks on computers

476
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,360
I love you know they had a physical
looks like thought you should be able to

477
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,500
get information everywhere

478
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,050
so there was constant work going on
between administrators want to keep

479
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,030
things locked up

480
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,080
and the hackers were to open things up
hiker

481
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,270
named David silver kinda laid out for me
and arm

482
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,870
%um the celestino revista great passage
there were

483
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,510
he talks about it was are also highly
clover warfare

484
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,660
there were administrators well
high-security locks and have faults with

485
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,670
a restore the keys

486
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:05,080
and apps I L course issue keys and they
felt secure

487
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,080
but they were locking everything up the
controlling things and preventing

488
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,899
information from flowing the wrong way

489
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,160
and things from being stolen and there
was another side of the world

490
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,230
where people felt that everything should
be available to everyone and he's

491
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,920
hawkers at pounds and pounds and pounds

492
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,880
keys weekend every conceivable place the
people who did this were very ethical

493
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,770
one of us

494
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,590
they were using his this power steel
were injured it was kinda game

495
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:30,380
partly out of necessity importantly
other key going fun at the also a fight

496
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,730
if it

497
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,430
if you are the right inside circle you
can get the combination to any safe

498
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:38,940
and you get access to anything this is
really true I mean at one point the

499
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,560
administrators got so frustrated

500
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:44,240
that they took this class to safe which
is qualified to

501
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,260
hold government class white material
make so what now

502
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:51,920
we're protected their but of course the
hackers up found one

503
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,290
in a junk yard dog in talking to a few
miles away took apart the settling torch

504
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,240
learn how it works

505
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,230
there were cracked out safe and of
course all the took locksmith courses as

506
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,180
I guess some people downstairs after

507
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,500
and they have licenses to make that the
that the proper case

508
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,000
and then there were some case that the
blanks were so secure that

509
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,400
even my sis locksmiths couldn't do this
and the case they would like going to

510
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,590
the machine shop in the word

511
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,730
forge their own keys there and yet the
poor guy

512
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,220
who had to add watch and the protect the
information

513
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,630
at the a AI love with was going on at
the time

514
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,680
us in the 60s is coming Russell NASCAR

515
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,880
where we talked of the sky user hacker
himself

516
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,000
I he had protection share with a lot of
hackers

517
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,790
as a lot explosives here it's
interesting

518
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,200
yeah II know why it is but talking
hikers over the years there really seems

519
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,370
to be ok to finance for

520
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,360
blowing things up so it's going NASCAR

521
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,600
a won the first job see how was work for
a company that that they

522
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,560
explosives and actually a range that
have poured a salary and prima cord

523
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,639
which was sorta and a explosive device

524
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,050
any other site hear that a yes as Boston
the winter

525
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:06,530
that he could like set this up on his
sidewalk a blow the snow offense

526
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:09,860
and and his wife got wind of it and PSOE

527
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:15,290
get the shuffle sauce over stuff anyway
but no he tried to try to try to get it

528
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,330
to stop hackers

529
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,649
it so finally he just he just gave up he
threw his hands up and said

530
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,470
you know and made a deal with the
hackers he said okay I'll stop putting

531
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,610
up the road blocks

532
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,540
if he'll stop for how you break into it

533
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,040
let's at least preserve the illusion the
things are safe

534
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,550
and this is sort of a precursor years
years in advance scott mcnealy state the

535
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,129
privacy is an illusion

536
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,810
they've really had a and I might say and
actually work pretty well

537
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,980
after that and one of the last people I
talk to

538
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,120
doing hackers it or not be serve a
postscript at the end of the book was

539
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,400
this guy I found

540
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,310
I'm sure as the first journal so effort
to speak to him was cutting Richard

541
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,770
Stallman

542
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:58,540
I'm you know it up but you know I

543
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,200
he looks the I look different too I
guess but I he looks really different

544
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,920
back then

545
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,440
and community was that this guy I like
sunlight his face

546
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,950
for years before I i talked to be like
live their lives in the aisle up

547
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:14,690
and at that point a lot was splitting
apart new guy I get into this--

548
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,510
in the book because you know there were
these companies that started

549
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,570
are competing with companies and one of
them you know

550
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,500
run by NASCAR actually arts tomahawks
evil in a single handedly trying to

551
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,330
match the output

552
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,429
another company and you know he it was
his heart was broken

553
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:35,730
because the day I'll up a was being
ruined by proprietary information

554
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,840
software for money and I

555
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,170
passwords the hit passwords and he had
this movement

556
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:46,430
than the a I'll up so use a carriage
return is a password

557
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:49,510
and about a third the people actually
kinda use that yerxa

558
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,680
as proudly saying we don't want your
stinka passwords

559
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,750
and I use a a carriage return their and
you know he

560
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,250
describe myself as the like this book
what he/she the last day of me about

561
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,550
this indigenous american in california
was last

562
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,810
this kind before he was that I read a
chapter about a

563
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:10,020
hope the young the last or two after
their

564
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,210
and you know a little realize that
Richard year

565
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:17,870
years from now with still be a at you
hacker but

566
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,380
quite joyfully no I feel interval
people's room

567
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,530
certainly not not the last above them it
was kinda funny because when I finished

568
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:28,649
Packers I had someone to pass the stick
you a

569
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:31,820
how mamet how commerce how greed

570
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:36,240
was gonna affect the hacker ethic and
act like I worried a lot about how that

571
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,790
with turnout but as it turned out not
only

572
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,540
did the hacker spear infuse everything

573
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:47,379
your by helping built their every
computer

574
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,130
and the people who designed the Internet
yet were again true hackers that

575
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,280
permeated

576
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,580
the whole internet and spread that the
hacker ethic everywhere

577
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,530
are you know but havoc now but the idea
of hockey in the classic sense i think

578
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,850
is making a comeback

579
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:06,050
and I really feel that all the benefits
we have of the digital age old evolution

580
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,770
evolution exit came from that all the
things we enjoy now

581
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,770
really came from the hackers we over all

582
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:19,770
to the hackers

583
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,610
so I have it in my book I you know I owe
my Apple to it's just a thing up

584
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,370
different things are

585
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,870
some chapters in the book were so long
they didn't fit on a single floppy disk

586
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,480
I had this

587
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,570
that this put out there and then of
course my publisher wouldn't take a book

588
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,899
in digital form what

589
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,460
and but they would even take it in a dot
matrix printer

590
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,200
they demanded I I think it looks like a
typewritten manuscript by the higher

591
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,480
at the ready daisy wheel printer printer
and kinda for that one line at a time

592
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,370
was like 13 charges a second at that
time and yeah for the book came out

593
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,910
and near a late 1984 I came out

594
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,360
in this person that imprint too many of
them sold out but

595
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:04,190
the ER your publisher the so what that's
good just leave it at that

596
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,690
and it wasn't really talk paperback the
it really

597
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,130
found its audience and I'm just so happy
to say that it's been a print ever since

598
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,350
and the No I i just get great feedback

599
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:19,219
up to to this day there I love just tell
today I

600
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:23,040
ran into Matt plays is a legend in his
own right and he told me that

601
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,469
a he was asked to stop by the people at
at Penn where he works that pick a book

602
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:29,520
which had an influence on the most and

603
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,550
and he picked actors in fact I thanks
Matt that means a lot

604
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:38,030
now after I wrote the book I had hoped
that that term

605
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,110
that I use the way I use the word
hackers in a positive sense in the

606
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,660
adventure a sense in the sense that

607
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,239
people you-know-who see freedom and
liberation in what they do which tech

608
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:51,030
but of course soon after that other word

609
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,450
became the great it became used has to
be synonymous with people who break into

610
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:56,989
computers whether they are perfect score

611
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,190
expert expertise or not and so

612
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,180
there was a conference it started you
know just when the book started us to

613
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,480
our brand and Kevin Kelly's

614
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,670
people holworth review decided a great
idea to get together so the people who

615
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,830
where the different generations a
Packers & and put them all together we

616
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,710
had a fantastic

617
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,850
I'll gathering called the first hacker
conference and still goes on

618
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,049
are to this day is picked up by some
other people and

619
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,800
and subsequent hacker conference is
there was a lot of hand-wringing about

620
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,320
the way this work was use

621
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,310
there especially that people are upset
the people who make just use scripts

622
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,049
they are nope

623
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:33,890
expertise a hockey whatsoever but people
said all these are hackers these are

624
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:34,420
hackers

625
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,380
and PS some other people people that
might a particular broke their heart

626
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,240
to hear that were used that way now I
have to say

627
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,010
I can't get that worked up about it
because skill I would sort of has its

628
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,500
own course it's like a river

629
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,690
you really can't stop a river that way
and I think a

630
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,480
walls a shame that word can be abused to
that and I look now and

631
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,140
see the word used to people or just pure
criminals with no our technical

632
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,160
expertise

633
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,609
and I think well these are hackers
certainly not in my book a

634
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:06,010
and it's unfortunate but I am sure some
courage that now

635
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,260
the word is coming back in the positive
sense in terms of people talk about

636
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,350
hacking the brain

637
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,480
where you got the Make Magazine movement
at near four eva gatherings like this I

638
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,840
think

639
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,980
are breaking away from the strictly
negative connotation and

640
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,470
and seeing it and in the terms you have
those close to the original

641
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,520
so I think that that's that's just too
terrific there and

642
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,920
you know a it's been you great to see
that evolution

643
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,690
and happier you I'm just happier than
ever that this movement is thriving

644
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:37,990
and you're here and that the you read me
listen to me

645
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:44,990
so I just say go forth and actually is
and thanks very much

646
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,870
so couple things I want a question
seemed kinda go to Mike request but

647
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,460
first we have the house lights on we're
gonna figure out to get up this book

648
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,220
your okay medulla

649
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,010
our raffle hack without her any kind of
rough could just come to your house

650
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:06,580
lights on

651
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,799
can someone hack

652
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,890
the house lights please maybe from your
chair so you can do this

653
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:20,180
this is this is this a hard one

654
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,419
we'll get along this is 3G battery
forces on OK

655
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,790
there we go okay so here's where to do
it I got a couple trivia questions

656
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,310
and there's very poorly speed partly who
can answer this

657
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:38,270
so anyone who knows who is the inventor

658
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,840
up the Cerro cellular automata game life

659
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:48,020
I didn't say go it out but if

660
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,840
I said I was going to ask if you get so
%uh

661
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:55,230
maybe I should get the ground rules the
game before right side here

662
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,370
I see worker workers hackers going to
accomplish okay

663
00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:01,440
so I'm gonna go some way to ask the
people who know

664
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,900
something the stand-up okay if you know
what the book don't stand up because you

665
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,960
might wind up for the book

666
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,260
52 when this trivia contest so

667
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,750
we all know of course that the event are
life was John Conway

668
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,320
life so we're not going to use a quest
okay

669
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,730
so stand-up if you want this book

670
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,910
you can sell on ebay all signed up

671
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,859

679
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,819
is also I miss Potter

680
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:12,190
well March 1975

681
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,239
did you know that I

682
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:19,599
the sorry hacked his way into that

683
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,509
so please questions and

684
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:26,869
on on hackers or anything I read about

685
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:31,329
crypto anything yeah

686
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,710
Steven M I'm actually reading crypto
right now it's a great book

687
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,079
I have a question for you you're talking
about the

688
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,109
information should be free and that
being a prime

689
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:45,339
Prime thing but then you have to

690
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:48,460
reconcile with privacy and

691
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,670
and I think you know these days privacy
is very important and

692
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,380
you know we have a lot going on to try
to make that

693
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,099
very publicly available to people how do
you reconcile the two things information

694
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:02,059
needs to be free

695
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:05,319
but yeah privacy let's I'll not

696
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,640
was that stuff from Unisa so what have a

697
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,670
you know the the thing about crypto and
what sort of

698
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:16,470
you know that the flip flip flip side
really of what happened at the Isle out

699
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,269
is actually had its origin hey I'll up
on one hand they have this

700
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:24,079
effort of total openness and on the
other hand some other people on one

701
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,349
person in particular that this guy with
diffi-

702
00:40:26,349 --> 00:40:29,640
who was a a hacker the a I'll up a had

703
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,470
this obsession with how do you protect
the secret and

704
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:37,259
he wound up to be the co inventor a
public key cryptography

705
00:40:37,259 --> 00:40:41,970
which i think gives us a way to deal
with the idea

706
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:47,289
a a free information in terms of
protecting it with cryptographic

707
00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:50,349
I think the tooo clearly there's a value

708
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:54,140
to privacy but I'll

709
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,299
you know there is also a it

710
00:40:57,299 --> 00:41:00,480
a huge value and making public
information

711
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,900
dead has no you justification to be
helpful

712
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,230
and in private their arm

713
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:12,109
the nature love digital technology a

714
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,269
like it or not brings a lot of our
personal information

715
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:19,160
out into the open and there is a
trade-off to what what we do

716
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,739
I think by and large by our actions we
vote with your feet just as

717
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,359
young people in a wet asses vote on this
issue with her feet

718
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,569
when they post private information on
Facebook I think the

719
00:41:29,569 --> 00:41:34,069
here you have to be your pretty dumb not
out any expectation at all

720
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:37,400
that when you post something semi-public
Lee it might not

721
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,509
come out in in the future there I'll you
know I'm a quite a pretty good up there

722
00:41:41,509 --> 00:41:41,890
is no

723
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,730
perfect solution to this but yeah I i do
feel

724
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:49,299
fit you think should be the more open up

725
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:52,349
no DRM the RM turns out to be real
counterproductive

726
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:56,109
arm but a in terms of your privacy

727
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:59,700
I'll one should be you careful about how
much

728
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,940
%um dolt and the pleasures the digital
age

729
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,109
if you're super concerned with a a were

730
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:09,680
you strong grip questions

731
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,058
on your shot

732
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,359
the last though last hope

733
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,779
alright well office of cyber couple
minutes but one more story here

734
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:23,910
has nothing to do with hacking but

735
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:27,640
you know it as before but I was to this
general freelance writer

736
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,650
I had an interesting story which is
where the hack

737
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:34,769
you know itself my editor I was work for
a magazine called new jersey monthly

738
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:38,579
original magazine and we try to stretch

739
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:41,700
an interesting story with it like
teenagers as we could

740
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,940
because a lot of stuff up the jersey
wasn't too interesting so

741
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,720
I'll I'm stein lived in New Jersey and
my other also this fascination

742
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,829
about what happened I'm stein's bring it
have been taken out of his head

743
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:59,269
after he died fortunately in 1955

744
00:42:59,269 --> 00:43:03,920
and that's what disappeared I'm your the
other I had tried to find it

745
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,119
some years before and ran into a total
brick wall in the isolated state

746
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,180
to didn't know what happened last year
it was an article in NYTimes 1955

747
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,529
saying that it was taken out of his head
at the autopsy and settle for study

748
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:19,170
but no one knew what happened to it my
editors at the I want you to find

749
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:21,589
einstein spring

750
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:26,078
so OK so I you just like the hikers like
I could try that

751
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,349
so I figured out I guess what happened
who took it out of his head the guy

752
00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:33,450
and you tried to trace the fellow down

753
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,930
I heard some rumors that piece of it
come out here and there

754
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:40,069
and finally figured out where this guy
was

755
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:43,210
and yet I was pretty sure this guy had
the brain

756
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,700
he was a doctor is the follow just to
the opt-out autopsy

757
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,469
and was living in Wichita Kansas and
working for some medical

758
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:53,549

759
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:57,099
myself doing a story but I stein's break

762
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:05,210
our hands well I did he seem reluctant
and I thought this

763
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,910

up talk so I flew to Wichita Kansas

764
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:14,359
and I met in his lap which was yet this
testing lab this guy

765
