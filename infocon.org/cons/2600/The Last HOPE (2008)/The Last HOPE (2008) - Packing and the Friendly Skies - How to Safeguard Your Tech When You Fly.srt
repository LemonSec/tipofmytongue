1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,280
this girl up to the regular ticketing
agent the way you normally would

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,200
they have to weigh your bags you can
play around a little bit with weights

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,990
if you're like me like I have a scale in
my garage with all my tech and I like

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,759
it's exactly forty 9.5 pounds everyone
my cases all the time

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,369
but if you really get the jamb like my
padlock is huge in the gun is pretty

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,439
heavy like I've done shit why put the
thing on this

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,710
on the scale and the way it and Michael
by the way I have to check a weapon and

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,029
then

9
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,369
that's five more pounds that is not on
the scale but essentially have to

10
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:32,519
chechyan how many bags if you haven't
overage you're paying for your overage

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,270
on this your frequent flyer once that's
established he say by the way miss

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:41,730
I have to you know I've to declare some
weapons be thinking

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,149
when you phrase that don't just be like
excuse me I have a gun

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,829
you know and I need to declare like the
sentence should come out in a normal

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,230
order like by the way I need to update
do you have any firearms forms

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:57,680
do not be surprised when they ask you
right there to verify that its unloaded

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,030
is the duty of the first check in agent
to first

18
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,199
just examining and I've had very easily
in a family behind you going to Disney

19
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:05,649
World

20
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,020
and you take it you like drop in mags
and clearing locking you here you go

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,210
and you put that together yeah it's
great

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,570
once they've done that the give you a
small card

23
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,040
that has to be you know left somewhere
in the bag they'll fill it out with your

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,200
flight number you sign it

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,360
it just says I verified that this is an
unloaded weapon and I've checked this

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,810
weapon

27
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,229
you will then lock your bags and be
taken to a secondary screening area

28
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:34,090
what really happens is the TSA will send
your stuff

29
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,950
through a rapid scan machine with you
standing there most at a time that's the

30
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,290
end it's locked at this point by the way
a locket

31
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,610
give it to them they usually won't care
they'll just be like alright

32
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,130
he tees had one done I see it I see that
some loaded

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,600
if I thank you sir have a good day if
they see anything like it. it's kinda

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:51,979
this

35
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,670
doesn't look closer to you cake can you
come over we need to look at some times

36
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,530
I call you over

37
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,930
they say could you please open the sir
okay now step back an affair

38
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,619
ok it's on loaded well we have it open
for good measure slob slob

39
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,640
okay no no residue I could you please
lock it up sir

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,979
I thank you very much that's all it is
it's basically getting the scan

41
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,190
out of the way while you're still near
your back as long as

42
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,489
nothing shows up on an X-ray machine
somewhere in the pals at the airport

43
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:19,739
with you nowhere near there

44
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,849
as long as they expected to see a
firearm as only one

45
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,920
there are some pointers I can give you
obviously I said

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,129
don't be a dumbass when you declare your
weapon most airlines I've never had a

47
00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:32,179
problem with at all

48
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,760
sometimes I have one person call
supervisor and so is this really the

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,230
policy sally is a solid

50
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,518
almost every place though they're really
well-educated up some people I know do

51
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,370
take the rules the actual federal
guidelines you can print them out on the

52
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,019
Internet the laminate them or their
least some their pocket

53
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,420
and the off chance you get someone to
give the static you can now look this

54
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,120
this is the rules right here but I've
never known anyone ever from IC hand

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,410
question is what about gun permits

56
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,140
I've never had to show any permits I've
never had to show any concealed carry

57
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,879
permits

58
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:06,040
um yeah they never came I've actually
checked firearms without showing my ID

59
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,950
at that that the check in desk I just
said I i'm on this flight and now this

60
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,220
is my confirmation number with my like
paper print out from Travelocity

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:20,220
yes question was do you have to carry an
hour can't be empty and it can be

62
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,450
completely empty it doesn't even have to
be a functioning firearm I will explain

63
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,000
to them

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,909
um obviously be smart but you name tags
on everything

65
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:34,480
if it gets lost or mishandled and it is
one of your carry pieces you want to not

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,739
have that wind up in ones that wholesale
clearinghouse store that lost baggage

67
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:39,000
goes to somewhere in Arizona

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,120
by the way if you do have a lost luggage
issue

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,010
and you've had to deal was late in the
past two socks right you watch the

70
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,870
fuckin on-the-spot personal service you
get when you like

71
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:55,870
I was traveling with firearms and they
didn't come out in that bag carry up

72
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,670
another tip I'll give you is keep things
when I say locked as much as possible

73
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,590
what I mean is the one of the first
times I ever did this

74
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,459
the woman said okay well we're gonna put
you here and then can you move over here

75
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:08,189
and then we're gonna way that here

76
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:12,769
at one point my bags went like on the
conveyor like away from me out

77
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,540
fuck do and they weren't locked yet cuz
I kind of was just in his in his own I

78
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,459
wasn't thinkin

79
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,269
and I said what you know you haven't
locked that shit lol hang on an aid to

80
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,419
call somebody in that it was five
minutes tryna

81
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,799
find some guy pulling back out to the
little flappy doors

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,270
that sucked keep your it's better to be
asked five times

83
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,070
what you know each can you please unlock
that one more time sir we have to blah

84
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,190
blah it's better that

85
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,090
the to have them vanish away and then
they weren't locked that defeated the

86
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,300
whole purpose of what you're done

87
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,660
sometimes the secondary screening area
with the rapid scan machine is far away

88
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,750
if you have another smart cards don't
get rid of it or if you had a

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,840
bag like carrier guy you know if you
grab a skycap

90
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,440
keep him around they love it by the way
gets them like the curbside guys to get

91
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,630
them into the hot air

92
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,990
and they loved alexi guns like wow this
is interesting so we'll talk about

93
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,960
skycaps and how that's awesome

94
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,039
and some airlines is very uncommon some
airlines are stupid with those

95
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,849
indicator labels very very uncommon now
but be mindful

96
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,690
like a way do they just put it you ma'am
you're allowed to put that on the

97
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:11,710
outside my bag excuse me sir that

98
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,090
you can't mark that their that's not a
problem much anymore

99
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,860
I don't be fooled you might be legal
shit what they just put on there before

100
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,740
they put away

101
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,270
sometimes you might see something like
this you might see a little

102
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:25,190
holographic sticker and I was like is
that a firearm think that's not allowed

103
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,360
as a great yell at the TSA

104
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,060
sometimes you might see just a big you
know strike be better this is usually a

105
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,070
overweight bag banner anything close to
50 pounds or above

106
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,400
for OSHA regulations they have to let
the the bag throwers actually know all

107
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,560
about a wrench my back

108
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,930
when I got this

109
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,699
and a little hologram just as a TSA
inspected and cleared a sticker

110
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,250
the TSA will put that on after that
Maggie goes to the rapid scan machine

111
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,560
that's what actually lets it go through
the rest to the airport without being

112
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,150
molested

113
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,300
and the other is an actual like airport
code and date in the Holograms he can't

114
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,910
take this

115
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,190
up

116
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,080
the general says it's a sticker on top
of the sticker thats reusable yes

117
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,690
although it would be the wrong date an
airport code if you like

118
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,719
you know if you if you another day a
couple more things on

119
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,910
funny keys are good thing to have all my
locks you might have seen the rotating

120
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,350
disc locks a lot of times people like
puzzled by the key while I say that

121
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,419
sometimes in the secondary area the TSA
will just ask for your

122
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,750
I can I have your key in case we need it
and liked it but the fuck

123
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,949
you know but I'll get lecture here take
this and they don't even realize what

124
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:31,810
it's like this is a key

125
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,990
okay and just so that I know when
they're wandering around behind the

126
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,740
machines

127
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,050
half the time if they need to get my bag
for some it's like I'm you show us how

128
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,330
this keyword we don't understand what
this is see I do like something goofy

129
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,229
with the key

130
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,270
your insurance you airlines are unsure
if they

131
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,639
lose your bags I kinda think that
conviction mmm

132
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,050
sexy makeup party in the middle height
of alright

133
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,340
I'll keep talkin biggest my slides are
much more attractive and I am so that's

134
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:57,900
all that matters

135
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,610
um yeah your your insurance may be
different

136
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,810
depending on what like if you're you
know you're traveling with your super

137
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:05,800
gold plated

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,470
when ridiculous otaku John fanboy
pistols they might not be covered by

139
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,150
airline insurance the way normal bag

140
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,440
would be I mention about playing around
to wait how you can kind of do that

141
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,289
funny ass if you don't put the gun in
before you ate a bag

142
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,490
question some people ask me is can the
gunby lacked

143
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:25,680
locked im sorry inside other bags like
you have a small hard sided case

144
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,000
with just a gun inside the a big case

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,229
yeah you could totally do that and it
counts as one bag it still counts as

146
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:33,280
locking the gun

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,580
but why you know we're talking about
like having giant cases

148
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,000
with one gun in like each of them
ideally seeking all your expensive tech

149
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,050
unlock it all up

150
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,900
that will happen to me once I was like
three boxes you've seen those three

151
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,610
cases

152
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,360
and I had a little like tiny on each
little pistol in each one

153
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,310
and checking ladies like you know you
probably could save yourself some time

154
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,460
and effort if you put all three in one
of the cases he wouldn't have to fill

155
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,719
out these forms just like yeah okay I'll
do that

156
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:00,960
thanks I'll take that tip for next time

157
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,710
excellent and someone as I see couple
hands now we have like back shell

158
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:12,710
question was if you have multiple bags
you wanna secured you need multiple guns

159
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:15,750
yes you do

160
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,240
a bag cannot be secured without some
declare a firearm in it sir I saw him

161
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:20,770
next to you

162
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,740
I'm sorry the quick alachua I am still
using the questions you only carry two

163
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,159
reciprocating state you're talking about
concealed carry and the laws

164
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,458
this has nothing to do with
concealed-carry you don't have to have

165
00:08:33,459 --> 00:08:37,079
any concealed carry permit I have the
Florida permit which is valid in 28

166
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,039
states but I'd

167
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,718
you never need your permit unless you
are actually walking into the airport

168
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:47,579
with a gun on your hip the colitis

169
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:50,589
the John this is my permanent no good
here well if I am actually

170
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,120
we can get into a whole thing about fire
unless I'm permitted if I was flying

171
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,839
into New York to flying with weapons in
my bag

172
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:00,250
and then if I'm staying at a hotel or
other residents to have them in my hotel

173
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,700
or legal residents a hotel is legally a
residence for fourth amendment purposes

174
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,589
when you're paying

175
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:09,220
as a patron you don't need a CCW to have
a gun even in new york in your hotel

176
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,620
by federal law doesn't mean the cops
mess with you but we can talk about

177
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,670
playing with that with the other
firearms thing I saw one and then we

178
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,060
gotta

179
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,970
keep similar related to that

180
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,520
he's asking if if I've ever been worried
about being in cabs and things i'd

181
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,089
question what I'm gonna carry sometimes
I'm never worried cuz I

182
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,860
I i've never carried my guns to New York
or to DC even though

183
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,070
what's the latest ruling on is it Miller
how's that going these days it

184
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,130
heller we act we actually have the
fucking Constitution back in DC

185
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:43,130
alright I did see your hand we're gonna

186
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,510
keep rockin for a bit okay cell

187
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:51,060
why do I say not just functional
firearms apart this process

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,180
all the following things are declare a
ble as firearms in fact you are

189
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,100
obligated

190
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,410
to declare them as firearms and you
allow the lock your backs

191
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,900
I have bought nine dollar Chinese spring
airsoft guns of the bay

192
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,470
like three of them for nine dollars they
came from hong kong they took a month

193
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,569
and this big

194
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:13,390
they are firearms for the purposes of
declaring your bags

195
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:16,540
anything that will show up on a rapid
scan machine

196
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,240
that looks like a firearm they wanna
have it document it they want the form

197
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,110
in the case that one already have dealt
with that they don't want to be

198
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:26,949
tripped by the low-wage never
interacting with another human being

199
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,990
bag jockey at a screen the bows at the
airport

200
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,449
so all these things count I have replica
pieces

201
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:36,550
I have obviously a rifle internationally
with my airsoft guns

202
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,720
because you can fly to other countries
that Airsoft GI fine or with my airsoft

203
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,860
guns

204
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,079
up Canada you can't fly without you can
have your soft in Canada

205
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,199
if you know that they'll confiscate them
beats me why so I fly with training

206
00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:49,089
replicas or theatrical props

207
00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:51,839
they don't have liked working slides or
anything I'm like this I'm doing a

208
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:52,760
theater piece

209
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,870
up this is for performance whatever it
counts

210
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:00,910
shotgun chokes receivers bear receivers
I know a bunch of my friends and I

211
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,430
we don't know what's going to happen
next election we've been stocking up on

212
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,620
a our receivers because they're cheap

213
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,040
um and you they'll be grandfathered in
by the way look on Gun Broker dot com

214
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,750
ninety dollars for like a stripped

215
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,990
their receiver for an AR the you can't
have legally

216
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,329
but yeah I mean you might get a funny
look when checking in a personal say are

217
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:18,270
you sure that was

218
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,060
I don't think you have to declare that
certainly so I have the form right here

219
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,490
lady I wanna break the law

220
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,910
and I want my padlock so yeah a lot of
these things account

221
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:30,449
one last Perl wisdom I love to tell
people there are ways you can sometimes

222
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:31,459
slip in line

223
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:35,490
when you declared firearms they really
boils down to

224
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:39,170
Graham skycap there's a lot of ways in
game the system but the best one

225
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,569
is gonna curbside check in have your
five bucks you're gonna tip the scales

226
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,709
like the little smart car cost three
bucks anyway

227
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,730
who cares two more boxes circa I need
some help

228
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,350
and he'll start load your bags you say
move shoot I don't think I can do

229
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,939
curbside check in because I have to
declare firearms don't have to go in is

230
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:56,490
oh that's okay sir let me get the for

231
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,400
and the taking the side door and ask you
to pass all the lines and they all know

232
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,550
the check in staff

233
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,319
start bob Sally I can I borrow one you
over here this guys are checking if I

234
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,829

235
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,890
it also thank you very much to mail
thank you I'm going to give you five

236
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,380
dollars and

237
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,390
and there had their I tell you they're
delighted they're like what do not know

238
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,829
that sounds interesting what kinda old
issue Lobdell bullshit with your

239
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:21,540
the stick around and not taking over the
TSA for the secondary screening

240
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,650
sell for an extra couple bucks you're
not only not

241
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,689
you know carry on bags you're skipping
lines your

242
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:30,469
urine really good shape I recommend
trying it what's the worst you gonna

243
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,439
have the first guys gonna say oh yeah
you're right

244
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,980
curbside you can't do I'll take you to
line sir

245
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,699
keep the world quickly as question what
do I personally use

246
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:43,920
I'll give you the breakdown it works
really well for me you can

247
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,319
adjust it to your own you know
contrivances but essentially

248
00:12:47,319 --> 00:12:51,150
the biggest thing I have 81 round a in
within 10 min or more around cases

249
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,790
i buy am really cheap you can these are
15 freakin dollars

250
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,890
like used they are cheaper than any
pelican case you gonna find

251
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,860
a you can kick the shit out of them

252
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:06,510
question was how heavy are they there
empty their like less than a pound

253
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,530
maybe to pounce the crash was to never
tested

254
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,720
for residue keep the um

255
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,089
ives that some really it was a really
good question and I've never tripped

256
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,760
residues answers so

257
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,089
that's kinda really fuckin funny um

258
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:29,089
I see a hand yes

259
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,910
really points out usually unless you've
been to arrange that day I have loose

260
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,529
powder

261
00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,790
from the ordinance prolly won't trip and
yet these are so used there's like sand

262
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,430
in the bodies from ninety one in the
gulf war when i buy them

263
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:48,430
%uh was there hander up

264
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,439
the question was %uh blunt horse
throwing weapons not range weapons

265
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:56,000
they do not count I've tried flying with
even like K bars and stuff

266
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,130
and they won't do they once declared as
a check a weapon

267
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,810
up I will tell you it's about two feet
the question is how the is about two

268
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,760
feet by

269
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,370
maybe a foot in the Hat less if a half
as about eight inches deep it's a

270
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,650
sizable Kate you'll see when it on the
lockpick village we have all the gear

271
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,860
and someone was saying so but I'm gonna
keep on crack what we need to turn that

272
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,530
Q&A only on time we like i'm talking way
too fast just a little jest but

273
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,000
alright I'm ever so happy to be here we
have like an awesome time so you get

274
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,680
your talk done and then it's like

275
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,700
you know happy time there s an icon this
is the way to do it

276
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,040
so I don't just go with a bear case I
actually

277
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,449
will add an extra hasp on from that you
can %uh fine he said you know hardware

278
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:39,710
stores find the heaviest hasp you can
find

279
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,110
obviously instead of screwing I will
drill through and use bolts

280
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,820
LGB welder Loctite the bolts on once you
have that

281
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,230
really just comes down to what padlock
you can find I personally love

282
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,640
these heavy rotating disk Evie Abbas
locks on for a variety of reasons and

283
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,439
not super expensive I'll give the URL's
in prices in a minute

284
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,790
but out yeah lifestyle I really just
more than anything I love the key

285
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,530
puzzles everybody they don't know how to
use it so half the time the league old

286
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,920
okay so we don't have to open this up

287
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,510
what is all this set me back very very
little like

288
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:17,150
I knocked all this together the the most
expensive thing is the padlock by a huge

289
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,670
margin

290
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:21,710
you know you can you can put some paint
on it may be a little piece of fabric or

291
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,030
sack to cover the padlock but for well
under a hundred dollars

292
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:28,140
you have no like no worries

293
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,250
ever fly and for as anxiety Laden and

294
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,040
pissing me off as everything else about
air travel is these days that's a very

295
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,370
good investment in my book

296
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,910
to not have to have one less thing that
I have zero fretting about

297
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,560
for less than a hundred grand 100 CNN
like I'm all over that

298
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,740
that's really that's that's what boils
down too so it's all Q&A from here

299
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,740
thanks

300
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:00,209
so wave around and shout or something if
you have questions and here if we can

301
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,559
get some others items I see

302
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:06,429
1&2 and I see some more yes he's

303
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:12,358
work that's a very good question the
general says what about how much are

304
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:15,329
they replica or proper we talking can
use a squirt gun

305
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:20,289
um essentially its anything's that could
have a ballistic

306
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:23,859
you know purge anything could be even
remotely dangerous any type of range

307
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,369
weapon

308
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:28,999
I don't think a squirt gun really
qualifies but airsoft in BB guns because

309
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:29,709
they do

310
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,299
act is some sort of a weapon would
probably and also because they often

311
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,049
have some

312
00:16:34,049 --> 00:16:38,199
mechanical parts in them ask or any
score cuz you're probably pushing it

313
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,129
like but again dollar store square
converses like

314
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:46,160
four dollar spring gun make go one
investment up higher than that

315
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,419
and even so like even though they
probably would give the static checking

316
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:52,189
in I wouldn't take like a score con on
the plane

317
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,478
just because they'll yell you probably
at the carry on check

318
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:58,829
so maybe it would be tell you what you
know if you try it

319
00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,459
tell me what happens and I'll post it on
my website I i don't think I put the URL

320
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:05,399
deviating dotnet slash firearms as we
can find on my

321
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,299
lectures you find the slides up you know
I'll post more stuff later I

322
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:15,429
next US question sure

323
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,189
um I've had the question was gonna share
more store and i got plenty of stories

324
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:20,610
if we run into questions by the way

325
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,669
I can I share more stories about
international travel

326
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:28,139
for the most part um I've had more
questions

327
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:33,419
at customs about things like handcuffs
and why I'm traveling with 70,000 like a

328
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,070
lock picks

329
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,090
that I have about the airsoft gun the
acres air site say what is that what is

330
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:40,580
that what is this is sick for the be
like what is is gone

331
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,879
and legal notes and its clearly plastic
and has a big orange tip

332
00:17:43,879 --> 00:17:47,370
on the %uh like that you can see this is
this is an airsoft gun I'm gonna do %uh

333
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,529
some some some

334
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:51,960
you know fun BB shooting with my friends
later on out you make something up when

335
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,740
I really I'm gonna go to this %uh
security con much the guys are gonna do

336
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,240
practice target shooting I don't know

337
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,360
but yeah I mean that they don't care if
airsoft is legal way you're going it's

338
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,070
not like

339
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,820
bring in anything else I've had more
questions about knives and handcuffs and

340
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,178
stuff than anything else in that

341
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,440
um I saw a couple of I see hand yes

342
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,000
the question is can a minor declare a
weapon

343
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,830
that's a really fascinating question not
being a minor and I haven't known

344
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,850
and I broke it off with that
fifteen-year-old way before i sorry

345
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,610
trying this

346
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,230
so I don't know I would probably be
willing to bet

347
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:30,620
especially continent like if you're in
the US there are states where miners can

348
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,510
legally own

349
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,360
I would be surprised to think that the
federal law would apply any differently

350
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,960
to them

351
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,470
like if you're traveling from I don't
know like Virginia to Alabama

352
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,889
and if you're seventeen you have you
know the shotgun that you got last year

353
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:43,179
for you

354
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:47,019
I bet you could do it and I'd be
fascinated to see how that would work

355
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:50,240
I'd love to see how that would work
simply somebody with kids try it and

356
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,679
tell me

357
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,769
there was a question here and I think I
saw

358
00:18:53,769 --> 00:19:00,769
you with a question as well of

359
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,750
the question was what a class three xot
transferring and traveling up with Class

360
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,200
three

361
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,760
you know and if a type type weapons did
you write the paperwork is only involved

362
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,049
in transferring of weapons from
ownership between parties

363
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,200
if you're if you if you own it and you
I'm going to

364
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,679
event I'm gonna need it and I'm it's
Mike and I'm gonna bring it back

365
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,929
you're not selling it or transferring it
between individuals there is no

366
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:23,619
paperwork

367
00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:29,840
up outage

368
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,158
up sorry interstate the a I'd totally
spaced on that one

369
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:37,289
there are there are some federal forms
the of to notify but again I don't think

370
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,809
you need their clearance I think you
just have to submit notification but

371
00:19:40,809 --> 00:19:43,129
this was like I don't have any class
three-year can I still live in New

372
00:19:43,129 --> 00:19:43,610
Jersey

373
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,889
but when I do get something I've had it
on my list for a while

374
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll probably be awash in all those
standards and and headaches

375
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,389
I know that every year people used to
come to the Def Con shoot with

376
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:57,240
farrakhan's and saws and other things
like that and so there's there deftly

377
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,320
ways to do it there probably is a
declaration process you have to send us

378
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,039
some big names agency somewhere

379
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,629
panic I'll

380
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:09,039
for those who don't get a lot of your
time a class 3 weapon is

381
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,510
a full automatic or other weapons
covered by the National Firearms Act

382
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,559
you know through real fun stuff yes
silencer short barreled shotguns

383
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,860
I sent yet destructive devices ornate
launchers yeah

384
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,960
oh yeah and I'd like to declare my you
know I'm 7940 male

385
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,360
yes question what do I normally carry

386
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,740
um well you saw the very first slide the
present I usually have Gladys

387
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,080
I'm going to shooting event and if I'm
not

388
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,340
traveling with her then kinda just a
little spring on the little crappy

389
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,860
airsoft guns

390
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,919
the little like airsoft pistols cuz
they're cheap indyk I basically just

391
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,159
keep them in my tool cases

392
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,529
because I'm going to some like travel
mostly for Khan's so I'm just %uh

393
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:54,389
a religious guy I've been sometimes
going to an airport like I guess I

394
00:20:54,389 --> 00:20:55,679
didn't need that is a

395
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,889
shoot oh well but yet their spring guns
I see a

396
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:02,169
I had back there no

397
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't see him I see hand appear

398
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,789
the question was ammunition gun
components clips in magazines

399
00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:15,408
ammunition usually the policy is it has
to be

400
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,950
in a non like it can't be in the weapon
sometimes they actually say

401
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,619
this is an airline policy it should be
any fabric or fibrous

402
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,070
container basically the cardboard box
p.m. comes in

403
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,700
some airlines do not have that policy
and you can actually use the magazine

404
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,129
as a as a stick at them at them the
devil can be loose SB in a container

405
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:40,269
some magazines can count as a container
if they're in a holster

406
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:43,299
because the did the mat basically Emma
can't be exposed

407
00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:47,710
in any way there has to be inside of
something so picture if you drop a mag

408
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,710
and then like the little half-height mag
clips the waren if you stuff the top the

409
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,859
magazine in that then there's no exposed

410
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:57,199
rounds that counts %uh there are also
quantity

411
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,850
up you know limitations so beware that
if you have a certain type

412
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,139
like you've loaded your own hand loads
you going to a special issue

413
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:07,590
you can't just expect to bring tons of
them there are definite limits their

414
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:12,859
I don't know what they are because they
vary per airline but call the airlines

415
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:16,500
questions what about ammunition only
that's a very good question that I've

416
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:16,970
never

417
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,250
had to personally deal with I know you
would have to declare it he say I'm not

418
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,440
traveling with amo

419
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,149
you might get a raised eyebrow if you
don't have the gun to go with it

420
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:28,580
again social engineer them be like oh
well I'm the guns are you there

421
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,109
I I'm shooting my uncles guns but I have
to bring extra ano you probably could

422
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,269
get away with it

423
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:37,289
but against its amo there's so much gray
area per airline

424
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,470
everyone has their own weird policy so
there might be an airline out there with

425
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,200
no

426
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,289
amo only policy I don't know check their
check the airline's first

427
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:48,769
you're never gonna run afoul policies
though as I'd like to remind people with

428
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:50,330
just a plastic gun nomo

429
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:57,330
you'll never ever have a problem with
any airline ever yessir

430
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,669
question was can use a combination lock
instead of the keylock

431
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,940
um well you probably could but we
wouldn't recommend masters dial

432
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,710
combinations how many people have seen
the

433
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,369
aluminum cans him %uh and which one yeah

434
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:15,010
paper he is now you can do that with
paper to elaire 1i like made a video

435
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,929
with paper

436
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,869
opening those locks um so yeah if
there's one good dial combination

437
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:24,399
locketts by Sargent and Greenleaf its
either the 80 88

438
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:28,490
for the 80-77 is the latest version
there the filing cabinet locks

439
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,889
for the DOD so if you really want a
combination

440
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:36,070
lock that's a good lock sergeant
greenleaf I see a1 and a2

441
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:43,070
you're filming I'm sorry your not asking
questions with yes sir

442
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:46,859
the question was does this get you have
any checked baggage fees I know it is

443
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,279
not

444
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,679
you're not given any preferential
treatment like all your checking this so

445
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,470
we we're not gonna charge you extra for
your third bag

446
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,429
yeah the only treat you can specially
get is thus keeping in line you're still

447
00:23:56,429 --> 00:23:57,039
gonna face

448
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,539
bag fees if you have too many bags you
so in the face overweight fees

449
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:05,619
if they're too heavy um that yeah
there's nowhere and unfortunately

450
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,330
I C one and two

451
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,289
excellent point the lady asked can you
fill out these little declaration cards

452
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,049
in advance

453
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:18,529
or can you have to do at the counter
most air I always ask because I hate

454
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:19,230
standing there

455
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,169
try like you know I like to be the guys
in gone I like to be that guy

456
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:26,409
and I hate it when someone else is not
that guy so

457
00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:30,149
I hate standing I i asked every time you
get these online or something I always

458
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:30,480
get

459
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,119
oh yeah they've been meaning to put
those on the website but they haven't

460
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:33,889
yet

461
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,720
they're not special forms there's no
like mag stripe and then there's no

462
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
barcode there's no

463
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,919
contact that sometimes they have little
you know carbon paper on the back

464
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,369
but supposedly they're stuck at they're
gonna put these online they haven't yet

465
00:24:45,369 --> 00:24:48,490
there's they don't change so you know
you could go to an airport

466
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,389
if you fly one carrier all the time and
they're not restricted email can I have

467
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:53,429
fifty of those

468
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:57,279
cards you know just take home %uh so
you're allowed to show up with the party

469
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,960
filled out if you know your flight
number

470
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,429
question different form for different
airlines yes they all do the same thing

471
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,520
but every airline has their own standard
um

472
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,950
technically the TSA and that the people
running a scan machines are the ones who

473
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,490
are looking in and seeing that the card
is in there

474
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:18,619
so they don't really care but ultimately
I you probably can't just I wish they

475
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,859
had a generic one that would really be
not as much as I hate

476
00:25:20,859 --> 00:25:24,080
any federal standards for any oversight
I'd love a generic card

477
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,908
winning a one into said

478
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,440
no the question was just traveling with
firearms affect my decision to drink on

479
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,240
a flight

480
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,559
ob very very little in this world
affects my decision to drink

481
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:45,970
and I saw question over here

482
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,960
okay

483
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,320
hmm

484
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:00,369
mmm the gentleman points out he lives in
New York were even things like airsoft

485
00:26:00,369 --> 00:26:01,859
can be problematic

486
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:06,129
um what about flying with non receiver
just any weapon component but that's not

487
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,330
a receiver

488
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,658
I've I've never flown with just like a
choke or slide

489
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:13,909
up I'd welcome someone to try it usually

490
00:26:13,909 --> 00:26:17,240
its the restricted item that triggers
this you know

491
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,450
sore this betsy my again my bet would be
you're gonna get questions

492
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,649
by somebody at the front desk when you
try to check in

493
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,760
say no I'm sorry you can even you know
again social engineers say

494
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,399
I specifically called the TSA I spoke to
Bob extension 47 they don't fucking know

495
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:33,559
bob

496
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,270
and he assured me that I should check it
and I shouldn't have my carry-on I

497
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,408
really I feel comfortable if I check it

498
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:43,710
please call your supervisor if they have
to and call supervisor over and

499
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,570
you can they're going to err on the side
of caution they're going to err on the

500
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,678
side of declaring something a firearm

501
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,039
even if they're not sure usually as long
as its again I've

502
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,559
always struck out with bladed weapons I
used to try it every now and then before

503
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,309
had a bunch of their sauce that I bought

504
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:01,399
on e-bay and but yeah if it's any said
the gun component

505
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:04,149
and they're gonna be ice where there's
gotta be something legal even in new

506
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:06,450
york leaks theatrical stage props

507
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,330
now really Owen in new york city proper
you're talking

508
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,830
yep okay

509
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,289
um then yeah I would say look into into
items component items

510
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:24,799
I saw is that a hint yessir

511
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,089
the question was have I ever had
increased additional security screenings

512
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:28,760
on No

513
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,779
I used to be 4s all the time for reasons
that never

514
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:35,230
you know I never could find out and now
that I'm not I never get subjected to

515
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,359
extra screenings and pat downs and

516
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,439
now that I'm like a little bit older and
don't always have the crazy freak out

517
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:40,899
hacker

518
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:44,220
all-black attire I have cruised through

519
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,639
all that the regular screenings like F
you learn this eventually like you stop

520
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:51,129
making your hair blue and you get one
t-shirt from your friend is a Fed

521
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:54,399
York fruits through all the rest the
chechans

522
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,020
by the way the best shirt ever is not
any specific three-letter agency

523
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,250
its someone help me with the acronym is
the federal training

524
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,960
center what is that there there was one
federal agency

525
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,589
and I used it's a 4-letter acronym and
they do all the training

526
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:14,639
for basically federal minions everyone
who has a TSA uniform is monkeys your

527
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:16,760
bags they went through their training
program

528
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,869
the one logo they're going to recognize
so you know make a fake T I think this

529
00:28:20,869 --> 00:28:23,159
whole thing you can make a friggin
teacher

530
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,349
you know make a t-shirt line on the
federal trade the agency I'll awesome

531
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:27,099
you know

532
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:30,070
you not gonna lie to him you don't you
don't say yes I work for this agency

533
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,500
know you'd like us. know this you show
up with the

534
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,750
the polo shirt that says FBI and you're
gonna not get looked at twice whereas

535
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,520
the other kid right next to you with the
blue hair on the shirt that's like I

536
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,559
poems or the Gibson

537
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:44,889
is gonna you know he's gonna get search
so that's

538
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,149
I've never had any court there's no
correlation between what you check

539
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:51,980
and whether you do or don't yet extra
screening

540
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,109
you got a shot at me if you're in the
back I can't see you in the back

541
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:58,689
icy snow oh there's plenty so I saw a
jump in person

542
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,700
then I see awaiting person that I heard
a voice and there might be someone here

543
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,450
jumping for some

544
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:12,899
I'm sorry say again upstart absolutely
starter pistols you can declare

545
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:16,299
are you glad to have them in New York
service whilst

546
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:19,470
nope all right you can't eat dick in the
sink um

547
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,080
yeah anything especially something that
we have a report and would have probably

548
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,270
a rotating cylinder

549
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,408
yellow yet they they would count I sauce
I herds I will do jump will be waiting

550
00:29:28,409 --> 00:29:29,330
person

551
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:36,119
yes all

552
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:40,299
eighty percent receiver

553
00:29:40,299 --> 00:29:47,299
I actually haven't heard that for his

554
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:51,820
so it's transferable

555
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,099
I would say your the question was eighty
percent recite have I now that I've

556
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,589
I've heard people talk about that it's
when they don't have a license to do

557
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:59,010
Smith thing but they

558
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,599
yet if you've side to mill receive you
guys all know that

559
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:06,178
a receiver just the court no trigger
assembly or anything the receiver is

560
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,619
legally the gun

561
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,899
that's the part that's transferable with
trouble and you have to you know

562
00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:14,539
again if you're in vet invest in your
class the cops in your Sona rifles

563
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:19,220
now by receivers if you're milling a
receiver but it's not complete

564
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:23,679
chances are you're gonna get even more
square head-scratching crazy looks

565
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,260
from the front line check again it's
just the front desk checking people

566
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,039
they have to get past the TSA does not
care as long as you have the card that

567
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,260
they ask you to fill out their gonna do
their job

568
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,049
at the front desk people are the ones
who don't wanna do extra work

569
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:40,830
and no sir you don't need to do that you
know I've had that you know know this is

570
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,699
really is a theatrical replica I do need
to do that

571
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,019
so something like a receiver you're
going to get weird enough looks eighty

572
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,159
percent receiver

573
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,019
I imagine we generate even more and
because it's not categorized

574
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:55,289
and tracked by the Fed for
transferability purposes you could

575
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,330
probably have a supervisor get called
over

576
00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:00,908
and then you're gonna have serious you
know headaches at that point is really

577
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:03,740
you know imagine someone who's doing
this for the reason i'm talking about.

578
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,450
you showing up with all your expensive
tak

579
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,029
it's in the bag you probably have a
heavy padlock the you don't wanna throw

580
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,730
in your pocket

581
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,720
and be told you can have it you know I
probably wouldn't go that route

582
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,799
unless you just happen to have a bunch
of a percent receivers laying around and

583
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,869
it's the simplest thing for you I would
say

584
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:21,970
spend three dollars on e-bay because
it's gonna be no headaches

585
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,970
and no grey areas there was a voice in
there's a hand in hand

586
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:34,940
min

587
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,470
I very good I thought about that

588
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,599
by self actually the gentleman points
out there's no

589
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,450
marking that's allowed saying this is a
firearm that they're not allowed to slap

590
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,419
it on there but clearly if I'm putting

591
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:51,669
honking non TSA padlock on my bag

592
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:54,669
something is afoot it that's why I said

593
00:31:54,669 --> 00:31:58,450
in my price list maybe you get some
fabric or so like

594
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:02,169
you know like just imagine a stripper
fabric with Velcro or you're gonna

595
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:03,049
knotted up

596
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:06,918
so just like you know the straps that
hold back shot just put a giant one

597
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:09,760
around the bag and not upset the locks
not visible

598
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,820
or some people have those like little
battles bags would like cinch sacks per

599
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,689
year all your 12 sided dies or whatever
the fuck you guys do in the basement

600
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:17,899
library

601
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:21,609
you know like those little bags like
this is my el fish goblin bag

602
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,329
you know slip that'll be a la cancion
shit shot

603
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:29,059
I would say yeah that's a good point to
keep in mind a giant lock

604
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:32,289
is just as much an indicator but again
at that point

605
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:35,549
I don't think a bag thrower is gonna you
know shove that

606
00:32:35,549 --> 00:32:39,779
box in his pants and get off the airport
grounds that's less like that I'm less

607
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,470
afraid of that I am someone popping the
bag open

608
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,730
I saw one hand I'm sorry it's the time

609
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,820
yeah that was random I should stone in
Philly

610
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:53,510
yes we added a gun to the time um

611
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,070
one hand and is awaiting cell phone
later hand that's awesome that smart

612
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,629
yessir pay Paul that weapons absolutely
count

613
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,690
I I wouldn't recommend traveling with
the tank see a compressed air tanks are

614
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:08,659
a whole separate tub airline policy

615
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:12,679
you gotta alright yeah I'd love to make
you purge valve open anti-tank

616
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,090
but I absolutely that looks enough like
a gun its metal it has an action that

617
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,619
moves they're not gonna want that

618
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:24,619
undeclared something back there

619
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,460
yeah

620
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,960
I was it was locked bag chase Hamel
chase a locked bag but was soft bag

621
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,409
so was ripped apart yeah all that you
told me about that yet you had a gun

622
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:47,340
inside in another case yeah that's
that's the one we see that coming out

623
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,159

624
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,159

625
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:08,540

626
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:13,119
holy Christ

627
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,429
while is that back in the day when they
were openly tagged or

628
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:23,429
mother

629
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,380
mmm-hmm

630
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,250

631
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,270

out that she apparently Chicago's

633
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,540
Airport tutorials for vanishing bags

634
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,399

639
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,310
hand here

640
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,679
no alright you lose um someone over here

641
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:03,560
yes

642
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,160
I he said he had items added to his bag

643
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,350
I

644
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,960
you guys ever see johnnie long stock
where there was a woman who found TSA

645
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,310
uniforms in her bag

646
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:20,359
accidentally yeah so good I was

647
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:26,720
I'm sorry that's a great story to tell
go on sir up

648
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,760
but what caused me to look into all this
it was definitely that incident in

649
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,369
Philly

650
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,720
um where I lost like over a thousand
dollars for the pics unlock some other

651
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,270
tools

652
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:39,720
like might wanna I used to have those
cases as you saw them but they were just

653
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,970
clasped and came out %uh the bottom of
the you know airport like hanging open

654
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,780
and like my knives work on my pics were
all gone don't even know someone stole

655
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,130
them

656
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,900
or if they just rifle they like dump
them all over the florida what it was

657
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,730
like incompetence

658
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:55,200
or thievery but that was that was the
clincher for me eyes like this this

659
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,310
fuckin sucks there's

660
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:59,609
and I reginae is working I was familiar
that it's possible so I started really

661
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:00,330
looking into it

662
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,869
I see a hand here um

663
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,100
Shire Shack who Schneier well

664
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,250
how you become too hope Jesus yeah

665
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:15,119
arm Google google is your friend notion
I result like

666
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,300
base with the father crypto and big big
into open information and he's

667
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,810
year you can ever cease-fire talkies and
excellent excellent person to hang out

668
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,529
with historical

669
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,080
what a real time that we like 15 minutes

670
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,710
so if there's a couple more I that some
people shouting stories I'll give you

671
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,760
one story that'll do some work what is
my questions

672
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,670
um this is a story I think

673
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,540
this actually happened as told but I
heard it a little bit through a great

674
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:40,940
fine

675
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,330
so maybe it didn't quite happen this way
but I'll I like to imagine it

676
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:47,960
sometimes you get people at airports the
ticketing and check in

677
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,100
agents who are so they just think
everything's mundane they've been there

678
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,290
for they made a very horribly wrong
career decision

679
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,869
and they've worked this job for too long
and they've seen everything including

680
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:57,660
firearms

681
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,819
so party of three fellows are checking
in for a flight

682
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,960
and the first guy goes up by the way I
need to clear firearm

683
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,910
she has I need to see that is unloaded
searches at the end of your shift and

684
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:08,109
she's had too long a day

685
00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,920
okay and he opens his bag you know pops
a Cinderella revolver

686
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,960
it there's nothing in it I don't have
any ammo thank you very much

687
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,000
okay locking up going your way sir the
next guy comes up

688
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,250
is %uh I need declare firearms I need to
see that is unloaded

689
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:24,530
and this guy and you've all men if you
come to Def Con is a long-standing

690
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,020
vendor

691
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,869
he pulls his carry peace drops the mag
racks the roundout the chamber

692
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:34,450
lets the round back in the mag and cup
set up a ghost that's the demand this is

693
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,880
unloaded clocks the slide it and he
likes it

694
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,760
and moments like Jesus Christ

695
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,800
so that he's fine

696
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,920
and the third person the party and the
woman is still like you know steely eyed

697
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,680
board lady here I did Claire firearm on
need to see that it's unloaded sir

698
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,960
you know the drill by now that kinda
thing he opens up you know biggest

699
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,190
pelican case and it's an m249 saw

700
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,590
so you like clearing lock and he is
would you like me to show you how to

701
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,930
verify its unloaded fish

702
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,839
so that's that's the best %uh firearm
story I've ever

703
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,859
all this one other one bizarre I'll give
you do we have adequate

704
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:15,790
do Merkel questions are important to
have questions shout I can see it I some

705
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,590
selling stories

706
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,190
or wrap it up with this one I attribute
this morning a language barrier than

707
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,960
anything else

708
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,040
because I was flying back from hack in
the box

709
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:27,690
in Malaysia and I mean you've seen these
these cases

710
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,460
there sometimes you get old depending on
how big your stuff is like oh you have

711
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,950
to go to the a heavy

712
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,960
bag oversight baggage kinda thing in a
they sent me to oversize baggage Simon

713
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,220
KL Airport but the people barely speak
English at the ticketing

714
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,570
desk the guy who's like hired because he
can lift heavy shit

715
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:49,640
really has no command of English so I
show up with these you know I'm stumped

716
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,618
on some from someone is on the thing

717
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,300
and I assume he meant to inquire

718
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,660
are you traveling with firearms today
good sir

719
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,140
I wasn't the time actually is before I
did this but you know I assume that's

720
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,868
what he meant to ask

721
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:06,960
but in his limited capacity for English
she looks at the cases

722
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,180
looks at me looks the cases letting us

723
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:16,680
no bombs yes

724
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,290
and I was like you know I'm done that
said I'm outta here

725
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:27,290
so thank you very very much this is
going great by me later

726
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,119
and right on top
