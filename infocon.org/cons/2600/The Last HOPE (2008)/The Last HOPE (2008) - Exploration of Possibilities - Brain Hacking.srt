1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:15,050
you

2
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,390
alright Tom I guess we're ready to get
started them

3
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,730
be I suffer some announcements %uh

4
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,500
friend if you are interested %uh DVD's
on selling all talks %uh

5
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,150
down to happen %uh death yet as in
school right

6
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,440
um in the area over here on the
eighteenth floor

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,600
and %ah Robert six books are on sale

8
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,780
the DVD store until his spy improv talk

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,990
manner %ah

10
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,350
I'm making a lot of sleep the past few
days so

11
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,479
bear with me alright so today

12
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,979
I'm here to talk with the everybody
about

13
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:28,630
the human brain and ultimately have to
believe that system

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,810
to me this topic is interesting for you
know number reasons

15
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,149
but among those reasons is

16
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,310
the possibilities for

17
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,940
all hackers all types stereotypically
hackers have been known

18
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,569
as people with good technical skills but
also

19
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:52,319
was antisocial and not always with great
source

20
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,470
social skills and i am.

21
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,500
this obviously is not always true but it
would be in Cincy

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,940
at some point in the future hacker
became known stereotypically as

23
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,539
person who instead had very good
interpersonal skills

24
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:09,598
and a deep inside to what makes people
tick

25
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:15,920
of course the most important thing i've
investigating these possibilities is to

26
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,170
learn how to protect yourself

27
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,959
so mom brand hacking in one form another
has existed for

28
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,569
quite a while most brought up but I love
them is a social engineering which

29
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,099
must be a priority aware of and by
taking somewhat modern understanding of

30
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:34,720
the brain

31
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,950
into account with the program is
perception of things

32
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,050
new possibilities seem to open up
allowing

33
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,790
somebody not only manipulate people with

34
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,450
battled with spit also by virtue of
having an understanding how they think

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:54,020
but of anyway first thing to talk about

36
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,500
is the system that you be working with
which is

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,240
human brain basic functions as the
central processing system

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,930
love the whole never system and is the
most complex and powerful computer known

39
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,120
but even with an impressive resume

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,610
it still has a number notable issues

41
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,880
it's actually somewhat slow

42
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,100
compensating for that with massive power
of mom parallelism

43
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,100
and %uh as a wide number

44
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,420
malfunctions that can be there do the
born with or you develop this

45
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,120
as with aged and

46
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,610
was a particular interest is that the
brain is the result

47
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,830
newer structures being built on top of
all the ones in the

48
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:45,130
relatively random process so the
pollution and just like certain

49
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,310
operating systems

50
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,840
not really naming any names and ahh

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,170
other assistance for that matter when
built

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,930
up in such a manner have a number issues
and bugs with some

53
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,620
can arise and if you look hard enough
you just might find certain ways to

54
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,319
circumvent

55
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,010
the system securities and

56
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,700
gain access to one of its systems which
have

57
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,630
a weaker in the case the human brain

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,728
this can't be good so

59
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:23,789
let's start by looking at 10 most
classic forms have influenced

60
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:28,449
hypnosis

61
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,259
we've all heard about it but I'm not
talking about that

62
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:37,690
stage stuff generally when you hear
about hypnosis you hear about being

63
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,490
described as a sleep light state

64
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,669
where the prynce state where the person
is in a more %uh suggestible

65
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,190
upstate than usual however

66
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,759
there many times and have different
depths but no matter what kind most

67
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,599
important

68
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,150
pieces that equation is what's known as
the critical factor

69
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,710
have no sacks it can be defined as
bypassing the critical factor

70
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,770
up the conscious mind followed by a
selected acceptable

71
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:08,320
suggestion the critical factor is the
protection

72
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,540
I'll for the mind basically deciding
what should or should not

73
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,680
be believed in short it's a trust level

74
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,870
or permission level if you will

75
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,190
and there are which basically the

76
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:28,419
is someone taking what they're hearing
with a grain of salt

77
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:32,490
throwing it all out the window or
absorbing everywhere they hear

78
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,070
the stock to varies depending on number
variables for instance

79
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,380
if you are

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,669
if somebody's came up to you on the
train

81
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:46,120
you would not be very likely to believe
them anything have to say

82
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,290
but you be less critical I love what
your best friend from kindergarten had

83
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,710
the same

84
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,770
and I'm it gets more complicated than
that

85
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,370
in the fact the it's not just

86
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,699
who says things but what you sent if our
say tomorrow

87
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,550
that the world's men four years most def
I was saying oh boy

88
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,350
similar one of them but if I said the
weather

89
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,389
is gonna be nice tomorrow

90
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,570
you be less likely to arm

91
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,400
not believe what I have to say unless
you heard something directly

92
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,590
contradicting

93
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,760
when I said which illustrates the
varying

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,710
critical factor and since the depths of
Narcissus

95
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,330
our contention on the critical factor
this explains why

96
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,560
the different depths to that and

97
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,699
up that in one sense you could say we're
all

98
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:45,530
already always under some state if it
misses

99
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,040
so the argument not so the amount by
which you decrease someone's critical

100
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,590
factor towards what you say

101
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:56,389
the more influential have over that
person

102
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,949
and since different types of comments
have different missions

103
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:03,919
and acted on them you can use things
that have lower commissions to escalate

104
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,760
your permission

105
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,409
personal level and

106
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,990
won the ways you can do that is simply
speaking

107
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,940
more specifically how you speak their
number things that go into it

108
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:23,940
it's not just reading words together um
compliance dramatic the rules

109
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,360
replace things in a sense as well as
within the entire paragraph

110
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,550
will influence persons perspective

111
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,870
on the phrase and after the context does

112
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,509
tells us how we're supposed to
understand something

113
00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:42,729
that we hear so when anyone speaks
there's a number of qualities about how

114
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,020
they say things

115
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,159
and the tone of voice the inflection Max
and so on

116
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,810
these as well these also moved the
router on the tar sands and the

117
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,020
paragraph

118
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,599
somebody's affect how people how person
speaks mom

119
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,870
sorry I just

120
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,030
somebody's a fax how I a person speaks
are obvious for instance

121
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:14,300
if a professor with the monotone voice

122
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,030
were speaking from the classic pipe that
was classed sleep mom

123
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:22,080
I've come to that however

124
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,650
they're also lotsa less obvious no no
sacks done right

125
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,380
you can draw emphasis two words or
phrases

126
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,759
and take a 10 or take attention off
particular words

127
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,779
member our minds pic up on lots of
things and

128
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,620
when whether you're conscious other or
not so if you drop assists to

129
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,130
mom particular way for particular words
and carefully place sons

130
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,920
you can make it so they barely notice
the word well still conveying meaning

131
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,680
the that would be interpreted as a the
word was drawn focus

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,089
also carefully choosing words can make
use love

133
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,730
what sometimes called weasel words

134
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,620
by um using words that have come in
meetings as well as other additional

135
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,570
meanings

136
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,529
you can construct a sentence that some
tactically has multiple meanings

137
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,259
or a hidden meeting with them the chosen
her son's

138
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,709
um like a better term but I'm

139
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,819
brain has to go through all these to
figure out

140
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,800
which was the proper one so it still
does run through

141
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,319
into the possibilities and
subconsciously remember them

142
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,719
it's a porno here though that the social
conditions influenced

143
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,920
the various meanings vocal patterns and
phrases

144
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,189
and while many of them do have someone
meanings in various situations

145
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:47,480
you arm would need to learn how to

146
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,850
recognizes personality types

147
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,600
and on the topic personality types there
certain personality qualities

148
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,819
that commonly appear together was to be
grouped into

149
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:03,709
specific person I types or families
cultures subcultures unlikely tonight

150
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,519
freeze dispositions

151
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,699
play an important role in shaping
various personality types

152
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,029
understanding these types let's
understand

153
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,189
a person's perception of things such as
their interpretation

154
00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:21,509
both the patterns and words and phrases
and gestures

155
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:24,730
equally important is understanding any

156
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,309
the personality types and

157
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:33,079
by understanding the moment you can
recognize outward signs

158
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,259
and possibly allowing you to
fingerprints personality

159
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,529
either passively if they give enough
information about themselves

160
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,889
or actively by probing with
inconspicuous comments

161
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:53,550
in a %ah sense you can probe someone to
attempt to discover their OS

162
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:58,420
it's a isn't it's not necessary to have
full fingerprint of a person's

163
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,029
personality

164
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:04,079
you can a easily hack person with only
partial fingerprint

165
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,249
narrowing down personality family that
can reveal another

166
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:11,149
exploitable details about that person
and in today's dan H

167
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,999
even less will do because with things
like MySpace and Facebook and other

168
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:16,689
social

169
00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:21,160
non-network number insights all you need
is one piece of information in your lead

170
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,809
to a whole wealth

171
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:25,059
%uh knowledge about that person when
they tell you everything about

172
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:28,329
themselves

173
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:32,730
less questions and doubts

174
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:37,790
and %uh now this book about personality
types his %uh

175
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,209
look for something about what influences
the personalities as well that

176
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,130
broadcasts

177
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:45,210
the Monarchs or

178
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,200
memes means for short is a concept

179
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,140
concept called so many things sometimes
you may have heard it called salsa jeans

180
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,640
or thought viruses means I thought to be
blocks a social information get

181
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,210
transmitted through social interactions
unconscious

182
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,520
on the unconscious levels it would seem
that means play important role

183
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,079
and making sure that the number society

184
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,910
stick to the general belief survival
around and

185
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,689
and the body language also conveys

186
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:23,080
a number of personal qualities as well
as the person's mood

187
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,040
this too is also not conscious

188
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,079
mom or less conscious and even though
more is known about body language

189
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,700
on in the general knowledge there's
still lots of things that are less well

190
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,890
known for instance

191
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,620
micro expressions maybe it's the know
that

192
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,700
people don't have as much control over
the facial expressions as multiple like

193
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,290
to thank

194
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,930
a lot of times other expressions are
simply being suppressed

195
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,410
within a few fractions and second these
expressions

196
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,280
is micro expressions can actually reveal
something about

197
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,680
with the person trying to hide for
instance if a person is lying

198
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,160
will probably make a macro sprechen and

199
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,060
if you wanna take a still shot camera in
threes

200
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,030
the moment we show that is likely see a
images discussed

201
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,240
on the face and with enough practice
most people can actually

202
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:28,240
see these down you know using cameras so
by looking at these micro expressions

203
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,130
other more common on BART body language
patterns

204
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,490
you're able to pick out some useful
information

205
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,620
an attempt %uh to possibly thinking
person's personality

206
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,630
and body language is not only just the
tool

207
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,640
I love X exploitation but also this

208
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,330
on its cover mean backwards

209
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,640
it's also told exploitation not just
discovered

210
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,480
this number things that you can do that
can slip past the conscious defenses

211
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,890
%uh for instance during conversations
not uncommon to see people

212
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,400
moving their hands when they speak and
that gives you the opportunity

213
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,360
to sneak in gestures that are barely
noticeable unless you're looking for

214
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,630
them

215
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,980
but the subconscious level

216
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,080
did notice and is always recorded

217
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,110
and a

218
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,360
one most things you could talk about
aphids

219
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,600
my gonna yeah anyway wanna most things
like to talk about

220
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,160
after disclosing any definite or
possible security vulnerabilities is to

221
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,650
a

222
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:41,300
I'll mention fact that

223
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,740
this people need to look more into these
kinds of things because

224
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,240
more attention is being drawn to this
and what you look on the internet you

225
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,220
won't see

226
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,000
very much about these topics are you
will see more than you see maybe a

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,040
five years ago and you don't want to
have just

228
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,370
few people learning how to a

229
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,610
control some the most intimate details

230
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,970
and

231
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,680
not know how to stop it or as you may
possibly be able to past mine

232
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,710
and the

233
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:27,720
its so

234
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,870
other things to talk about

235
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,380
is that it's anchoring

236
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,760
cannot are when you

237
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,930
are doing anything say you're saying a
certain word you can

238
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,950
make a certain gesture and attach

239
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,900
thats idea

240
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,610
that's conveyed in the words with a
gesture and

241
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,470
to condition the Burton to do it couple
times depending on how

242
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,330
inflexible person as simply making a
gesture will

243
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,950
Tom recall that feeling

244
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,950
or whatever thought it is you would sign
it and I

245
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,730
force now have much to say this a new
niece ask any questions

246
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:24,730
them

247
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,390
%ah that would be arm

248
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:34,790
what I would call the arm my global
exploitation

249
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,370
cuz um with a lot of other drugs your
arm

250
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,200
your axiom imitating chemicals that are
already in your brain

251
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
so it's like taking input

252
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,300
and feeding at the kind of data which it
believes is the proper and legitimate

253
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,860
and in reality it's not

254
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,700
and you can then supply and much larger
quantities than your brain

255
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,329
normally provide causing much more
intense

256
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,250
that and people can use that I love like

257
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,510
you know people trying to find truth
serums and such but as far as I know

258
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,129
that

259
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,709
is very is depending on the person and
not always the most %uh

260
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:24,709
dependable here

261
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,760

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:17,200
posts

551
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,230
%uh mentioned that it's a

552
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,470
said some other stuff that we are all
spots find a

553
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:26,609
they've been a lot of serve as a
possible science studies

554
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:30,230
this the merging about yeah
effectiveness

555
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,810
certain a ritual acts include up

556
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,230
as you want to comment on how do you
know there's an effective

557
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,480
patterns %uh transmission by is

558
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,210
massively destructive also very small

559
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,500
falls I wouldn't comment specifically on
religion

560
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,020
but I would say that their most the
probably are

561
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,400
patterns wish on work that then other
times because

562
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,060
if these are things that are designed it
was speaking then

563
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,910
sign in one case I'll send us pro for

564
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:05,029
nation transit across and organizations

565
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,550
me use that happens it's on us

566
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:13,400
you I miss how on this understanding the
causes most if the

567
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,790
conflicts in the world and do you think
that

568
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:20,070
getting the information out there about
the about are attractions

569
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:24,040
a little think that that people don't
usually know this

570
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,690
you feel like the seventies dollars you
see that Casey that

571
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,740
acting like thank the whole wall you can
almost

572
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:36,450
certain negative things coming from you
go

573
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,730
but mom as I said before

574
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,750
my me

575
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,520
you want to eliminate possible matches

576
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,099
and area slurs use it

577
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:53,240
to you that for that those issues
whether it be

578
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,210
and also this is also not a %uh
information knowledge

579
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,850
and I don't think that

580
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,299
any up dangers

581
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,810
which me possibly happen now

582
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:14,940
way bus into this

583
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,770
ups

584
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,340
so a couple people mention a couple
things actually were

585
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,580
what movies updates sometimes the

586
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,360
the fun brain

587
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,349
it actually gotten UK to serve

588
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:32,549
should on and Jim

589
00:40:32,549 --> 00:40:35,910
comment about which is the structure is
ons

590
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,220
work that was done on which is fireman's
I'll

591
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,290
and especially online country

592
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:45,339
of the battle for your mind by gaming
sup

593
00:40:45,339 --> 00:40:48,619
any action talks about his research is
false he said

594
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:51,750
this it's also this research is well
someone else research

595
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,700
in with

596
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,140
which is served

597
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,990
how that its people services mine should
consider it done

598
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:01,430
certain simple sentences conscious

599
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,470
so a lot of these things are also it
might

600
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,900
as a pocket science church and its

well medium did speaking of that earlier

640
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,080
down that mean song about the

641
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,920

664
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:27,259
round understanding that with that
wasn't

665
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:33,730
run some work

666
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,500
in a good example tired

667
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,540
like that can affect people on

668
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:41,690
from this try this on yourself excuse
but

669
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,700
but somehow try and find a pattern like
that

670
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,900
looks like care boots and see

671
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,190
see how that affects and think about how
that might affect your friends

we look for houses see shapes that

677
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:11,809
aren't really there and by the fact that
our

678
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:15,160
mind does that we are all

679
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,759

680
00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:22,190
