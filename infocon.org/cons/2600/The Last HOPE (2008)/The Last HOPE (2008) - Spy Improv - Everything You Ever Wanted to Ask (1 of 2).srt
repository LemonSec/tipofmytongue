he was appointed as assistant deputy
director national telecoms for

with this book was get out of the way of
the editor

just get out of his way and i did and

154

celery shepherds the mines

214
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,439
changes that used to take ten thousand
years now take three

215
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,820
capitalism we continue to loot the earth

on

223
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,770
you'll know what rendition means right

224
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:19,000
that's kidnapping people off the streets
and exporting them for torture

225
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,960
keep positive trends

226
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:24,120
wealth of networks

fortune at the bottom of the peer mentor

228

and i can talk about these when i want
you to ask the question screen mind

229
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,060
moral capitalism democratic information

230
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,180
of information asymmetry is how we have
been ruled by secrecy

231
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,790
and that's now and a

232
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:43,150
it's not there yet but it's an left hand
of god peer to peer peoplepower i love

233
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,980
this new peer to peer college loans
that's possible

234
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,809
on

235
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:50,770
that's the future

236
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,760
neither candidate will do

237
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,810
all bomber is a slick line mother fucker

238
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,020
costly group

239
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,230
uh... no different than colin powell
except the colin powell has substance

240
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:11,250
and if i were mccain and i were elected
i would ask colin powell back as

241
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:14,320
secretary of state icici org vice
president but

242
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,240
at sixty two and a grievous time

243
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,350
on

244
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,030
most of these well-meaning guys that
betrayed us in the run-up to the war in

245
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,270
iraq nine hundred and thirty-five
documented lies

246
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,910
twenty-five documented high crimes and
misdemeanors by dick cheney

247
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,650
our general officers

248
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:35,150
lost sight of the fact that they wrote
this to protect the constitution of the

249
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,449
chain of command

250
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,409
on

251
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:38,970
these people a bullet

252
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,740
i mention sexyshezz at kickball
wolfowitz down the steps of capitol hill

253
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,940
when he told congress that uh...
junction seki doesn't know he's

254
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,940
committed what he's doing this is uh...
this is going to be you know flowers on

255
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,700
the street war will pay for itself and
so forth

256
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,190
but obama specifically comes from the
south side of chicago which makes

257
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,040
tammany hall looks like

258
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,110
cinderella

259
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,750
on

260
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,340
and he has been very corrupt and he also
is a liar

261
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,910
on he was racism muscle and so on and so
forth now john mccain god bless them

262
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:17,250
for all of the honorable things if he's
done he ended up having to buy a day

263
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,980
and let george bush win and george bush
did when actually i mean he stole the

264
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,920
election for workout or lost as balls

265
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,620
and he uh... then um... are stolen again
in ohio

266
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,240
where the republican secretary of state
for all the good machines in the rich

267
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,220
districts that loves bush or in the
districts in love with him he had

268
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,780
uh... people of color standing for seven
hours

269
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,480
inline to vote

270
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,490
and in some audits they found that all
votes for carey for some reason weren't

271
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,900
even count it all

272
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:49,470
not that i would have liked carrie i
think in in retrospect

273
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,950
bush cheney is a lot better than cary

274
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,300
on because the devil is a lot better
than the placebo

275
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,110
or when you're up against it

276
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:02,519
bloomberg will probably not run for
president although he still

277
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,959
holding is his cards close to his chest

278
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,260
but he'd be in eighty eight to run for
president plus he can do what i do

279
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,380
alm

280
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,160
he simply doesn't read enough

281
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,930
on soul somewhere in here we need to get

282
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:21,460
on somebody like me not necessarily mean
when i say me i mean e is a as a uh...

283
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,630
stand-in for we the people that this
wisdom of the crowds the common sense of

284
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,600
everybody

285
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,100
these two clouds have no idea what
they're doing

286
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,530
they just working with these stupid
little policies sound bites none of

287
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,689
which are backed up by a balanced budget

288
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,580
alm therefore reforms of this nation
needs

289
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,540
we need intelligence reform which means
we need to get public intelligence in

290
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,490
the public interest and stop going with
the default to secrecy

291
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,060
we need national security reform which
is four for a lot

292
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,930
cheaper to wage peace educate all thomas
jefferson said the nation's great

293
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:57,720
difficult best defense is an educated
citizenry

294
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,990
well all across this nation we have this
little fiefdoms

295
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,000
where the guys in the city council in
the uh... rotary spoiled and so forth

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,030
cell public land on public airwaves and
public privileges in public tax

297
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,230
exemptions

298
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,740
to corporations

299
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,330
and at the same time don't invest in
education and welfare and health

300
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,890
so that they are an essential creating
perpetual generations of slaves

301
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,660
white slaves brown slaves or cali slaves

302
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,020
we need a nonpartisan reality based
budget

303
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,098
all i can eliminate medicare

304
00:15:30,099 --> 00:15:37,099
unfunded deficiencies overnight just by
eliminating the legislatively mandated

305
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,590
uh... proscription that means for
bidding

306
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,600
of government to go see a show with
performance

307
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:47,670
and finally we need to demand electoral
reform and just very quickly on that

308
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:51,640
and all nbsp repaired remarks in about
five minutes

309
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,340
this is not rocket science

310
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,740
the poor who rely on buses and cannot
afford to miss work will generally not

311
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,520
be able to vote on a tuesday

312
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,770
this whole system is designed to keep
the poor from voting

313
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,910
as part of gerrymandering

314
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,689
honest open debate

315
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:15,430
the league of women voters was fired
from the debate business

316
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:18,970
because they did to suggest that we
should that they should be able to ask

317
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,180
questions

318
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,200
that were not provided to the candidates
in advance

319
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,890
and they dared to suggest that they
should be allowed to bring in third

320
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,880
fourth and fifth parties

321
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,250
so the republican and democratic parties
both of which are intensely corrupt and

322
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,030
a mirror

323
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,000
of one another

324
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,740
are basically said okay we're to create
a presidential debate commission so we

325
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,870
can keep a monopoly

326
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,040
on a presidential debate insists this is
terribly terribly wrong

327
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,640
filing cabinet level debates

328
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,480
america's too complicated to be run by
one white and one half white man and his

329
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,470
cronies

330
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,170
on

331
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,490
we need to demand

332
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,490
that they appoint justice state and
defense

333
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,620
and that these people participate in and
uh... the dates and have a balanced

334
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,390
budget

335
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,210
well uh... that they talk about

336
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:11,650
i'm now the intelligence officer for
reuniting american the citizens summit

337
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,579
and our goal is to have a people's
cabinet and a balanced budget

338
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,200
on put in place for the first of october
i hope

339
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,260
on and challenge these two plans

340
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,079
onto

341
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,399
match what we the people can do by
ourselves

342
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,120
just using open source is in common
sense

343
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,289
and finally an instant runoff

344
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,850
and many of these ideas are ralph
nader's book

345
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:40,039
ralph ralph is is a spoiler because he
doesn't play well with others

346
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,990
uh...

347
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,100
and and uh... that's unfortunate and

348
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,410
i really like uh... ron paul i really
liked anna's senecas the only guy short

349
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,560
enough to be

350
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:55,360
qualified to be vice president to obama

351
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,520
and then finally parted november two
thousand and nine

352
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,110
full imbalance representation i mean in
every any given state all of the

353
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,930
libertarian should be counted as a
libertarian block

354
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,059
and then tightly drawn districts

355
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:11,210
in those instances where there is no
libertarian resident can have one

356
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,070
imported

357
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,960
but the whole idea here is that on one
hand you count the full spectrum of

358
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,220
political parties across the state

359
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:22,210
you and the winner take all system in
parle and in the state

360
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,160
legislatures wilson national

361
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,400
all and then finally full public funding
of diverse candidates we do have to get

362
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,540
the money out

363
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:32,408
at least two ways to get the money out

364
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:36,280
way number one as the legislative gas
that way number two is to outspend them

365
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,530
and you'll see

366
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,770
a spot maybe you won't see a slight on
that it's in my other brief

367
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,290
let's do the math the republicans to get
out early nineteen eighties that they

368
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,129
can buy the entire u_s_ government from
school house the white house for three

369
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,630
hundred million dollars per year

370
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,230
and that's the plan they executed that's
the plan to give us newt gingrich

371
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,799
intel

372
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,059
in that contract with america

373
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:02,120
on

374
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,440
self five hundred million dollars

375
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,940
divided by twenty five million citizens
out of two hundred million

376
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,250
that's one hundred million

377
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,050
or a hundred dollars

378
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,530
line five million citizens that's five
hundred million

379
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:22,320
where we have failed is we have failed
to create a political action committee

380
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,129
for we the people

381
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:30,450
we have a ceo you know we have all these
little in olney issue groups fragmented

382
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,590
we failed to put three a political
action committee for we the people

383
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,540
on and finally no legislation or budget
allocation without prior notification

384
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,680
now this is reality

385
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,030
we're spending in the united states

386
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:52,600
counting the supplemental seven fifteen
a hundred billion a year on waging war

387
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:58,020
and the rest of the world combined with
us tolls one point three trillion

388
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,430
five biggest offenders with respect to
the proliferation of nuclear chemical

389
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:06,340
biological weapons as well as small arms
are the five members of the five

390
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,820
permanent members of the security
council

391
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,730
united states sells five times more
weapons than russia does

392
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:15,820
and three times more in the united
kingdom does

393
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,250
on china's virtually inconsequential
because china is waging peace i hope you

394
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,660
asked me about that

395
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,020
china's kicking our asses both
information warfare electronic warfare

396
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,000
and waging peace

397
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,920
there's three trillion dollars a year

398
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,690
being spent around the world ported

399
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,440
on

400
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,020
war on tax-exempt nonprofits which are
not really giving to all the just to

401
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,470
cover for action

402
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,860
on

403
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,450
if you read confessions of an economic
hit man it's great to have these quasi

404
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,160
religious groups it goin

405
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,500
and give the native stuff tickets and
diarrhea so they'll move off the

406
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,870
mountain with the gold

407
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,309
on

408
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:56,670
if there's an amazing synergy of crime
between the vatican the mafia

409
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,730
organized crime oversees u_s_
corporations the u_s_ government and

410
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,530
selected elements of other foreign
governments

411
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,230
we don't lack for money

412
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,350
we lack for honest informed decision
making

413
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,100
so hard deal

414
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,460
if we the people were to become
mobilized

415
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,289
is they have senators obama

416
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,840
and mccain

417
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,809
if you really want to be qualified to
run for president

418
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:26,180
to be collected had to be elected
president in a why are you as a member

419
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,310
of the senate not introducing electoral
reform which is the most fundamental

420
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,550
restoration of the rights of the
individual citizens in america

421
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,430
why are you not willing to announce at
least three cabinet positions wire

422
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:43,799
you're not willing to post a balanced
budget online by one october

423
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:47,220
on why are you not willing to
acknowledge that ten high-level threats

424
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,480
to humanity identified the lieutenant
general brent scowcroft and the other

425
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
members of the high-level threat panel

426
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,399
why are you not willing to recognize
that there are twelve

427
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:59,540
policies from agriculture

428
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,730
through water that must be managed as a
whole

429
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:06,759
it makes no sense to use water we don't
have to grow brain we don't need

430
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:11,960
to create ethanol which uses a thousand
four hundred liters of water per gallon

431
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,649
to create

432
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:15,679
this is not rocket science

433
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,160
okay and i will by the way tell you the
washington to everything and he is now

434
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,590
in nineteen seventy five to seventy nine

435
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,059
with senate hearings on people and so
forth and they basically decided

436
00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:28,000
to pass the buck for work

437
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,970
and so the reason we're being screwed
over today is because they decided to

438
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,940
keep the uh... money coming from exxon
and others

439
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,000
into to keep the the pearls happy with
with cheap gas

440
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
exxon did not

441
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,410
forty billion dollars in profit this
year

442
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:47,270
for every gallon of gas for which we pay
four dollars exxon externalizing twelve

443
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,440
dollars and costs

444
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,760
to the climate of the planet to future
generations

445
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:59,260
so basically exide is being allowed to
steal from the future

446
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,840
are being allowed to destroying the
planet and not be held accountable for

447
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,699
it

448
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,340
and finally technology urgency burners
game because nothing we do matters

449
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,899
unless we create something to brazil
china india indonesia

450
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:14,150
iran russia venezuelan while parts like
the congo

451
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,539
in any way

452
00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:19,510
now i don't think i want to spend too
much time on this i just want you to

453
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,169
know that they're there

454
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,580
all four each of the ten threats i have
a slide that describes the nature of the

455
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,510
threat

456
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,250
on

457
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,040
very very simple other atrocities
child's labor child prostitution by name

458
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,230
kidnap and murder for body parts

459
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,410
and so forth

460
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,240
free to the policy system really basic
things that we can do it in the economy

461
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,310
and c_e_o_ greed ten dollar minimum wage
full employment local supply chain

462
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,840
on education

463
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,500
justice pardo marijuana offenders we've
created a prison system based on

464
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,559
marijuana

465
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:56,540
on wind down a prison slave complex
eliminate corporate personality

466
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,159
on a challengers

467
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,880
all very very serious

468
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,309
and finally therefore methods balanced
budget

469
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,290
uh... sustainable designers came true
cost

470
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,010
i see that they coming when you can
point your hand held at a bar code and

471
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,340
it will tell you

472
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:15,889
in detail whether or not that meets your
social values and how much water is a

473
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,970
man how much workshop labor how much tax
avoidance

474
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:22,190
and so forth ultimately i believe that
by cots

475
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,040
on

476
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,379
and citizen action says in decision
making will in fact change the

477
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,360

00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:12,450
barred no bullshit q and a

490
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,289
is there a question

491
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:17,658
smooth brotherhood

492
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:22,120
uh... this is one o go ahead

493
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,070
after hasn't left goes then right

494
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,050
all right

495
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:26,990
um...

496
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:31,590
he's actually to write you know but i'm
manipulate habbo about that

497
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,630
win uh... do you think the united states
will ever moved to a

498
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,870
honest money system in other words
government money

499
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,449
versus corporation money

500
00:25:40,449 --> 00:25:44,780
which funds all the bullshit that he get
that's that's a great great question

501
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,110
i mean you most people don't realize
that the federal reserve is not part of

502
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,550
the federal government

503
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,240
the federal reserve is a front for the
central banks

504
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,100
and both into jackson and abraham
lincoln were assassinated conveniently

505
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,220
when they were about to start and john
f_ kennedy interjection lincoln kennedy

506
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,610
were assassinated

507
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,610
when both were thinking about going
precisely in that direction

508
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,900
the constitution calls for the u_s_
government to be able to print money

509
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,760
with the full faith and credit of the
american people

510
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,440
and we managed to avoid this central
bank bullshit until about nineteen

511
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,850
thirty five

512
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:25,180
on when we got sucked into it and then
of course a civil war was funded by

513
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,630
europe on both sides as part of creating
this landing debt cycle

514
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,200
of what the government

515
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,419
on i think it's not going to happen
until we the people

516
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:39,570
on thier very very angry

517
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:44,540
and and demanded of of our candidates as
we had an effect you know when i say the

518
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:47,270
candidates are relevant what i mean by
that

519
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:51,549
is all candidates have been a relevant
up to this point in in large part

520
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:54,760
because even a totally honest
congressman by the time he gets the

521
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,100
washington he learns to things the first
thing he learns is that he's got a

522
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,779
campaign every day for money

523
00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:02,409
and only corporations will give the
money under under these circumstances

524
00:27:02,409 --> 00:27:04,039
and to

525
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,379
there's something called party-line
corruption

526
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,490
which is that if you don't vote the
party line in congress you don't get the

527
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:11,700
nice office in the extra staff

528
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,910
laws and so we've really undermined our
democracy considerably by the manner in

529
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,320
which we doubled bennett so-called
representation democracy

530
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,909
the other thing that's happening apart
from the fact that we need to kill the

531
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,070
central bank and uh... and get rid of
the whole concept of boring if it were

532
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,080
me i just default on the loans

533
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,740
on sorry bout that truong

534
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,520
misunderstanding um... they stroll along
the way what's at yet exactly well not

535
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,510
not only a baseball that all the
ultimate cold call which might rupert

536
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:47,030
talks about it crosses aerobic on the
chairman of the s_e_c_

537
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,379
had the balls to go down to columbia
could set a meeting up with the farken

538
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,679
say would you please investor drug

539
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,460
the liquidity with us

540
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,910
on wall street

541
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,670
visit documented track this guy

542
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,880
okay i mean

543
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
brazen

544
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,290
uh...

545
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:06,320
uh... which she got it myron away uh...
actually afghanistan which under the

546
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,720
u_s_ has gone from zero to eighty
percent of all heroin production the

547
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,900
united states

548
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,720
what happens is that on the u_s_
direction

549
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,670
now the afghan poppy is going to
pakistan

550
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:20,710
where general moshe refs uh... factories
turn it in a number four harrowing

551
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:21,740
on

552
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,020
we've basically made drug money of the
liquidity the wall street needs

553
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,080
phone

554
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,810
and you don't hear anybody talking about
the client and drug stocks

555
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,470
uh... they're they're doing just fine

556
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,030
along

557
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,310
the other side of money is open money

558
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,700
insider if you look at that

559
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,830
what's happening now is that we're
moving more more toward a barber connie

560
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,250
in many places

561
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,430
and there are a number of wonderful
books but one of them in particular that

562
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,950
i recollect is um... is called off the
books

563
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:55,360
the urban economy

564
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,580
and it's were really poor people live a
life of dignity by trading home-cooked

565
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,418
meals for car repairs and things like
that it's an off the books coming

566
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,980
on our money system right now is
completely dysfunctional it's fraudulent

567
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,050
it's fraudulent because it's not tied
the value of the reason we're having a

568
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:15,460
stock precious because we allow
derivatives the doughnuts

569
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,710
instead of foreign money on a house and
it was there was a direct relationship

570
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,960
between alone in the house

571
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,020
we allow people to start hedging
indirectly in all this stuff and and

572
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,680
it's it's it's terrible

573
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,910
so long to short answer is

574
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,430
we were sucked into making a huge
mistake because we the people took a

575
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,860
ride off the ball

576
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,630
we allowed our government to
misrepresent us

577
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,260
and now

578
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,769
bless the internet

579
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:43,000
of old is a book called the future of
the internet and how to stop it

580
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:43,799
on

581
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,500
you know i'm very very concerned about
the air remedies tethered devices and

582
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,310
and uh... so forth which is one reason i
don't know

583
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:53,220
and iphone

584
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,750
uh... we we need to break the backs of
all these tether devices which is where

585
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,910
hackers come in

586
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:00,520
on does that answer your question

587
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,079
somewhat um... it's it's all up

588
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:06,570
that that well really exited stage and
we've got four hours

589
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:09,070
particularly alright

590
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:12,620
have you how don't know if you've
already uh... um... and excellent

591
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,140
reference creature from jekyll island

592
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,480
no i have not noah has a most publishers
are feeling tight retaliated created

593
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,540
some publishing company but it's gone

594
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,430
tons of excellent references in it shows
of course as you mentioned

595
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,610
how dishonest our money system is

596
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:31,810
and how impoverish is of course the
entire american populist

597
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,620
uh... for the behest of these uh...
discussed you know that you're right i

598
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,570
mean it's really a full cultural shift
is ruled by scarcity ruled by secrecy in

599
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,050
a

600
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,370
in an abundance society it's a gift
economy

601
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,470
in your prestige as in the hackers world
as in the open source for comes from

602
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,570
what you've given up what you think

603
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,408
on

604
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:52,260
would you encourage uh...

605
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,170
people

606
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:59,140
then uh... not following the sixteen th
amendment was never ratified

607
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,790
with the sixteen th amendment

608
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,000
income tax which is illegal and
unconstitutional

609
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,159
off

610
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:10,039
according to article one section to nine
way this is a risk there's a lot to be

611
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,470
said for that there's also a lot to be
said for the twenty seven secessionist

612
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,950
movements of the system and you know
that there were twenty seven

613
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,770
secessionist movements

614
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:21,350
okay having vermont being the strongest
and most reasonable

615
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,090
on and then you've got organ

616
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,380
and so forth

617
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,179
palm

618
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:32,730
and right unfortunately were trapped in
a terminal system and i mean for example

619
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,530
the right to bear arms is a fundamental
right

620
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,889
and and this may sound learning but

621
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,240
i take i take uh... my right to bear
arms uh... my most recent illustration

622
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,669
was in the patriot

623
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,650
where the kid what sent to the uh...
into the church she says will calling up

624
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,140
to malaysia

625
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,220
and they basically grab their guns in
doubt

626
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,380
you know where he got their uniforms

627
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,990
uh... they're not part of the national
guard in a partisan structured organized

628
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:02,399
militia their citizens with guns in an
attitude

629
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,340
okay

630
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,820
well that's the malicious

631
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,360
palm and unfortunately we've allowed
ourselves to give up that right

632
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,750
to bear arms at the same time that we've
allowed ourselves to give up

633
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,269
or right to printer on money and not be
indebted to banks in europe and actually

634
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,100
australia also now

635
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,690
on and uh... finally

636
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:27,750
we've given up our right to demand that
income tax uh... not be applied

637
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:32,020
and even worse than income taxes how the
money is spent i mean davy crockett was

638
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,270
lectured by guy who said it's not your
money to give

639
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,379
when davy crockett approve this twenty
thousand dollars gift or whatever

640
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,690
uh... right now we have a congress that
is wasting

641
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,080
wasting

642
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,230
two-thirds

643
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:50,130
of the money that we pay

644
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,549
on and i think

645
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:54,620
the kind of comes along about answer
your question where you have to stop

646
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,330
there whether you like it or not

647
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,400
bomb

648
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,299
is

649
00:32:58,299 --> 00:32:59,889
transparency

650
00:32:59,889 --> 00:33:01,889
is going to be the key here

651
00:33:01,889 --> 00:33:03,460
true costs

652
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,300
and eliminate

653
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,100
for example in every small town across
america like to see a little hacker

654
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,470
seller a little celeb independence of
the some of them

655
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,440
who basically every time a deal was cut
with a corporation bail on the nato got

656
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,470
what when where

657
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,660
okay and that's why i like

658
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,850
all this stuff

659
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,070
and and you guys can do

660
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,000
yes

661
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,080
now coming over here sir

662
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,720
i was just wondering if you'd heard
about uh... some of the new were uh...

663
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,720
early voting on such as the one in uh...
tennessee which allows

664
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,980
the citizenry to

665
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:42,200
before an election and so x minus ten
days before an election

666
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,390
uh... also other states have certain
provisions for uh...

667
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,179
absentee voting before it happens for

668
00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:52,430
pretty loose reasons i know in kentucky
where i'm from

669
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,240
you don't have to prove a reason that
you're gonna be out you're just gonna

670
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,809
use distance a

671
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:59,670
i'll be on vacation in the hand your
ballot

672
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:04,430
so do you do you know about uh... news
and now i i i am balance on balance i

673
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:09,099
favor flexibility i don't favor
electronics obviously

674
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:10,849
on

675
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:15,279
and and i think actors have rented a
real service and in hacking be bold i

676
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:18,369
mean this is a guy who stood up at a
republican fundraiser prior two thousand

677
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:19,739
and four

678
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,610
said i died at the next

679
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:22,529
president

680
00:34:22,529 --> 00:34:25,509
i'm gonna deliver this election to you

681
00:34:25,509 --> 00:34:27,208
do

682
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:28,199
mom

683
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,210
you know at in and they're documented
cases

684
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,679
now on balance i think of anything that
makes it possible to vote but at the

685
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,098
same time

686
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:42,009
there is this relationship between
voting in education and civic duty and

687
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:45,519
all of these other things that we will
look at your feet is a guy named online

688
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,709
home than any book i've mentioned
generally have reviewed it and you have

689
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,668
to buy into st my review

690
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:51,728
alm

691
00:34:51,729 --> 00:34:53,679
but there's a book

692
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,999
has a book by lionel tiger called the
manufacture of evil

693
00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:00,960
and one of the things he talks about is
how the industrial europe broke the

694
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,109
connection of kinship

695
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:05,140
it broke the trust connection

696
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,609
between people in cottage industries
heat local home rule all that stuff

697
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,288
and people became come out of time ste

698
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,959
they became a good

699
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:17,529
and that's why globalization is so bad
because free trade is completely

700
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:19,369
different from fair trade

701
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,759
i mean fair trade is minimum wage is
everywhere

702
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:26,059
welfare labor standards the whole nine
yards

703
00:35:26,059 --> 00:35:30,139
free trade is fucked the american people
were going to go for the lowest common

704
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:33,319
cost and we're not gonna count the cost
of oil

705
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:36,460
for bringing a three dollar piece of
crap from china to sell

706
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,769
uh... for six dollars by wal-mart

707
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,509
on so you've got some real issues there

708
00:35:42,509 --> 00:35:44,339
voting is part of it

709
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:49,719
we have to mobilize we have to we have
to really get pissed off

710
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,419
and it may take another three to seven
years that may take till twenty twelve

711
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:56,049
but i am hoping

712
00:35:56,049 --> 00:36:00,459
that this next administration will be
the first administration

713
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:04,759
in which the president is forced to
listen to reunite in america

714
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,410
and other similar aggregate groups
reuniting american consists of the

715
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:11,609
leadership

716
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:16,420
bcl you all the way to norquist's uh...
americans for tax reform who won

717
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,660
love and admire

718
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,730
very much

719
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,739
on

720
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:25,469
and so i think this maybe then this next
administration is the first one

721
00:36:25,469 --> 00:36:28,930
in which we could reasonably plausibly

722
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,198
be in the face of the administration
irrespective of what c_n_n_ does it does

723
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:34,309
not do

724
00:36:34,309 --> 00:36:38,199
i mean i i'm gift that i am i'm able to
get the fax number of the personal

725
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:40,700
system to the top guy just about
anywhere

726
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,769
arm

727
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:45,879
and so i got straight through to the
c_n_n_ presents a local jobs is a nice

728
00:36:45,879 --> 00:36:48,819
guy but he's loosely educated he'd rules

729
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,749
or

730
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,959
and and he only has one or two issues
here why don't you have him on why this

731
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:56,019
is c_n_n_ sponsor

732
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:59,869
a one-day summit of the top experts on
each of the threats each of the policy

733
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:00,829
so on

734
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,510
videotape the whole thing

735
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,400
and then to a one c our special and
which there are video cameos

736
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,810
of those people who shined during this
one-hour summit while you in the next

737
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,739
thirty five weeks educate america what
the substances

738
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:18,499
and he didn't listen but lou dobbs has
taken a remarkable turn recently told

739
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:20,610
word actually talking about more than

740
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,059
more than immigration

741
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:23,169
on

742
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:28,279
you know immigration i_d_ i myself come
mon descended from the seventeenth

743
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:32,069
century spanish revolutionaries and
apple on a number for generation

744
00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:33,970
colombian on my mother's side

745
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,279
on

746
00:37:35,279 --> 00:37:39,239
you don't solve immigration by building
walls to solve immigration by keeping

747
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,180
everybody else where they are

748
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,058
by giving them a good quality life there

749
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:50,349
okay this is not rocket science

750
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:52,989
mother thought

751
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:57,939
in any event we we really need to do
much much better at at mobilizing the

752
00:37:57,939 --> 00:38:02,259
folks so voting as part of it but if you
case in his as much a part of it is

753
00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:04,929
anything and that's what we've really
fallen down

754
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:08,549
uh... it's now established that
graduating from college is not going to

755
00:38:08,549 --> 00:38:10,869
be guarantee of white-collar wages

756
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,809
uh... and in fact my oldest son who are
brought here two years ago

757
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:19,369
are dropped out of college because he
refused to take algebra second time

758
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:23,119
uh... and he chose to not come this year
because he wanted to continue making

759
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:24,069
music

760
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:27,589
on he is probably as smart

761
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:28,779
as articulate

762
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,849
as thoughtful and maybe ten times saner

763
00:38:31,849 --> 00:38:34,029
than any every college graduate

764
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:36,109
law as are many of you

765
00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:39,959
uh... many of you dropped out of a high
school or college and went on i mean

766
00:38:39,959 --> 00:38:44,430
rich installment whom i admire very very
much sets the gold standard

767
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,140
for what it drop out to do for good bill
gates sets the gold standard for the

768
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,799
dropout can do for batch

769
00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:52,139
it also

770
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:55,649
in fact i don't think i have it here
decided in another slide you don't get

771
00:38:55,649 --> 00:39:00,449
seven open-source software is communist
well if that's the case

772
00:39:00,449 --> 00:39:07,359
and microsoft this fascist

773
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:11,400
right now the question is if i make test
make closing a statement

774
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,979
the allies not the articulate was a
statement the time

775
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:22,339
not only is it because the education i
think very important as far as being a

776
00:39:22,339 --> 00:39:25,558
you know getting people involved simply
put week we need to break down the

777
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:26,880
barriers that say

778
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,730
you can talk about politics can talk
about religion because these two things

779
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,529
are such close

780
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:35,559
those systems is they are right now

781
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:39,299
mainly because there's the stigma
against the you know discussing them in

782
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:43,538
and in an open setting and if we break
down those those things i think the evil

783
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:44,629
an hour

784
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:47,859
you're you're right and and and as we
start weeding out the people that don't

785
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:51,759
want to gage in this dialogue maybe we
can open it up to more interaction and

786
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:54,819
bring the lights up and hold hands and
sing combo and just kidding

787
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:57,150
but now i think we should have more
interaction

788
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,489
also anchorage and i'm glad to have your
comment

789
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,189
part of the problem

790
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:03,169

798
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:31,929
are you realize it's like read that book
that

799
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:36,959
that the entire body of knowledge for
the people that day

800
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,069
sleek

801
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,299
okay julie thought when they sober

802
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,839
and shoot

803
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,558
comes from talk radio

804
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:47,889
listened to while they're working at
their shit jobs

805
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:48,959
okay

806
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:52,408
and unfortunately what we've created
this this whole mass of people whose

807
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:55,819
entire understanding the world comes
from the pat robertson seven hundred

808
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:56,829
cloth

809
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:57,619
you know

810
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:00,720
or these other things i mean they have
no clue m

811
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,449
and and they then resort to america
right or wrong

812
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:08,640
well i'm sorry but not ten times it's
been american eileen wrong but really

813
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,999
fucked up wrong

814
00:41:09,999 --> 00:41:13,209
okay and and i say that as a patriot

815
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:16,828
nelson and the johnson seventeen
something last refuge of a scandalous

816
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:17,899
patriotism

817
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:20,990
when people tell you you can't he'll
speak ill get

818
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,260
you know i i was one of them lumber
people it's hard to find hundred

819
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,069
thousand dollar ads against the iraq war

820
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:30,999
and the newspapers refuse the money and
with advertising in newspapers it has to

821
00:41:30,999 --> 00:41:33,169
be cash on the table in advance

822
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:35,118
because they know you want him later

823
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,239
along

824
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,380
and uh... it's just astonishing the way
this country said we're not gonna listen

825
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,629
any alternative opinions

826
00:41:42,629 --> 00:41:46,779
it's america right or wrong we're going
to go takeover rocked and never mind the

827
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:48,049
consequences

828
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:52,889
on so it's all a big star so we'll come
back we can have a dialogue i'll be here

829
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:55,730
for four hours so i plan to stop in
forest

830
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,329
out of respect for those people who were
on

831
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,489
you start speaking attend tomorrow

832
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:02,829
bowman surely seventy one here

833
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:05,419
ourself

834
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:07,709
over here

835
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:12,359
uh... so i'm on the topic of fascism
communism what were you saying about

836
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,269
china

837
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:16,989
where you want me to say that right

838
00:42:16,989 --> 00:42:18,519
i don't know that i

839
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,769
understood you

840
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:21,339
okay china

841
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:26,449
graduating more honor students from high
school every year

842
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:30,719
did we graduate from high school all the
way down to the ship high schools at the

843
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,419
social promotion

844
00:42:33,419 --> 00:42:35,558
what does that tell you about where
they're gone

845
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:40,439
now if you guys looked up on its online
i wrote a wonderful to page memo which

846
00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:44,009
went toward the assistant secretary
defense for special operations u_s_ has

847
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:46,199
something now called irregular warfare

848
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,380
it's called for waging peace

849
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:51,469
somewhere deep in the pentagon they
finally figured out that maybe we need

850
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:56,109
to wage peace as a means of reducing the
chances of are waging war

851
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:58,129
on

852
00:42:58,129 --> 00:43:02,519
the chinese since when chart alan i a m
and money well at all of you got

853
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,769
together in nineteen ninety four

854
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:08,419
the chinese have been focused virtually
exclusively

855
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,019
on developing innovation and electronic
warfare

856
00:43:12,019 --> 00:43:15,839
uh... you know how you can buy uh...
those things that you plug in that that

857
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,519
that's why you can't you can

858
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:19,770
plugin checking your into your

859
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,119
cable modem and then you can plug it
into the wall

860
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:25,889
and then the entire electrical system
becomes kind of a circuit many can plug

861
00:43:25,889 --> 00:43:27,679
another one in on the other and

862
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:28,900
and and put it well

863
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,059
the chinese to figure out how to
penetrate any computer dot connected to

864
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:34,739
the internet that is connected to the
grad

865
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:36,189
this is pretty cool

866
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:39,959
and one of the reasons peterson air
force base is moving all its computers

867
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,799
so it is because they walked into an
underground bunker that was supposedly

868
00:43:43,799 --> 00:43:46,669
completely isolated except it was on the
crew

869
00:43:46,669 --> 00:43:50,368
and there was the chinese equivalent of
fuck you assholes we were here

870
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:51,439
uh...

871
00:43:51,439 --> 00:43:53,899
united stis

872
00:43:53,899 --> 00:43:54,950
i don't know why

873
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,789
caused a little bit

874
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:58,559
no

875
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:00,909
so good thing

876
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:04,649
and if you get this memo when you can
get it very easily by looking for but

877
00:44:04,649 --> 00:44:08,078
trainees irregular warfare lois s dot
net

878
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,509
calm

879
00:44:09,509 --> 00:44:12,369
the trainees are waging peace

880
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:14,420
when they do a trade delegation

881
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:18,469
their president shows up not some
diction assistant secretary who's a

882
00:44:18,469 --> 00:44:21,109
political appointee

883
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:25,369
vault the chinese cultural centers or
five times better than ours

884
00:44:25,369 --> 00:44:28,899
they're offering free chinese lessons
all over the world but particularly in

885
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:30,368
the southern hemisphere

886
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:33,239
although they are exporting man

887
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:37,499
argentina will be majority chinese by
twenty twenty five

888
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:41,339
okay in many areas of africa will be
majority chinese that's an area where

889
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,549
there beating the shit out of the
indians

890
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:47,349
the indians haven't figured out the
whole exporter manhood

891
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:48,459
on

892
00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:51,388
and sold its very very interesting

893
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,999
now how i believe in china

894
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:59,049
art believe that people like uh...
contacted morgan guaranty

895
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:02,788
have done something out so well the
incredible things with the chinese

896
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:05,549
in fact i was watching him on board were

897
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:09,519
year or two ago when he was given a
speech about how he made a helmet he got

898
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:11,349
a really good deal with the chinese

899
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,230
and in this speech he says you know

900
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,960
that i finally got to meet with the
prime minister and

901
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,619
and i said why are you giving us this
business in this is a direct quote from

902
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:23,929
john mack two i don't know personally
but i admire very much

903
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,179
the prime minister is reputed to set
because you're the only delegation came

904
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,929
without a lawyer

905
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,039
that's good

906
00:45:30,039 --> 00:45:31,199
that's very good

907
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,489
and so i think china china is not stupid
china out like toronto arise persians

908
00:45:36,489 --> 00:45:38,229
okay they're not ready yet

909
00:45:38,229 --> 00:45:39,689
their person's

910
00:45:39,689 --> 00:45:42,089
they go back a long way

911
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:47,199
and uh... we need to respect all of this
i think china and recognizes

912
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,809
all of these things

913
00:45:48,809 --> 00:45:52,919
china has grasped the reality of the
need for real time science and the

914
00:45:52,919 --> 00:45:56,439
changes on the planet that used to take
ten thousand years now take three

915
00:45:56,439 --> 00:46:00,569
all i've believes that china is
potentially

916
00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,579
a catalyst eighty-eight critical player
as with india

917
00:46:04,579 --> 00:46:05,410
on

918
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,828
then perhaps a rock

919
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,549
long and certainly russia

920
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:13,199
their potential critical players in
getting it right

921
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,959
or and what we have to do is we have to
spend the next five to seven years

922
00:46:16,959 --> 00:46:22,178
building a model which i've tried to do
with earth intelligence network

923
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,790
at the briefing that you on this keeping
you can

924
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,589
see the slides with the notes that at my
website

925
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:29,788
alm

926
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:33,130
we don't on earth intelligence network
we don't control anything which is

927
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:37,200
putting a mean not they are trying to
put out a in analytic model

928
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,259
all four people to adopt a naked adopted
apply anywhere

929
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,009
so in my view

930
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,159
china is not the enemy

931
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:47,859
china is a potential ally

932
00:46:47,859 --> 00:46:49,769
and if we're lucky

933
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:52,389
they want this missus

934
00:46:52,389 --> 00:46:54,769
every year

935
00:46:54,769 --> 00:46:58,670
uh... i said like you to go back to the
china thing because i don't understand

936
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,799
that uh...

937
00:47:00,799 --> 00:47:03,739
i guess a different understanding of
china

938
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:07,549
did you do so i'd like you to go back
and talk about it some more but i have

939
00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:09,409
uh... a different question

940
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,389
you said

941
00:47:11,389 --> 00:47:15,909
five million people donating a hundred
dollars each

942
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:18,960
has five hundred dollar five a two
million dollars which

943
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,579
speeds what the republicans need to take
over the government each year is a is

944
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,209
that

945
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:27,558
yet more or less

946
00:47:27,559 --> 00:47:30,699
well besides the fact that i uh...
offered you a hundred dollars earlier

947
00:47:30,699 --> 00:47:34,989
then he told me to stop drinking in
china bomb

948
00:47:34,989 --> 00:47:38,359
well you know that's wrong i bought this
guy launch and i'm a recovering

949
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:41,469
alcoholic and he saw going down bloody
marys

950
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:44,099
dislike this little cognitive dissonance
there

951
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,960
uh... especially since some pain

952
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:46,800
uh...

953
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,050
itself by aston not to

954
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,660
flaunt his drunkenness in front of me
not that i don't like drunkenness

955
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,129
especially in making women that don't
have a lot of fat on it

956
00:47:56,129 --> 00:47:59,558
uh... felled sir

957
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,429
it's is valid so bill let's leave all
those precious hours decides to take a

958
00:48:03,429 --> 00:48:07,339
look at it one hundred i want the system
to have a hundred this is about me

959
00:48:07,339 --> 00:48:11,799
this is about us okay going they
wouldn't requested maybe i'm naive uh...

960
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:12,930
it doesn't stop

961
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,790
first off even if it's hard to get five
million people to donate our hundred

962
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,619
dollars it's not we're just not
organized to do it

963
00:48:20,619 --> 00:48:25,729
robert mister steele of it cost twelve
dollars and fifty cents to register a

964
00:48:25,729 --> 00:48:30,839
domain name our call it that people's
political action uh... action committee

965
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:32,049
p p eight c

966
00:48:32,049 --> 00:48:35,700
who's gonna start this halloween like
you know make this move forward

967
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,030
well jim turner

968
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,740
who is ralph nader's second employee has
already created the transport of some

969
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,839
people's trust as a transport of some
people's bank to start taking the money

970
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:51,279
on where we've been delayed is reuniting
america has for the last several years

971
00:48:51,279 --> 00:48:53,269
focused on

972
00:48:53,269 --> 00:48:54,869
leadership education

973
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:58,489
and they've been focused on and i thank
you for the question it's a good one

974
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:02,430
they focused on bringing the leaders
from left to right a_c_l_u_

975
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:05,769
to to norquist others together

976
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:09,369
and what we've discovered is a from left
to right we have certain common grounds

977
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,499
among them civil liberties

978
00:49:11,499 --> 00:49:15,269
uh... from left to right world equally
concerned about civil liberties world

979
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:19,219
equally concerned about the budget
deficit world equally concerned about

980
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:20,489
the fact that

981
00:49:20,489 --> 00:49:24,739
were just losing ground internationally
overall

982
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:28,189
i'm hoping that the citizens summit
which is designed to take place in

983
00:49:28,189 --> 00:49:30,180
chicago on lincoln's birthday

984
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,299
two thousand nine

985
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:35,309
that the citizen summit will be the
first shot

986
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:38,859
in creating a citizen's political action
committee

987
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:41,450
and at every level

988
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:44,549
one of the beautiful things about your
card bank was booked the wealth of

989
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:51,349
networks by the way how many people are
standing in line freak show

990
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:55,019
okay all right i'm gonna try go fast and
what i'd like to do is go real real

991
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:57,210
shortened fast in the first hour

992
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,189
and then half of you can leave and then
in the second hour

993
00:50:00,189 --> 00:50:03,538
will start stretching and then the other
half of you can leave and then the two

994
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,060
people total left will sit here and talk
for

995
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:10,989
uh... for couple hours okay so i want to
be good to all of you alm

996
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:14,319
and also uh... you know we can we can
make this uh...

997
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,140
conventional show-and-tell or we can
make this really wild and crazy and talk

998
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,848
about

999
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,240
you know spy stuff which is what used to
keep people glued to their states

1000
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,589
february ninth it's lincoln's uh... well
i think it's like the twentieth but

1001
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:27,889
uh...

1002
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:31,899
fairy sometime if you're probably busy
citizens somebody fugotsten isn't summit

1003
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:33,109
dot u_s_

1004
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:36,089
or if you get a reuniting america dot
org

1005
00:50:36,089 --> 00:50:40,299
on you'll find it and all albee chaining
some stuff up but i'm certainly hoping

1006
00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:42,909
to have a convergence of hackers there

1007
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:46,809
because the ultimate hack in this
century is getting a government-backed

1008
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:53,769
uh...

1009
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:56,670
you've touched a little bit about your
thoughts on ralph nader has one or two

1010
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:00,420
collaborated on some of their party
presidential candidates this fall like

1011
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,939
uh... cynthia mckinney and uh... bob
barr

1012
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:05,529
and course roster

1013
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,859
locate it's a very very good question
and in the system is stacked against

1014
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:10,819
their cartoons

1015
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:11,989
for example

1016
00:51:11,989 --> 00:51:16,420
states have been allowed by the supreme
court to rule that independence to not

1017
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,929
have a right to be invited to the
debates

1018
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:22,299
uh... even independents who are running
on a legitimate slate

1019
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:24,819
uh... so the system is totally host

1020
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:28,409
and the only reason it's allowed to
remain hosed is because the courts are

1021
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:30,609
being allowed to trump the people

1022
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,819
and uh... we really need to

1023
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,949
we really need to ramp dropped this
whole thing now unfortunately

1024
00:51:36,949 --> 00:51:41,979
partly because there'd party candidacies
is so irrelevant now

1025
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:45,219
the third-party candidates are largely
nine entities

1026
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:46,299
uh...

1027
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:48,959
is mckinny that deep black woman

1028
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:52,939
uh... yes you were to be a democrat bob
are used to be a republican also my

1029
00:51:52,939 --> 00:51:56,709
grade we had you know these are adequate
to libertarian i don't believe much of

1030
00:51:56,709 --> 00:52:01,639
third parties a convenience i do believe
in libertarians i do believe arranged

1031
00:52:01,639 --> 00:52:03,689
along

1032
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:08,058
and unfortunately the greens the
libertarians of the reform seem to have

1033
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,499
staffs who's who's

1034
00:52:10,499 --> 00:52:15,289
who's a

1035
00:52:15,289 --> 00:52:19,369
and trying to figure out how to do for
five dollars

1036
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:23,419
i mean the staffs are these people are
so fucked up their exceeded only by the

1037
00:52:23,419 --> 00:52:27,179
fucked up to missus of obama-mccain
steps

1038
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,589
um...

1039
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:31,009
you know the staffs are all these

1040
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:35,009
insular people who're focused on
tactical get-out-the-vote whatever it

1041
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:39,499
takes there isn't a single one of them
but can do what i have done and fifteen

1042
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:40,679
minutes

1043
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:45,069
which is review the ten threats the
twelve policies ta challengers and then

1044
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:46,859
in my brief earlier this morning

1045
00:52:46,859 --> 00:52:49,759
it was actually a strategy in
operational clemente shoot for the

1046
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:51,139
internet and so forth

1047
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:52,859
cigs not rocket science

1048
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:55,649
the problem is is is massive disconnect

1049
00:52:55,649 --> 00:52:57,159
between what we know

1050
00:52:57,159 --> 00:52:58,629
what we can now

1051
00:52:58,629 --> 00:53:03,819
what we need to say and what they think
they need to say in order to get elected

1052
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:06,999
and and so the whole system is is just

1053
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:11,159
uh... it's terrible i mean you look at
mccain and obama i mean i think obama is

1054
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,769
going to have his uh...

1055
00:53:13,769 --> 00:53:15,849
dukakis moment

1056
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,830
uh... while he's traveling

1057
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:21,279
unites get big flap beers under psalm

1058
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,199
fighter pilot thing and in it's over

1059
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:26,439
along and i'll tell you right up front

1060
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:29,729
i mean i'm very concerned about our lack
of choice but the only reason that i

1061
00:53:29,729 --> 00:53:31,279
support mccain

1062
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:32,749
rather than obama

1063
00:53:32,749 --> 00:53:37,430
is because the next administration is
going to have to take the pentagon off

1064
00:53:37,430 --> 00:53:39,029
the public tip

1065
00:53:39,029 --> 00:53:40,199
along

1066
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:41,140
and is going to

1067
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,900
have to tell the pentagon

1068
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:46,630
your going to have to make do with one
third of the dollars that you've had in

1069
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:47,899
the past

1070
00:53:47,899 --> 00:53:51,269
and i guarantee you will bomb it doesn't
have the balls of the spine of the

1071
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,569
brains to do that mccain does

1072
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:54,909
on however

1073
00:53:54,909 --> 00:53:56,769
mccain lax

1074
00:53:56,769 --> 00:54:00,599
the staffing if i i mean he's got brent
scowcroft and colin powell if ralph

1075
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,279
peters a good friend

1076
00:54:02,279 --> 00:54:05,669
but mccain right now does not have a
staff structure

1077
00:54:05,669 --> 00:54:09,848
to do something as simple as talked to
david walker who's now park in new york

1078
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:12,829
david walkers the comptroller general
united states

1079
00:54:12,829 --> 00:54:17,729
who in july of nineteen at two thousand
seven told congress for bankrupt

1080
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:19,059
as a nation

1081
00:54:19,059 --> 00:54:22,529
and senators mccain and obama ignore

1082
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:25,359
the comptroller general united states

1083
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:29,529
and now peter peterson who wrote the
book running on empty our wire two

1084
00:54:29,529 --> 00:54:32,889
parties are betraying american what to
do about it he's the former chairman of

1085
00:54:32,889 --> 00:54:34,459
the council formulations

1086
00:54:34,459 --> 00:54:39,089
he is now funding david walker as the
citizens budget office

1087
00:54:39,089 --> 00:54:43,019
and so david walkers job is to
communicate to the citizens of self

1088
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:44,729
resigned really shitty job

1089
00:54:44,729 --> 00:54:48,400
on who's just been kinda hangin backed
out collecting his paycheck

1090
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,300
on

1091
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,759
but i'm hoping

1092
00:54:50,759 --> 00:54:54,380
that sometime in the next couple months
david walker will come out with with a

1093
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,959
balanced budget

1094
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,429
that addresses the tenth rats and and
addresses the temple of the twelve

1095
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,049
policies in harmony

1096
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:04,519
what no one else is doing is creating
the risky model

1097
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:08,189
they can then be migrated to china for
example it's idiocy for india to be

1098
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:11,919
creating cars even if they only cost two
thousand five hundred dollars

1099
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:15,759
india should be going toward mid-size
cities with high-speed rail

1100
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:21,259
and on inhofe on many cars and rental
you know kind of the zipcar concept

1101
00:55:21,259 --> 00:55:25,129
and we need to dramatically a salary
with the doctor doing with bicycles and

1102
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:27,130
bike trails and and uh...

1103
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,939
lights on and off of trains and all this
shit

1104
00:55:31,939 --> 00:55:33,569
is common sense

1105
00:55:33,569 --> 00:55:35,480
but unfortunately india

1106
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,899
apart from having thirty six wars going
on at any one time

1107
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:40,650
uh... within itself

1108
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,470
law india is really multiple india's
it's it's the i_t_n_ gear which is a

1109
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:49,539
very small exclusive maybe three percent
of the country

1110
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:52,979
and then it's the impoverished farming
india where two thousand farmers here

1111
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:56,579
commits suicide over gotten broughton
and so forth

1112
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:00,349
also let me stop with that and uh...
whoever's next

1113
00:56:00,349 --> 00:56:06,139
sat overhear who was next access control
please because i'm blind

1114
00:56:06,139 --> 00:56:08,169
so i'd like to go back to

1115
00:56:08,169 --> 00:56:12,240
with the nixon ministration bob what's
with that

1116
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,879
city resulted in within the police
programs

1117
00:56:16,879 --> 00:56:19,209
is basically a quorum

1118
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:24,059
for our crime problem you know where
everything we have these yield seven

1119
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,749
percent point and uh...

1120
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:30,039
so my point is

1121
00:56:30,039 --> 00:56:35,870
how do we get these go back to the less
productive uh... overflown agriculture

1122
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:40,049
we never know through the feeder within
the world's at some wonderful question

1123
00:56:40,049 --> 00:56:41,249
arm

1124
00:56:41,249 --> 00:56:43,889
got shaken by sector that so many levels

1125
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:48,189
alm let's start with the fact that we
have an industrial society that is based

1126
00:56:48,189 --> 00:56:52,669
on patrol in which produces plastic
which require scoring

1127
00:56:52,669 --> 00:56:54,479
which is booktitle

1128
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:55,909
pandora's poison

1129
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:58,009
on

1130
00:56:58,009 --> 00:56:59,579
hydro through iowa

1131
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:03,119
and i was looking at the whole point
thing and i didn't realize about pilot

1132
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,779
has to import corn for people to be

1133
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:09,599
because i was growing car

1134
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,739
to be force fed to cattle

1135
00:57:12,739 --> 00:57:15,719
who share his now i'd buy product in
spanish

1136
00:57:15,719 --> 00:57:17,059
arm

1137
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:19,539
and

1138
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:23,469
right now i mean you know here for those
of us that are recovering alcoholics

1139
00:57:23,469 --> 00:57:24,929
what's the alternative

1140
00:57:24,929 --> 00:57:26,259
uh...

1141
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:27,649
uh...

1142
00:57:27,649 --> 00:57:31,038
uh... effect if any once the whole thing
is afterwards i'll stay for about four

1143
00:57:31,039 --> 00:57:35,209
seconds

1144
00:57:35,209 --> 00:57:35,949
is

1145
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:39,509
the the whole issue of productivity as
as the was the point of your question

1146
00:57:39,509 --> 00:57:41,579
that i want focus on

1147
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:43,619
they're exactly to whom

1148
00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:47,059
agricultural models that are actually
sustainable

1149
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:50,199
one is the a mission the others acumen

1150
00:57:50,199 --> 00:57:53,849
and the reason the cuban model is
sustainable is because we embark wrote

1151
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:56,129
all of our pesticides

1152
00:57:56,129 --> 00:57:59,839
uh... and cuba went with a full
employment model

1153
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:05,299
that was less productive in the total
aggregate production but in fact turned

1154
00:58:05,299 --> 00:58:07,709
out to be much more fruitful

1155
00:58:07,709 --> 00:58:08,829
on

1156
00:58:08,829 --> 00:58:12,339
i think this whole move across america
tiki local

1157
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:13,409
is a good one

1158
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:16,889
i anticipate today when will start
tearing up strip malls and restoring

1159
00:58:16,889 --> 00:58:19,199
local agricultural product of that

1160
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,259
calm

1161
00:58:21,259 --> 00:58:23,759
i anticipate today plans

1162
00:58:23,759 --> 00:58:26,729
when cities may even be abandoned

1163
00:58:26,729 --> 00:58:31,289
are if we don't find enough power fast
enough or portions of cities will be

1164
00:58:31,289 --> 00:58:35,309
abandoned and turn into the mayan
rulings you know

1165
00:58:35,309 --> 00:58:39,089
all by the way it is a wonderful book
called fourteen ninety one

1166
00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:42,689
which talks about all the knowledge that
the mayans had about

1167
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:46,479
deep group farming i mean they were
actually forming the amazon

1168
00:58:46,479 --> 00:58:50,449
they have figured out how to make the
amazon do what they wanted without strip

1169
00:58:50,449 --> 00:58:51,459
for me

1170
00:58:51,459 --> 00:58:55,009
on so the whole issue of agricultural
products cavity

1171
00:58:55,009 --> 00:59:00,469
is one that has to be considered in this
larger context for example in india

1172
00:59:00,469 --> 00:59:04,249
a french company went in there and in
partnership with the demean guy who's

1173
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:06,799
nobel prize winner and rightly so

1174
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,189
they created a nutritious yoghurt

1175
00:59:10,189 --> 00:59:13,888
in a disposable biodegradable container

1176
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:18,039
that could be afforded by poor indian
mothers for their kids

1177
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:22,669
and the whole model of capitalism is in
the process of turning on its head right

1178
00:59:22,669 --> 00:59:25,658
now we have immoral predatory capitalism

1179
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:29,469
that is focused on the billion at the
top who can afford to replace their

1180
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:31,969
sub-zero fridge every three years

1181
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:32,979
okay

1182
00:59:32,979 --> 00:59:35,799
and african refrigerator cost two
dollars

1183
00:59:35,799 --> 00:59:37,099
it's a cement

1184
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:40,919
jar with the long active year gap
another cements are with the long neck

1185
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:43,400
and buried in the ground keeps me fresh

1186
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,389
for five days

1187
00:59:45,389 --> 00:59:46,839
cost two dollars

1188
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:51,779
also this whole issue of of and and seek
a powerful oddness is one of a handful

1189
00:59:51,779 --> 00:59:54,180
of people who have deeply influenced me

1190
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:58,859
he wrote this book called a fortune at
the bottom of pyramid he points out

1191
00:59:58,859 --> 01:00:03,529
modern capitalism is based on not only
two billion at the top

1192
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:05,939
but on an infinite liberty

1193
01:00:05,939 --> 01:00:09,288
to basically consume the earth and talks
of five years but i mean there's a book

1194
01:00:09,289 --> 01:00:11,099
called high-tech trash

1195
01:00:11,099 --> 01:00:15,190
on there many other books along these
things uh...

1196
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:19,860
uh... so the five billion at the bottom
most interestingly have four trillion a

1197
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:20,999
year

1198
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,200
one trillion

1199
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,309
four trillion

1200
01:00:23,309 --> 01:00:24,779
that's the future

1201
01:00:24,779 --> 01:00:28,699
and i gave an invited rental paul allen
general corporation back in ninety three

1202
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:32,079
ninety four you can find it by looking
for god man

1203
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,769
and uh... interval

1204
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:36,189
on and my name

1205
01:00:36,189 --> 01:00:38,649
analysts s dot net not on our account

1206
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:42,349
but no

1207
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:45,699
cannot drop him off the side of the
building

1208
01:00:45,699 --> 01:00:46,739
um...

1209
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:52,119
locate yet you know about on recovering
alcoholic it's no longer funny arm

1210
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,899
and i really uh... i i say that because
i've discovered that the more i stay at

1211
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:57,210
the storm right field

1212
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:59,630
on

1213
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,849
what we have here is they need

1214
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:06,369
we have a need to really understand

1215
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:09,349
the future of the planet depends on full
employment

1216
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,429
it also depends on education

1217
01:01:11,429 --> 01:01:15,049
uh... the best dollar invested in
foreign aid is is invested in the

1218
01:01:15,049 --> 01:01:17,159
educational woman

1219
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:20,660
unity candle woman she doesn't put up
with the drunk ass hole anymore

1220
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,959
on a she finds a way to get a micro loan
you had no clue

1221
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:28,649
it god bless the army my life as a saint

1222
01:01:28,649 --> 01:01:32,118
unleashes but up a lot of ship which is
one of the reasons why i got interested

1223
01:01:32,119 --> 01:01:33,500
recently of it

1224
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,150
of the economics between order midwife
them

1225
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,569
uh... man and kind of looking at that

1226
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:41,589
of

1227
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:44,490
practice somehow i think the light of
that getting the better part

1228
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,459
of the deal

1229
01:01:45,459 --> 01:01:48,099
uh... at least after year five

1230
01:01:48,099 --> 01:01:49,769
of

1231
01:01:49,769 --> 01:01:53,529
so uh... it's a fascinating world and
that's the world that i honest to god

1232
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:56,249
believe is rich in promise

1233
01:01:56,249 --> 01:02:00,380
on if groups like this take the tools
that they have

1234
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:04,590
and i personally and anti cool i know
we've got a lot of google spies in the

1235
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:07,519
audience and some not so

1236
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:12,599
uh... some somewhat moreover

1237
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:13,689
lol

1238
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:17,149
was a good idea they went there

1239
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:18,729
uh...

1240
01:02:18,729 --> 01:02:22,289
uh... there's two analytic reports which
in combination will cost two thousand

1241
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:23,609
dollars

1242
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:29,569
but you can read my book review this one
book called the global that's fine

1243
01:02:29,569 --> 01:02:31,549
i'm sorry again are trying to help you

1244
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:34,169
uh... if if i can't no sweat leave

1245
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:36,069
on

1246
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:41,779
the second book is called global two
point only calculating predator

1247
01:02:41,779 --> 01:02:44,230
now global is going to things

1248
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,039
one of which is really good one of which
is really bad

1249
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,089
the really good is they've taken
computational mathematics to levels it

1250
01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:51,799
is

1251
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:52,889
out of this world

1252
01:02:52,889 --> 01:02:54,359
it's another planet

1253
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,538
and it's quite quite spectacular

1254
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,929
on the other hand you've got a guy named
carol of the up and and canada whose

1255
01:02:59,929 --> 01:03:03,829
creating information act of the
information coming meddling which

1256
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:08,729
which has to address and try to ask for
every word and concept across all

1257
01:03:08,729 --> 01:03:09,849
languages

1258
01:03:09,849 --> 01:03:13,229
meaning that you will eventually have an
automatic machine translation for the

1259
01:03:13,229 --> 01:03:14,659
word dog

1260
01:03:14,659 --> 01:03:16,789
or for the word the or whatever

1261
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:17,809
on

1262
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:20,789
but we're cool i'm wrong

1263
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:23,459
is in deciding that

1264
01:03:23,459 --> 01:03:28,429
it return money by misrepresenting and
deceiving people

1265
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:32,579
on and i had a slight yesterday which
shows the universe is information that

1266
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:35,919
it shows what search engines pull up and
then it shows what a programmable search

1267
01:03:35,919 --> 01:03:37,658
engine pulls up

1268
01:03:37,659 --> 01:03:42,949
a programmable search engine shows you
what someone else is paid for you to say

1269
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:45,169
that's evil

1270
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:47,209
and uh... i like larry

1271
01:03:47,209 --> 01:03:49,319
uh... serbian air

1272
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:53,159
but their engineers and engineers don't
know shit about affects

1273
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:54,179
uh...

1274
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:56,219
you really have lost

1275
01:03:56,219 --> 01:03:58,730
and i can't surf is a personal friend

1276
01:03:58,730 --> 01:04:00,499
week sushi together

1277
01:04:00,499 --> 01:04:03,819
and i tried to warn vented larry
brilliant that they were being used as

1278
01:04:03,819 --> 01:04:05,619
posted filled in for you

1279
01:04:05,619 --> 01:04:06,510
palm

1280
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,260
and i think we really need to take it
very seriously dated cisco comes out

1281
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:13,369
with an application or even network
appointed creation

1282
01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:16,149
the group like stars

1283
01:04:16,149 --> 01:04:20,269
right now the global plexes depending on
this very large atmosphere what what the

1284
01:04:20,269 --> 01:04:25,590
c_e_o_s of i_b_m_ in oracle and
microsoft in sap others except nokia

1285
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:28,109
hook you may end up being the neck
school

1286
01:04:28,109 --> 01:04:29,889
on

1287
01:04:29,889 --> 01:04:34,459
they don't understand the global is not
search

1288
01:04:34,459 --> 01:04:36,719
that generates advertising revenue

1289
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,619
gobel is is jog or not

1290
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,829
applications in the clouds

1291
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:45,979
and people you have to really understand
entire patton structure which steve

1292
01:04:45,979 --> 01:04:50,289
arnold my my virtual c_t_ l has done and
angle to point out

1293
01:04:50,289 --> 01:04:53,479
on you have to understand entire patton
infrastructure you have to understand

1294
01:04:53,479 --> 01:04:56,670
all of their little moves you know they
they kind of

1295
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,010
send out these little

1296
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:01,119
lifeboats likely going to
telecommunications in the pullback

1297
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:02,859
people in the banking pullback

1298
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:06,348
people entertainment hold back by the
publishing pullback what people don't

1299
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:10,210
understand is those are exploratory
things to test the concepts and once

1300
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,579
they know they work

1301
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,799
they're holding back

1302
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:17,049
global conflict a hit

1303
01:05:17,049 --> 01:05:18,059
in eliminating

1304
01:05:18,059 --> 01:05:21,579
the financial communications
entertainment and publishing industry's

1305
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:24,249
overnight

1306
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:27,769
and the problem that i have with this
apart from their thinking that they can

1307
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:33,219
bake and uh... allow people with money
to determine what people with brain c

1308
01:05:33,219 --> 01:05:35,099
the problem that i have with this

1309
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:37,669
on

1310
01:05:37,669 --> 01:05:41,170
africa what the problem is that i have
with this but i have a profit

1311
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,139
guy

1312
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,369
dot

1313
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:45,349
all right next question

1314
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:50,059
i'm not a bit perplexed by or lack of
action on through the trustees the last

1315
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:52,549
decade or however many as you want to go

1316
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:57,189
some curious about your thoughts uh...
of that and if you think food is a big

1317
01:05:57,189 --> 01:06:00,219
part of that and if so is there any
uh...

1318
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:03,660
placing your in any of your plans for
food in it than that

1319
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,289
integration that streams

1320
01:06:06,289 --> 01:06:09,179
are you saying the home

1321
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:13,889
the atrocities like tar four associated
with starvation a migration toward no

1322
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:16,869
with our government and that's our
experience in this country

1323
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:20,179
and and the fact that we have had a nice
world

1324
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:23,659
well text that's an interesting point
because one of the things that one of

1325
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:28,239
the things i've learned the hard way is
a good people trapped in bad systems

1326
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:30,789
try to do good and end up doing great
dad

1327
01:06:30,789 --> 01:06:32,319
uh...

1328
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,919
i mean our government is not evil at the
personal level

1329
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:37,179
on

1330
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:41,219
it's it's really only evil in what gets
a lot to do in our name i mean i'm

1331
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:44,609
stunned that we're not out burning tires
in the streets

1332
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:45,620
mom

1333
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,259
and then in many ways the internet has
become of them

1334
01:06:49,259 --> 01:06:53,249
uh... for people who would otherwise be
out in the streets burning flags and

1335
01:06:53,249 --> 01:06:56,029
tires and so forth

1336
01:06:56,029 --> 01:06:58,519
food is a fundamental

1337
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:02,459
and one of the problems that i have in
the united states is is this whole issue

1338
01:07:02,459 --> 01:07:04,039
will be city

1339
01:07:04,039 --> 01:07:07,789
i mean i love has logged in you know
disrespecting any persons have it

1340
01:07:07,789 --> 01:07:09,529
because it's not your fault

1341
01:07:09,529 --> 01:07:10,530
on

1342
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:15,770
actually had a no i had a slight had a
slight in my view should go look at my

1343
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:19,099
twelve actually the health slide is not
there

1344
01:07:19,099 --> 01:07:21,479
may i bring up the health science

1345
01:07:21,479 --> 01:07:24,389
let's do that let's talk about health
and food for a minute

1346
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:25,389
parm

1347
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:28,639
in anytime you guys wanna take a
bathroom break please do

1348
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:32,179
of the generally when i finish a picture
i go

1349
01:07:32,179 --> 01:07:34,640
and uh... security clears the way

1350
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,489
and uh... then i come back

1351
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:40,289
and this is a speak very light and
easygoing and obviously is you're bored

1352
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,170
you can leave

1353
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:44,249
on but uh...

1354
01:07:44,249 --> 01:07:47,839
if i may make a comment guarantees me as
americans spend more money on health

1355
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,949
care last year than food

1356
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:53,779
well that's a good common and
pricewaterhousecoopers had uh... a house

1357
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:57,579
study that came out recently have posted
a copy dose s dot net

1358
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:01,949
uh... which says it fifty percent of our
spending on health is waste

1359
01:08:01,949 --> 01:08:05,630
okay week we have an industrial eric
health system and i'm rather proud of

1360
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,709
this life

1361
01:08:06,709 --> 01:08:10,119
on

1362
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,660
beacause i created and i'm not a health
experts

1363
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,799
okay i created it

1364
01:08:15,799 --> 01:08:19,979
all after talking to a few people for
fifteen or twenty minutes since israel

1365
01:08:19,979 --> 01:08:22,029
of this my son made this

1366
01:08:22,029 --> 01:08:25,420
for those of you weren't in the other
session this is the world brain inside

1367
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:28,350
of the cosmos and down near the pig with
lipstick

1368
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:33,839
that's the u_s_ intelligence community
uh...

1369
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:40,839
it's an honor you've seen them

1370
01:08:42,339 --> 01:08:48,568
sears

1371
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:51,290
there someone else did that i love it

1372
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:56,559
night let's leave this one up for couple
seconds

1373
01:08:56,559 --> 01:09:03,559
can you read it in the back

1374
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:08,130
i am not making this up

1375
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,618
even worse than that we have officers
like at the national ground intelligence

1376
01:09:11,618 --> 01:09:15,598
center whose sole purpose in life is to
fabricate data

1377
01:09:15,599 --> 01:09:17,049
manipulate data

1378
01:09:17,049 --> 01:09:23,028
decree justifications for weapons
systems we don't need that we can afford

1379
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:24,489
you know what's going on here

1380
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:27,609
this is this is my version of of

1381
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:30,130
good thinking

1382
01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:33,599
all right here's aside i was talking
about and here's cools programmable

1383
01:09:33,599 --> 01:09:35,589
search engine

1384
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:41,738
evil

1385
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:47,169
this is all on the internet this is the
uh... harmless than five hundred million

1386
01:09:47,169 --> 01:09:49,249
talk about that later

1387
01:09:49,249 --> 01:09:53,028
while this is really cool people decide
down from our web site you can drill

1388
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,560
down it's a p_b_s_

1389
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,920
inside of a of the power point

1390
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:00,739
and so it's scales infinitely any
control down to what my friend declared

1391
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:01,349
innocent

1392
01:10:01,349 --> 01:10:02,770
bread ashford on

1393
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:06,679
which is shown how all of the sciences
on our purple cider related call the

1394
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:07,769
humanities

1395
01:10:07,769 --> 01:10:11,590
and at the u_n_ i_r_s_ the intersection

1396
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:15,510
of cognitive science and collective
intelligence a merchant

1397
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,949
but we already have a world brain

1398
01:10:17,949 --> 01:10:22,260
screw web three point on web four point
already here

1399
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,969
what we need is your men that works with
low level two lbs

1400
01:10:25,969 --> 01:10:28,850
period were to do sense making on the
fly

1401
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:32,449
all of this is all of us feedback stuff
i love no back he's got a chapter in the

1402
01:10:32,449 --> 01:10:36,539
book which please by i mean i i can dry
before boxes away

1403
01:10:36,539 --> 01:10:40,938
but they would be really are uh...
amazing amazing collections of work

1404
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:41,769
on

1405
01:10:41,769 --> 01:10:45,219
i'm building this

1406
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:46,389
okay

1407
01:10:46,389 --> 01:10:49,679
or are we here this is the whole picture

1408
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:50,739
okay

1409
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:56,349
i really liked this life

1410
01:10:56,349 --> 01:10:58,669
i mean what does it say when

1411
01:10:58,669 --> 01:11:02,259
if you decide you want to have a twenty
four seven existence you have to live on

1412
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:03,649
twenties

1413
01:11:03,649 --> 01:11:04,719
uh...

1414
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:08,360
you know versus something wrong with the
society that doesn't give you better

1415
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,500
options

1416
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,670
on at the same time is something wrong
with the society that has so many things

1417
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:17,050
inserted into foods and and uh...

1418
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:20,340
the atmosphere and so forth that you're
essentially living in an unhealthy

1419
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,710
environment

1420
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:26,619
limine their some people would say that
alzheimer's is a misdiagnosed form of

1421
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,438
metcalf

1422
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:30,320
on

1423
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,530
and then finally an actual turner
remediation

1424
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,090
and i mention this in the other session
but uh... declare vince's wife is very

1425
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:42,209
very wealthy and who believes and an
alternative a natural medicine

1426
01:11:42,209 --> 01:11:43,300
very much

1427
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,550
uh... he has acid reflux disease

1428
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:49,760
as they went to western doctors are we
got all kinds of things we can do we

1429
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:51,340
could even have surgical

1430
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,560
uh... intervention here and and
eliminate that then he went to a chinese

1431
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,499
back in india document both said the
same thing

1432
01:11:57,499 --> 01:11:58,300
asshole

1433
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,540
stock meeting me

1434
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:04,510
uh... after twelve o'clock during the
day and get off caffeine

1435
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:06,380
and of acid reflux

1436
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:07,190
okay

1437
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:08,110
so

1438
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:09,420
the knowledge

1439
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:14,300
that is available in actual turn into
medicine is being deliberately repressed

1440
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,010
but big pharma

1441
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:20,079
and finally you have surgical
pharmaceutical intervention well i'm

1442
01:12:20,079 --> 01:12:21,910
actually developing a whole book

1443
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:25,939
and even publish it part of my piece
intelligence book on health intelligence

1444
01:12:25,939 --> 01:12:29,820
and one of the things you find out is
that evidence based medicine is the

1445
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,590
quickest way you can scare any search

1446
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,570
because most surgeries are not based on
evidence

1447
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,679
their elective surgeries

1448
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:42,849
and i like john edwards but he became a
millionaire by putting the doctors out

1449
01:12:42,849 --> 01:12:46,280
of business so that that doctors could
do more operations that were not needed

1450
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,500
on one

1451
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,429
on

1452
01:12:49,429 --> 01:12:52,599
and so this whole thing surgical
remedial term but then on the positive

1453
01:12:52,599 --> 01:12:56,000
side surgically mediation opens up the
whole idea of

1454
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,940
uh... telemedicine

1455
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,010
i mean right now you've got uh...
homework help from india

1456
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:04,919
where for eighteen dollars an hour you
can get a p_h_d_ student walking your

1457
01:13:04,919 --> 01:13:08,939
kid through math which i certainly meet
because i have no clue

1458
01:13:08,939 --> 01:13:12,260
well beyond two plus two equals six alm

1459
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,340
and and so you have

1460
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,030
telemedicine

1461
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,518
you have medical tourism

1462
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:23,300
i'll go to thailand have your heart six
get late come back you know kirk katha

1463
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,790
pollitt

1464
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:28,230
and then you have pharmaceutical
remediation but pharmaceutically

1465
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:32,320
mediation the drugs that we pay six
hundred dollars four per unit

1466
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,750
we combine canada for sixty dollars and
that's as far as most of the world goes

1467
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:40,300
i have a friend who is about to launch
an admission of who spent the last

1468
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:41,630
seven years

1469
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:45,510
inventory costs of the top seventy five
drugs worldwide

1470
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:52,010
and we have found that we can lower the
medicare costs the united states to

1471
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:56,260
instead of six hundred dollars instead
of sixty dollars we pay six dollars

1472
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:59,500
that one percent of september

1473
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,290
okay so one percent

1474
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:04,940
one person

1475
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:10,309
artist vision of this giant dildo with
florence going up the form is ass i mean

1476
01:14:10,309 --> 01:14:13,100
it's just so good

1477
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,709
on that note is that

1478
01:14:14,709 --> 01:14:17,010
it

1479
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:21,989
case ten-year plans for permanent
servant implementation

1480
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:23,079
all year

1481
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:24,019
uh...

1482
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:27,199
yes what's acting like a nice

1483
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:32,300
flying i am very complicated life i
guess i i ask because i think it is time

1484
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,030
very passionate about defects on us

1485
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:38,910
and i think it is really important for
us to consider well i i agree and in

1486
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:43,190
fact i wrote a book or actually put
together a book trying to help

1487
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:47,420
congressman simmons get elected and and
is believed to have to be handed out

1488
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:51,610
long-term serious i get a book called
smart made a smart nation at public

1489
01:14:51,610 --> 01:14:53,699
intelligence in the public interest

1490
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:57,819
and all i've published it at my own
expensive two hundred forty copies to

1491
01:14:57,819 --> 01:14:59,210
simmons staff and said

1492
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,079
and this out to every thought leader in
his district

1493
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,119
and two newspapers turned against them

1494
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:07,880
not because he was a bad congressman but
because he didn't have any big ideas

1495
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,719
he lost by eighty votes

1496
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:12,949
had those two hundred and forty books
been handed out he would've won by at

1497
01:15:12,949 --> 01:15:14,449
least fifty votes

1498
01:15:14,449 --> 01:15:15,660
palm

1499
01:15:15,660 --> 01:15:16,949
anyway

1500
01:15:16,949 --> 01:15:18,429
health eat

1501
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:20,150
country

1502
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:22,659
you know uh...

1503
01:15:22,659 --> 01:15:24,839
hans morgantown

1504
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:27,079
uh... power politics

1505
01:15:27,079 --> 01:15:28,080
if i got it right

1506
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:31,530
someone who was here in the seventies

1507
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:34,599
the the the the population is one of the
most

1508
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,079
on the mantle

1509
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:38,978
foundations for national power

1510
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:41,079
and so

1511
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:44,880
we have had a whole series of other
administrations in fact is this

1512
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:47,360
something called an s_s_ d_m_

1513
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,839
two thousand

1514
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,380
which was an attempt in the united
states to have a population policy

1515
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:57,440
it was an attempt to understand the
demographics of aging the demographics

1516
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:01,770
of immigration how you want a manager
population so that you have a healthy

1517
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:07,780
vibrant population with a good asian
gender mix of all this alm

1518
01:16:07,780 --> 01:16:09,630
and in

1519
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:12,860
didn't ask for the same reason we don't
have an industrial policy

1520
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,049
an industrial policy would assure

1521
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:18,099
that not only do we have a strategic
petroleum reserve

1522
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:22,620
but we have the ability to convert from
automobiles the tanks overnight

1523
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:25,219
uh... and we don't have that either

1524
01:16:25,219 --> 01:16:26,699
food is fundamental

1525
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:30,310
and francis low pay more is one of my
favorite people

1526
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:33,130
she wrote a book called i had for a
small planet

1527
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:38,879
uh... the essence of that book is still
vegetarian and although

1528
01:16:38,879 --> 01:16:43,759
hi have myself never done that except in
france and went to prom aunts uh...

1529
01:16:43,759 --> 01:16:46,199
france for a for a couple weeks

1530
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:48,150
i was in the seminar

1531
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:51,320
and the fed is vegetarian food for two
weeks and i loved it

1532
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,610
it was great

1533
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:54,348
i have no i had no

1534
01:16:54,349 --> 01:16:56,230
absolutely zero

1535
01:16:56,230 --> 01:17:00,449
of withdrawal symptoms from meat or
sausage report for anything else

1536
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:04,139
all it's possible to have a healthy diet
that does not

1537
01:17:04,139 --> 01:17:08,659
support mega farms of cattle and sheep
pigs analysts other stuff

1538
01:17:08,659 --> 01:17:12,330
uh... so doctor small planet very very
good

1539
01:17:12,330 --> 01:17:13,359
palm

1540
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:17,239
francis slop anymore has uh... has
written other books since then including

1541
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:18,909
her latest get a grip

1542
01:17:18,909 --> 01:17:21,688
i recommend all the books by francis
left him more

1543
01:17:21,689 --> 01:17:25,760
on and so i would say to you the health
info dirt or the fundamentals

1544
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:29,840
and an enlightened president would have
an agricultural secretary of interior

1545
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:32,670
secretary committee member food
secretary

1546
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:35,519
and then you have the whole issue of
food security

1547
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:37,760
i mean our food security socks

1548
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,389
are you know this i mean f_d_a_ has
never gonna figure where the salmonella

1549
01:17:41,389 --> 01:17:43,300
came from things

1550
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,869
accepted there too many there too many
sources

1551
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:49,139
so i thank you for bringing up this
whole issue of food

1552
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:52,579
i think it's fundamental you are what
you eat in many ways

1553
01:17:52,579 --> 01:17:53,540
om

1554
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,790
which is why look younger this year

1555
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:57,400
next question

1556
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:01,879
yaha actual implied leaves uh... talking
about health uh... because i don't get

1557
01:18:01,879 --> 01:18:04,280
of the few from your earlier time

1558
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,110
uh... just because

1559
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:09,599
you talked about alternative medicine
and

1560
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,599
evidence based medicine as if they were

1561
01:18:12,599 --> 01:18:15,079
diametrically opposed

1562
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:16,210
and uh...

1563
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:18,420
that's the reason the definition would

1564
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,579
that the uh... knows no alternative
medicine was that it's all things not

1565
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:24,320
only because there's no evidence that

1566
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:28,179
and to the example that used of

1567
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:31,340
not eating meet before bedtime i mean
that's

1568
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:34,230
something that

1569
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:39,170
is not you know chinese medicine that's
that's not non western medicine that's

1570
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,459
just like

1571
01:18:40,459 --> 01:18:44,309
proven evidence based medicine that just
so happen to be given by an alternative

1572
01:18:44,309 --> 01:18:45,230
dr

1573
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:48,670
wayne alternative medicine is you know

1574
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:53,179
energy zones in the body and sticking
needles into the man

1575
01:18:53,179 --> 01:18:54,979
things like that

1576
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:58,109
well i i don't i don't we don't need to
we don't need argue about semantics

1577
01:18:58,109 --> 01:19:03,319
uh... and then one thing i did say meyer
thing is that we found that acupuncture

1578
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:06,239
actually is wonderful apparently the
asian

1579
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,819
which then allows other things to happen
so no i'm not here quibble with you

1580
01:19:09,819 --> 01:19:11,130
about the terms

1581
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:14,310
law and i'm sure that that this light
can be improved

1582
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:16,039
palm

1583
01:19:16,039 --> 01:19:18,249
yeah i i i take your point uh...

1584
01:19:18,249 --> 01:19:21,478
and i can change is for the whole idea
here is that within the context of this

1585
01:19:21,479 --> 01:19:23,429
life

1586
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:24,320
nobody

1587
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,809
is cataloging

1588
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:28,880
the true cost to society the true cost
to heal

1589
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,349
for all those things that are
preventable and all those things that

1590
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,820
are not prevent money

1591
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:34,559

1593
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,969
elementary school than a year does not
go by

1594
01:19:41,969 --> 01:19:46,300

1595
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,860
kids with allergies peanuts

1596
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,139

that payments i mean allergies

1597
01:19:53,139 --> 01:19:54,920
arora thing

1598

and is is just bad for us

1601
01:20:09,310 --> 01:20:12,540
so let's ask another question in fact

1602
01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:16,119
three am thinking we should stop until

01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:04,820
and if you're doing uh... terrorist
meetings which i did i was one of the

1618
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,849
first garcetti tears full-time

1619
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:08,929

the session and then you have to do
transcript yourself

1621

song

1622
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:17,648
you know and that's a real pain in the
ass

1623
01:21:17,649 --> 01:21:20,860
well it's like being a cop you know it's

the craft of intelligence and miles
copeland without cloak work better

1629
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:40,840
the problem was spying is that it's a
facade

1630
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,650
uh... he can be a good spy if you insist
on going in and out of an embassy five

1631
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:46,839
times a day

1632
01:21:46,839 --> 01:21:50,419
on if you're a junior officer who's
spending more money than the political

1633
01:21:50,419 --> 01:21:51,719
counselor

1634
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:52,940
law

1635
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:54,550

or will we go to steal a codebook
everybody comes into the embassy at five

1639
01:22:02,039 --> 01:22:04,379
o'clock at night for the evening
briefing

1640
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:08,899
and the gate guard sewer local nationals
called the a's on which employs a missus

1641
01:22:08,899 --> 01:22:10,840
a_c_l_u_'s working tonight

that very quickly find out which target

1643
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:18,979
work casing and or which part we're
actually going into after year of casing

1644
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:22,409
and then the next morning after we saw
on the color books locally isn't as an

1645
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:26,268
investment as they see a great cookbooks
outside

1646
01:22:26,269 --> 01:22:28,719
and n_s_a_ pretense this really matters

1647
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:30,239
uh...

1648
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:32,539
you know it's it's just unbelievable

1649
01:22:32,539 --> 01:22:33,619
long

1650
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:35,429
diplomatic pouches are fine

1651
01:22:35,429 --> 01:22:37,460
their accompanied on a company

1652
01:22:37,460 --> 01:22:39,429
uh... we can walk through walls

1653
01:22:39,429 --> 01:22:40,490
on

1654
01:22:40,490 --> 01:22:43,690
the way you walk through walls except
that it gets harder when you've got

1655
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:45,129
humans are dogs

1656
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:46,070
on

1657
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:49,280
but the way you want to wallace is
basically be able to get to any system a

1658
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:51,938
digital systems are really giving them a
problem

1659
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:53,119
alone

1660
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:56,400
because they're you're much much more
cumbersome

1661
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:00,820
and much you know backups and and so
forth especially webcam backups that are

1662
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:03,980
remotely monitored now now you're in
deep shit

1663
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,900
and this whole mission impossible thing
doesn't happen

1664
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,080
uh...

1665
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,969
john perry barlow lyricist for the
grateful dead co-founder of the f f i

1666
01:23:11,969 --> 01:23:15,269
got him into c_i_a_ after my first
conference

1667
01:23:15,269 --> 01:23:19,650
and he wrote an article in forbes called
wise five think it was

1668
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:23,699
and he said if you want to see the last
vestiges of the soviet gulag go to

1669
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:24,829
c_i_a_

1670
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:27,070
we're talking gray metal desks

1671
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:31,209
we're talking a city phone system of
securing an secure phone so badly

1672
01:23:31,209 --> 01:23:35,849
designed you can't tell which phone is
ringing

1673
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:39,429
uh... i mean it it's uh... with the tip
of a hat tonight at a rally he talks

1674
01:23:39,429 --> 01:23:44,630
about open source as darwinism and and
mall wherein proprietary software is as

1675
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:45,969
intelligent design

1676
01:23:45,969 --> 01:23:47,550
it's not so intelligent

1677
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:50,739
well i got news for you our spies are
clueless

1678
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:54,719
uh... we have occasional successes
afghanistan was a success after a

1679
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:58,320
fashion but only after charlie wilson
for c_i_a_ to do its job

1680
01:23:58,320 --> 01:23:59,469
uh...

1681
01:23:59,469 --> 01:24:00,709
and sold

1682
01:24:00,709 --> 01:24:04,358
their issues there i think that's fine
at like the answer fiber six quick

1683
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:08,159
questions so throw throw 'em out

1684
01:24:08,159 --> 01:24:09,398
you'd

1685
01:24:09,399 --> 01:24:12,520
yes legacy of ashes isn't excellent book

1686
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,719
i've reviewed it

1687
01:24:13,719 --> 01:24:14,959
on

1688
01:24:14,959 --> 01:24:18,119
by the way it's unfortunate

1689
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:21,749
and i swear this is not self promotion
but if you want to read my review when

1690
01:24:21,749 --> 01:24:24,739
it's been very by hundreds of other
reviews

1691
01:24:24,739 --> 01:24:28,629
i'm sorry that you have to pick me as an
interesting person that's the way amazon

1692
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:29,540
works

1693
01:24:29,540 --> 01:24:32,810
if you can someone else taught me this
if you pick me is an interesting person

1694
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,709
then every time you look at a book

1695
01:24:34,709 --> 01:24:37,679
if i have reviewed my review part of the
top

1696
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:40,439
and i write what are called summative
reviews

1697
01:24:40,439 --> 01:24:44,489
and i'm one of the very few reviewers it
also provides links to other books

1698
01:24:44,489 --> 01:24:49,900
so you can kind of follow a path here
and read my reviews across all three

1699
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:53,420
hundred or four hundred intelligence
books that i reviewed became an amazon

1700
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,010
reviewer by accident

1701
01:24:55,010 --> 01:24:56,699
on had written two books

1702
01:24:56,699 --> 01:25:00,169

1703
01:25:00,169 --> 01:25:02,499
intelligence personal public and
political

1704
01:25:02,499 --> 01:25:05,789

bibliography and i loaded both one

1705
01:25:05,789 --> 01:25:07,929

01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:12,969
on

1709
01:25:12,969 --> 01:25:16,179
and then over time i kinda got booked

five thousand here a books

1711

six hundred thing which is beautiful

1712
01:25:23,849 --> 01:25:27,810
that when i didn't buy something on the
originals but uh... but i put a real

01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:49,858
these it talks about the origins of
hacking at m_i_t_

1720
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:52,530
on and that's what prepared me

1721
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:55,829
emotionally in the nineteen late
nineteen eighties to understand hackers

1722
01:25:55,829 --> 01:25:57,330
when i was first invited

1723
01:25:57,330 --> 01:25:58,550
to speak here

1724
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:02,780
i mean i very proud of myself for having
understood that hackers are like

1725
01:26:02,780 --> 01:26:05,099
astronauts they have the right stuff

1726
01:26:05,099 --> 01:26:09,289
and i offered to keep fire opt out of
jail but they thought i'd be worse in

1727
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:09,940
jail

1728
01:26:09,940 --> 01:26:13,289
also they wouldn't let him come

1729
01:26:13,289 --> 01:26:17,369
but anyway so this is all good uh...
another question

1730
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:20,379
what about espionage

1731
01:26:20,379 --> 01:26:22,090
alright industrial espionage

1732
01:26:22,090 --> 01:26:25,760
you know i was in that i was in france
in nineteen ninety three in the french

1733
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,070
are very good at industrial espionage

1734
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:32,090
uh... in fact most industrial espionage
against the united states is carried out

1735
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:33,560
by its friends

1736
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,290
uh...

1737
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:37,989
germany france

1738
01:26:37,989 --> 01:26:41,190
all yeah israel my god promise

1739
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:45,119
many americans are so stupid that
israelis uh... unfortunately until joe

1740
01:26:45,119 --> 01:26:48,380
lieberman leaves the senate that's going
to continue to be the case

1741
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:51,139
uh... he is israel's defector

1742
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,580
real ambassador

1743
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:53,440
uh...

1744
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:55,249
in the united states

1745
01:26:55,249 --> 01:26:59,188
but he was never a democrat he was a new
continent tration of them democratic

1746
01:26:59,189 --> 01:27:00,099
party

1747
01:27:00,099 --> 01:27:01,190
palm

1748
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:05,260
and he's also sanctimonious ass hole
oscar

1749
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:10,130
health i mean the separation of church
and state is supposed to apply it to

1750
01:27:10,130 --> 01:27:12,090
senatorial statements

1751
01:27:12,090 --> 01:27:16,729
on in the invocation of god at every
turn is just as bad as prayer meetings

1752
01:27:16,729 --> 01:27:18,199
that are mandatory

1753
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:23,329
uh...

1754
01:27:23,329 --> 01:27:27,239
part of the problem and i was in france
in nineteen ninety-three and i heard i

1755
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:30,320
was at a competitive intelligence
conference and the head of the french

1756
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:31,619
steel industry

1757
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:34,339
stood up and he said you know we made a
mistake

1758
01:27:34,339 --> 01:27:39,449
he said we we carried out essentially
industrial espionage against uh... the

1759
01:27:39,449 --> 01:27:42,920
steel industry in the united states and
elsewhere

1760
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:47,439
but we completely missed the fact that
plastics was coming up

1761
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:51,570
and plastics ended up taking away the
aftermarket parts

1762
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:52,830
for automobiles

1763
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:56,159
and then it ended up becoming the
primary source of

1764
01:27:56,159 --> 01:27:58,439
parts for automobiles

1765
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:03,179
and blessed that i learned from that and
i put this into a nineteen ninety-four

1766
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:06,449
uh... lecture to the are

1767
01:28:06,449 --> 01:28:11,730
association of wall intel within
specialises something like that in find

1768
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,110
it

1769
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:14,219
but looking for stealing taxi

1770
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:18,469
uh... a_t_f_ site alm the less than i
learn from that as you have to cast a

1771
01:28:18,469 --> 01:28:20,000
very wide net

1772
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,020
and he can't cast a very wide secret man
industrial espionage is generally not

1773
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,280
worth it

1774
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,050
and i was just doing some browsing uh...
and there's an article in the economist

1775
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:30,919
in which

1776
01:28:30,919 --> 01:28:34,119
uh... all u_s_ another manufactures were
asked where did they think the

1777
01:28:34,119 --> 01:28:35,809
renovation was going to come from

1778
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:39,550
by the year twenty uh... twenty twelve
twenty thirteen

1779
01:28:39,550 --> 01:28:44,139
and just like business week had a
wonderful cover story in june of two

1780
01:28:44,139 --> 01:28:46,989
thousand and five i think there was a
twenty th of june

1781
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:50,520
but haven't had a cover story called the
power of us

1782
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,710
llego got a thousand six hundred
engineering hours free from its

1783
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:56,090
customers

1784
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:59,510
from from devoted customers who said
that

1785
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:03,939
what we really need is something that
does this

1786
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:06,250
anyhow that's that's money in the day

1787
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:08,910
uh... generals any and i've written

1788
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:13,530
if you if you don't know s s dot mat at
the very top you'll see some cellmark

1789
01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:14,730
shortcuts

1790
01:29:14,730 --> 01:29:17,730
and i've written the to sum up chapters
on those sent

1791
01:29:17,730 --> 01:29:22,260
of one of the strategic level one of the
uh... operational level

1792
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:27,199
and at the strategic level i quote
general tony zinnia marine who was the

1793
01:29:27,199 --> 01:29:29,250
commander in chief of uh... uh...

1794
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:32,260
centcom right before the bush
administration

1795
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:38,389
zinnie as hyatt many others was
violently opposed to invading iraq

1796
01:29:38,389 --> 01:29:42,550
and he is on record as saying that as
commander in chief only four percent of

1797
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:45,800
his information came from secret sources
and methods

1798
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:48,210
eighty percent came from open sources

1799
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:52,739
and the other sixteen percent if he knew
where to look meaning which coalition

1800
01:29:52,739 --> 01:29:54,199
partner to ask

1801
01:29:54,199 --> 01:29:58,790
came from open source is in direct
contact with cocaine agree literature

1802
01:29:58,790 --> 01:30:02,609
so industrial espionage in my view

1803
01:30:02,609 --> 01:30:05,440
is a massive waste of time

1804
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,099
most of the time

1805
01:30:07,099 --> 01:30:13,310
there may be locations when it pays off
but the the overall cost risk timeline

1806
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:15,369
know that really is worth it

1807
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:19,889
and i've written an article for forbes
uh... a sap book called uh... the

1808
01:30:19,889 --> 01:30:22,709
funeral with so-called reinventing
intelligence

1809
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:27,139
and i make the point that u_s_ secret
intelligence is inside and outside out

1810
01:30:27,139 --> 01:30:28,209
bom

1811
01:30:28,209 --> 01:30:33,438
it's inside out because we tried to
answer questions by stealing

1812
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:34,850
unilaterally

1813
01:30:34,850 --> 01:30:38,639
rather than beginning with what does
everybody else already know

1814
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:43,460
and it's upside down because we we
relying on satellites taking pictures i

1815
01:30:43,460 --> 01:30:45,559
mean in height c_n_n_ cuba

1816
01:30:45,559 --> 01:30:49,439
we would use satellites to take pictures
of the boats being built on the beaches

1817
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:53,149
rather than sending someone down there
with a digital camera

1818
01:30:53,149 --> 01:30:54,040
uh...

1819
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:57,349
that makes no sense at all in effect
satellites are often wrong

1820
01:30:57,349 --> 01:31:00,979
uh... turns out satellites could not
predict a temperature on the grounds

1821
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:04,219
because they were created to average the
temperatures in the different levels of

1822
01:31:04,219 --> 01:31:05,489
atmosphere

1823
01:31:05,489 --> 01:31:09,060
sodium on the ground is vastly superior
to the satellite when it comes to tell

1824
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:11,719
you what the ground temperatures that
day

1825
01:31:11,719 --> 01:31:12,760
uh...

1826
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:15,949
and other spy question

1827
01:31:15,949 --> 01:31:19,609
all right scott ritter submarine
certainly better than ollie north

1828
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:22,010
on

1829
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:28,669
scott

1830
01:31:28,669 --> 01:31:30,789
uh... we have a case

1831
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:35,449
alright alright i apologize we kind of
data may change here and and uh... and

1832
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:38,710
that's wrong right scott ritter is a
good guy how many of you very

1833
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:39,840
mike's

1834
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,630
from now on if someone's not at the
might so you can shout out that if

1835
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:48,110
someone is at the micro precedents ok
someone at the might

1836
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:51,079
uh... and other personal items online
beginning

1837
01:31:51,079 --> 01:31:54,889
uh... about two of the financial
situation of u_s_ but after heaven isn't

1838
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:57,809
enough for about half an hour i'm really
wondering

1839
01:31:57,809 --> 01:32:00,679
to get back to the report why aren't you
as you know

1840
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:04,509
the americans not writing in the streets
seven dead appropriate action in twelve

1841
01:32:04,509 --> 01:32:05,639
years here

1842
01:32:05,639 --> 01:32:10,339
currencies in the crap you're into
illegal wars

1843
01:32:10,339 --> 01:32:12,530
it's of what's going on here

1844
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:16,780
it's it's it's an absolutely as it may
be the question of our time

1845
01:32:16,780 --> 01:32:20,608
well it's an absolute central question
and

1846
01:32:20,609 --> 01:32:24,579
ideology break it down by category

1847
01:32:24,579 --> 01:32:30,409
at the mass card debts the the large
blue collar

1848
01:32:30,409 --> 01:32:31,969
white population

1849
01:32:31,969 --> 01:32:37,050
uh... that is has been one over by the
republican extremists

1850
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,850
on their entire world view

1851
01:32:39,850 --> 01:32:43,820
is based on talk radio and i will go
back to before nine eleven

1852
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,620
before nine eleven their work

1853
01:32:45,620 --> 01:32:49,480
there were senators and congressmen who
bragged that they did not need a u_s_

1854
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:52,610
passport because nothing that happened
overseas mattered to their constituents

1855
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,699
at home

1856
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:58,780
that was the american perspective at the
so-called elite level

1857
01:32:58,780 --> 01:32:59,780
on

1858
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:01,398
at the same time

1859
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:05,599
the american elite now relies on
corporations

1860
01:33:05,599 --> 01:33:07,440
which basically consider

1861
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,130
national governments to be annoyances

1862
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:13,040
uh... to be worked around and so

1863
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:16,899
were not inconvenience ng anyone on wall
street by being stupid

1864
01:33:16,899 --> 01:33:20,849
uh... in fact there's there's uh...
there's a body of literature merging

1865
01:33:20,849 --> 01:33:24,230
that says that wall street is known for
the last ten years

1866
01:33:24,230 --> 01:33:26,359
that we're heading toward a depression

1867
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:30,000
and the smart money in the hedge funds
has been betting short

1868
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:33,770
and has basically been betting on the
u_s_ collapsing and becoming a third

1869
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:38,270
world country and they've been building
up their alternative sites in dubai and

1870
01:33:38,270 --> 01:33:42,309
singapore in elsewhere malaysia's being
been very popular

1871
01:33:42,309 --> 01:33:44,130
on

1872
01:33:44,130 --> 01:33:47,480
all i can say is i think that

1873
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:50,959
a form of opium of the people has been
achieved

1874
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:52,599
in the united states

1875
01:33:52,599 --> 01:33:53,980
and

1876
01:33:53,980 --> 01:33:58,659
you know most americans don't realize
that what we see on c_n_n_ a ship

1877
01:33:58,659 --> 01:33:59,960
uh...

1878
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:03,570
you know i was a wonderful book called
fog facts it's about things that kind of

1879
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:05,599
her known but not known

1880
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:06,710
song

1881
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:10,889
among us among people they've read in
carer it's known that there were nine

1882
01:34:10,889 --> 01:34:14,369
hundred and thirty-five wise it's known
that there were twenty five

1883
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:18,119
high crimes and misdemeanors and despite
its cartoon cover the book weapons of

1884
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:21,598
mass destruction is a very important
book uh... very useful

1885
01:34:21,599 --> 01:34:23,099
serious book

1886
01:34:23,099 --> 01:34:26,780
alm

1887
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:30,249
in some ways i go back to the thought
that i had about ten years ago which is

1888
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:31,989
it's time for europe

1889
01:34:31,989 --> 01:34:36,420
and the southern hemisphere creative
ways to america

1890
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:39,810
uh... ten cents at san dot com i was
endure

1891
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:40,989
last week where

1892
01:34:40,989 --> 01:34:43,030
lived most of my work on us

1893
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:46,429
having a strategy sessions part of my
job with a bunch of the bankers from

1894
01:34:46,429 --> 01:34:48,459
germany the netherlands switzerland

1895
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:49,849
alone them

1896
01:34:49,849 --> 01:34:53,380
after having done us informal basis over
bunch beers

1897
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:57,019
even discussing of course the dollar
which is that the hitting them to do

1898
01:34:57,019 --> 01:35:00,889
and for the first time because i'd do
talk to bankers but to three times a

1899
01:35:00,889 --> 01:35:05,159
year over the last decade for the first
time table basically admitted to be at a

1900
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:08,630
personal level at all of their banks
were quietly getting out of the dollar

1901
01:35:08,630 --> 01:35:11,139
because they all had way too many of
them and they were

1902
01:35:11,139 --> 01:35:12,899
drop in value over time

1903
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:16,250
and so we were you know we're all saying
we'll look at this

1904
01:35:16,250 --> 01:35:20,269
america can't you know get its own house
in order through whatever means you just

1905
01:35:20,269 --> 01:35:22,440
through a proper election

1906
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,250
you know burning some tires mysteries
are wet whatever is required and maybe

1907
01:35:26,250 --> 01:35:29,289
you know you're concerned a need to pull
the plug on the same

1908
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:34,129
and prevents iran from being it that way
because i've

1909
01:35:34,129 --> 01:35:37,949
prevent iran from being attacked a new
kids now right that's that's that's very

1910
01:35:37,949 --> 01:35:40,149
nice it is actually two parts

1911
01:35:40,149 --> 01:35:42,539
alm first off

1912
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:45,478
pulling the plug

1913
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:49,110
do you actually i like the idea pulling
the plug but the thing is if china pulls

1914
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:53,639
the plug on the u_s_ wal-mart collapses
and so does most of the chinese cottage

1915
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:54,729
industry

1916
01:35:54,729 --> 01:36:00,489
palm what people don't realize is that
china has massive problems all these

1917
01:36:00,489 --> 01:36:04,439
investors of one of the china was shiny
eyes and you know all the sweatshop

1918
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:07,409
thing and school kids making explosives
and stuff

1919
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:11,119
all of their starting to realize that
not only other factories not getting

1920
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:12,780
reliable energy

1921
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:14,969
they now running out of water

1922
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:18,599
and so all whole bunch of these
so-called investments in china are now

1923
01:36:18,599 --> 01:36:19,849
at risk

1924
01:36:19,849 --> 01:36:24,090
on saw on the one hand china had not
only cannot pull the plug

1925
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:28,129
from what i've heard a modern economists
or financial restricting like that

1926
01:36:28,129 --> 01:36:33,929
but second china has a vested interest
in keeping us afloat i understand that

1927
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:38,339
that some of the wall street houses were
able to at least one of them was able to

1928
01:36:38,339 --> 01:36:42,050
call the prime minister trying to get a
six billion dollar loan overnight on his

1929
01:36:42,050 --> 01:36:42,959
word

1930
01:36:42,959 --> 01:36:44,209
uh...

1931
01:36:44,209 --> 01:36:48,030
and so there's a vested interest there
kind of keeping the place table part of

1932
01:36:48,030 --> 01:36:49,068
the problem

1933
01:36:49,069 --> 01:36:53,869
with information hero stuff particularly
when it's based on financial derivatives

1934
01:36:53,869 --> 01:36:55,329
that are all fluff

1935
01:36:55,329 --> 01:36:57,920
is that it doesn't degrade gracefully

1936
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,510
it crashes

1937
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:04,030
is there's no graceful degradation it's
on arts off and then so i'm very very

1938
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:06,259
very concerned right now

1939
01:37:06,260 --> 01:37:07,429
long

1940
01:37:07,429 --> 01:37:11,499
and if we have if we have a come
consolidated multi which is looks like

1941
01:37:11,499 --> 01:37:13,309
we're creeping away from

1942
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:17,560
uh... and it's gonna be bad and one of
the things that people don't realize

1943
01:37:17,560 --> 01:37:19,639
about all these foreclosures

1944
01:37:19,639 --> 01:37:24,599
is it created places were vague rents
could go and criminals to go on drug

1945
01:37:24,599 --> 01:37:25,860
users could go

1946
01:37:25,860 --> 01:37:30,769
and cleveland had to do we really raise
eleven thousand houses to the ground

1947
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:33,619
now let's go to a rock

1948
01:37:33,619 --> 01:37:35,419
hong

1949
01:37:35,419 --> 01:37:39,519
there been a couple of things under the
wire n and again the chinese bright

1950
01:37:39,519 --> 01:37:41,300
cheney down over singapore

1951
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:44,100
what i think the american public doesn't
realize it's a

1952
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:48,499
prolly around eleven forty five oh one
forty five something like that

1953
01:37:48,499 --> 01:37:49,449
uh... okay

1954
01:37:49,449 --> 01:37:53,409
i mean i lost opportunity and then
anyone wants the state can come closer

1955
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:55,539
and will turn up the lights and stuff
for whatever

1956
01:37:55,539 --> 01:37:57,559
but no

1957
01:37:57,559 --> 01:37:59,290
china

1958
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:03,260
can now papa submarine up behind the
u_s_ carrier protected by an entire

1959
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:06,139
carrier group in his nothing we can do
about it

1960
01:38:06,139 --> 01:38:09,869
and they did that as a demonstration

1961
01:38:09,869 --> 01:38:14,199
which i need to know neutralize niamh
speculating here but i believe this is

1962
01:38:14,199 --> 01:38:17,469
true china kanan not relies any weapon
system

1963
01:38:17,469 --> 01:38:22,380
anne mobility system that that we have
with a lot dramatic pause is in fact

1964
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:25,709
you can kill people inside of a tank
just by putting in certain kinds of

1965
01:38:25,709 --> 01:38:27,019
pulse place

1966
01:38:27,019 --> 01:38:29,630
it fries the rest of the side of the
tank

1967
01:38:29,630 --> 01:38:32,289
uh... without having to penetrate the
whole

1968
01:38:32,289 --> 01:38:33,429
on

1969
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:34,920
at the same time

1970
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:39,479
there have been some death threats
against secretary of treasury paulson

1971
01:38:39,479 --> 01:38:40,969
and uh...

1972
01:38:40,969 --> 01:38:45,330
and i think the behind the scenes the
russians and others

1973
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:48,309
are basically making it personal now

1974
01:38:48,309 --> 01:38:51,119
and i believe i speculate

1975
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:52,358
that

1976
01:38:52,359 --> 01:38:56,109
wholesome and several others have
basically been told that if they don't

1977
01:38:56,109 --> 01:38:58,860
get their shit together they're gonna
end up

1978
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:02,070
as a head on some worse is uh... strong

1979
01:39:02,070 --> 01:39:05,400
arm

1980
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:09,059
i'd react i think he has i think he's an
honorable man but you don't know what

1981
01:39:09,059 --> 01:39:10,090
you don't know

1982
01:39:10,090 --> 01:39:13,599
on and i think we've made a key

1983
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:17,019
yet we've made a huge mistake and
turning the treasurer of the goldman

1984
01:39:17,019 --> 01:39:20,959
sachs and we've also made a huge mistake
and allowing the federal reserve to be a

1985
01:39:20,959 --> 01:39:23,099
substitute for the u_s_ treasury

1986
01:39:23,099 --> 01:39:26,179
federal reserve is not part of the u_s_
government

1987
01:39:26,179 --> 01:39:28,409
called nxp idiocy

1988
01:39:28,409 --> 01:39:31,090
to think that they're gonna regulate
anything

1989
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:34,090
palm so i don't have an answer for you

1990
01:39:34,090 --> 01:39:39,050
are other than to say that idon't think
organ attacked iran but our biggest

1991
01:39:39,050 --> 01:39:41,289
problem right now is israel

1992
01:39:41,289 --> 01:39:44,978
israel has made it clear that they will
attack or a no matter what we do and

1993
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:49,280
dick cheney is on record as telling
israel that before

1994
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:54,070
the inauguration and after the election
we will attack around no matter what

1995
01:39:54,070 --> 01:39:59,989
of that i think people director is an
active anti uh... attack arron movement

1996
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:04,629
or i think people just need to be really
elevate this uncomfortable fold wants

1997
01:40:04,629 --> 01:40:05,858
full twice

1998
01:40:05,859 --> 01:40:09,609
uh... we were full by iraq and we
certainly should be fooled by iran

1999
01:40:09,609 --> 01:40:14,420
on nuclear powers of very reasonable
thoughtful option for run to be pursuing

2000
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:18,480
and frankly nuclear war is also

2001
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,659
obama the main reason i have turned
against obama is because all of his

2002
01:40:22,659 --> 01:40:26,899
foreign policy knowledge comes from
doctors a big reasons t

2003
01:40:26,899 --> 01:40:30,849
brzezinski was a great strategist in his
time

2004
01:40:30,849 --> 01:40:33,869
he is now out to pasture and over the
top

2005
01:40:33,869 --> 01:40:36,409
uh... brzezinski is a poll

2006
01:40:36,409 --> 01:40:40,439
he has one last war with russia left and
and he's delusional and thinking he

2007
01:40:40,439 --> 01:40:43,999
could push the chinese back from africa
and latin america

2008
01:40:43,999 --> 01:40:46,119
as far as i'm concerned

2009
01:40:46,119 --> 01:40:50,459
barackobama has not learned how to find
good advisors he has three hundred

2010
01:40:50,459 --> 01:40:52,920
foreign policy advisers but

2011
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:54,520
obviously i'm not one of them

2012
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,349
on or what i want to be

2013
01:40:56,349 --> 01:40:58,530
palm

2014
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:03,360
is taking a bit but uh... you know the
reality is we we really need to make it

2015
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,909
there relevant who gets elected

2016
01:41:05,909 --> 01:41:07,869
we need to get back in the game here

2017
01:41:07,869 --> 01:41:10,920
it's no longer game it's about the
future of our kids

2018
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:14,139
uh... please if you have a follow up
otherwise i'll go to him in the let's

2019
01:41:14,139 --> 01:41:17,869
not more afterwards i will certainly
could not have a couple of diet sodas

2020
01:41:17,869 --> 01:41:22,070
uh... before i go to bed again up with
my questions revolve but

2021
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:26,090
you briefly spoke a at hope number six
about you worked on doing remote enemy

2022
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:27,480
i_d_ detonation

2023
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:31,310
as one of the review that raid on them
more well there is a report on our

2024
01:41:31,310 --> 01:41:35,299
website on uh... we get a ninety
detonation survey

2025
01:41:35,299 --> 01:41:38,969
on and one of the things we found that
was pretty fascinating was that the

2026
01:41:38,969 --> 01:41:42,379
chinese cellular industry is really
exploding

2027
01:41:42,379 --> 01:41:44,829
on

2028
01:41:44,829 --> 01:41:46,108
yeah

2029
01:41:46,109 --> 01:41:47,949
staff here

2030
01:41:47,949 --> 01:41:49,730
unintended whatever

2031
01:41:49,730 --> 01:41:55,610
uh... and their argue it's not possible
to buy a base camp

2032
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:59,989
that is landline connected and that has
all these cells that can be activated

2033
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:04,080
on i have not come up to date with its
sense than on

2034
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:07,199
the whole concept of acid metric warfare

2035
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:11,139
is one that the u_s_ was extremely slow
to understand

2036
01:42:11,139 --> 01:42:15,909
all for the price of a cup of tea i
could have told them

2037
01:42:15,909 --> 01:42:19,639
we have learned over and over again both
the british and american empires that

2038
01:42:19,639 --> 01:42:22,919
the big war force doesn't know how to do
small war

2039
01:42:22,919 --> 01:42:27,699
and by the time of learns to two five
years later it can no longer do big war

2040
01:42:27,699 --> 01:42:32,199
generation seki was absolutely correct
when he said

2041
01:42:32,199 --> 01:42:35,689
we don't want to do it but if you want
to do a rock we can do it we have to do

2042
01:42:35,689 --> 01:42:39,050
it right it needs four hundred thousand
people so that they want loopy armories

2043
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:40,460
to get their heidi

2044
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:43,980
materials they won't look the ministry
so that we can restore business

2045
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:47,300
we should not dismantle the army in the
police you know so on

2046
01:42:47,300 --> 01:42:51,959
but go back to brzezinski he's the guy
who gave pakistan the nuclear bomb

2047
01:42:51,959 --> 01:42:55,589
he's the guy who told pakistan you get a
complete buy from us we're not gonna

2048
01:42:55,589 --> 01:43:00,469
force proliferation standards as long as
you help us with afghanistan

2049
01:43:00,469 --> 01:43:03,010
now pakistan assuming

2050
01:43:03,010 --> 01:43:05,030
around a shiite

2051
01:43:05,030 --> 01:43:08,108
okay geraniums aren't afraid of us

2052
01:43:08,109 --> 01:43:11,199
lay in the chinese already know about it
kicked our ass in the iranians are

2053
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:15,559
brilliant i mean they used ahmed salah p
as an acid of influences but fired by

2054
01:43:15,559 --> 01:43:18,039
the c_i_a_ for lying and stealing

2055
01:43:18,039 --> 01:43:22,559
all they used him except four sweet
nothings in the dick cheney's here

2056
01:43:22,559 --> 01:43:26,459
and they got the u_s_ taxpayer to pay
for the toppling of their two greatest

2057
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:29,610
threats

2058
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:31,739
you know this is a ragged

2059
01:43:31,739 --> 01:43:33,380
this is a persian with

2060
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:36,339
six hundred years of intelligence in
them

2061
01:43:36,339 --> 01:43:37,210
palm

2062
01:43:37,210 --> 01:43:39,229
iranians are not afraid of us

2063
01:43:39,229 --> 01:43:43,570
dirt deathly afraid of saudi arabian
pakistan and the rest of the city's

2064
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:47,679
okay and and and for us to have a
government that doesn't understand that

2065
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:50,170
is is is frightening i mean

2066
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:52,050
condi rice is frightening

2067
01:43:52,050 --> 01:43:52,980
uh...

2068
01:43:52,980 --> 01:43:54,709
and many many ways

2069
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:58,380
okay and other question sharethis dot

2070
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:01,369
presumably over the next couple hundred
years are going to get really good

2071
01:44:01,369 --> 01:44:03,389
internet modifications

2072
01:44:03,389 --> 01:44:08,209
and parents if they wanted his recent
martyr collar faster metabolize things

2073
01:44:08,209 --> 01:44:09,589
faster whatever

2074
01:44:09,589 --> 01:44:12,019
and it may be companies will start
marketing to them

2075
01:44:12,019 --> 01:44:15,719
i'm just curious as to how you think
this will claim to capitalism in

2076
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:17,379
politics

2077
01:44:17,379 --> 01:44:19,219
interesting question thank you

2078
01:44:19,219 --> 01:44:20,670
palm

2079
01:44:20,670 --> 01:44:23,250
if i've learned one thing

2080
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:24,939
in the last

2081
01:44:24,939 --> 01:44:30,409
ten years of the salary of your greeting
it's a diversity is absolutely the

2082
01:44:30,409 --> 01:44:34,099
essential foundation for revolution

2083
01:44:34,099 --> 01:44:38,159
and that contrived diversity

2084
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:42,650
is shortly going to give use popped up
that kid is you ever want to

2085
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:45,219
the

2086
01:44:45,219 --> 01:44:46,159
so

2087
01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:50,329
capitalism a well go toward marketing
kids

2088
01:44:50,329 --> 01:44:52,670
uh...

2089
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:55,639
and cloning kids and things like that

2090
01:44:55,639 --> 01:44:59,709
uh... but i am hopeful one of the
reasons i've committed the rest of my

2091
01:44:59,709 --> 01:45:02,880
life to be intelligence officers of the
poor

2092
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:05,440
and the creating the world brain

2093
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:09,780
is because i believe that the future of
the planet lives among the poor and the

2094
01:45:09,780 --> 01:45:12,050
diversity that they can bring

2095
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:14,420
uh... it frost my ass

2096
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:18,099
that my kids are like third-generation
rich

2097
01:45:18,099 --> 01:45:21,429
don't want to have a job and i can no
longer beat them

2098
01:45:21,429 --> 01:45:27,690
laws can't so i go to a supermarket and
i see a vietnamese kid that's not only a

2099
01:45:27,690 --> 01:45:28,909
bad here

2100
01:45:28,909 --> 01:45:33,239
their house so their ass off to try and
do everybody else's job too

2101
01:45:33,239 --> 01:45:35,439
okay novak's

2102
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:37,289
how you get innovation

2103
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:38,539
palm

2104
01:45:38,539 --> 01:45:41,239
sold my sense is that

2105
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:45,590
genetics in capitalism are very very
interesting but but uh... a locked in a

2106
01:45:45,590 --> 01:45:49,349
circle around it is if if if you could
last another fifteen minutes i'd be glad

2107
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:50,929
to take this on

2108
01:45:50,929 --> 01:45:55,979
face-to-face in a smaller circle or
whatever on

2109
01:45:55,979 --> 01:45:59,909
jim telford second book on n_s_a_ called
body of secrets he he spent the whole

2110
01:45:59,909 --> 01:46:03,879
book talking about how n_s_a_ has spent
close to a trillion dollars or i mean a

2111
01:46:03,879 --> 01:46:07,669
lot a lot of money on trying to create
all the super computers and all the

2112
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:08,610
stuff

2113
01:46:08,610 --> 01:46:10,369
and they haven't succeeded

2114
01:46:10,369 --> 01:46:14,999
i mean today were processing less than a
million out of billions of messages

2115
01:46:14,999 --> 01:46:17,030
pauline generally late

2116
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:20,409
and we don't speak the hundred and
eighty two of the hundred maybe three

2117
01:46:20,409 --> 01:46:22,549
languages we need

2118
01:46:22,549 --> 01:46:23,909
doing the math there

2119
01:46:23,909 --> 01:46:28,570
um... and uh... so i mean and i say as a
joke in a lot of ways

2120
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:33,379
uh... eighty percent of signals
intelligence is pattern analysis

2121
01:46:33,379 --> 01:46:34,280
content

2122
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,329
d christian and understanding

2123
01:46:36,329 --> 01:46:39,549
it's vastly more important and steve
emerson is already done this in a book

2124
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:42,329
called american she hides fastened were
born in l

2125
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:45,639
that they're fifty five specific places
around the united states

2126
01:46:45,639 --> 01:46:49,389
where the community is conducive to
terrorist being invisible

2127
01:46:49,389 --> 01:46:54,189
this is not rocket science and so you
can basically haven't overt overlay on

2128
01:46:54,189 --> 01:46:55,189
that place

2129
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:56,179
but jim

2130
01:46:56,179 --> 01:46:59,239
at the end of his book the last
paragraph talks about after talking

2131
01:46:59,239 --> 01:47:02,649
about all the nazis failures to to
achieve nirvana

2132
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:07,269
he says one day and i say may achieve
the ultimately computing inmate she is a

2133
01:47:07,269 --> 01:47:09,429
small hand-held computer

2134
01:47:09,429 --> 01:47:13,099
that runs on virtually no energy that
can do better for calculations for

2135
01:47:13,099 --> 01:47:14,409
nanosecond

2136
01:47:14,409 --> 01:47:15,560
and colin

2137
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:20,929
and the last three words in this book or
v human

2138
01:47:20,929 --> 01:47:25,909
so i believe that our future machine
learning is vastly oversold

2139
01:47:25,909 --> 01:47:32,460
contractors big pharma genetics genome
mapping all this is vastly oversold

2140
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:35,929
what we need to do is get back in the
business of being humanity

2141
01:47:35,929 --> 01:47:39,139
uh... back in the business of sharing
information

2142
01:47:39,139 --> 01:47:42,439
uh... alvin toffler who became a friend
after wrote chapter in the future

2143
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:46,569
despite called me the rival store and i
guess i've turned out to be that

2144
01:47:46,569 --> 01:47:48,480
on

2145
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:52,199
he said that the the magic of
information is that you can share it and

2146
01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:53,609
still have it

2147
01:47:53,609 --> 01:47:56,379
where's the tangible property that's not
the case

2148
01:47:56,379 --> 01:47:59,789
and your card bank when others have
persuaded me that we can create infinite

2149
01:47:59,789 --> 01:48:00,690
wealth

2150
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:03,130
was a book by barry carter called
infinite wealth

2151
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:06,219
toll for certain revolutionary wealthy
opec tank was written wealth of nations

2152
01:48:06,219 --> 01:48:08,559
uh... wealth of networks

2153
01:48:08,559 --> 01:48:12,270
so uh... thomas toward has written the
wealth of knowledge

2154
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:14,010
cassia trend here

2155
01:48:14,010 --> 01:48:16,270
okay nine actually convinced

2156
01:48:16,270 --> 01:48:19,139
we can do what buckminster fuller wanted
us to do

2157
01:48:19,139 --> 01:48:20,719
and the first place

2158
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:24,919
on and that is create an operating
manual for spaceship earth

2159
01:48:24,919 --> 01:48:28,170
that the chinese will say hey we need
one of those

2160
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:31,860
and have them adopted enhance it and and
go for

2161
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,829
saw come back to you later if you want
over here

2162
01:48:34,829 --> 01:48:38,709
uh... i would love to see question might
shift gears for a second i'm sure you

2163
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:42,330
look back into the pictures you always
brilliantly

2164
01:48:42,330 --> 01:48:43,650
what is on the

2165
01:48:43,650 --> 01:48:46,989
me from what is the and game

2166
01:48:46,989 --> 01:48:49,189
four the war on drugs

2167
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:53,349
and that the short story the multi into
that is i was on the prison camp this

2168
01:48:53,349 --> 01:48:55,019
forest will meeting actually

2169
01:48:55,019 --> 01:48:59,869
images bumped into dr west cornel west
out yeah i like an ass supposedly

2170
01:48:59,869 --> 01:49:03,139
because he was actually talking about
prisons and the prison complex right saw

2171
01:49:03,139 --> 01:49:04,570
the end of his talk

2172
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:08,169
anticipate or is the is the answer

2173
01:49:08,169 --> 01:49:11,449
for the drug war is the answer in the
minority community because they have the

2174
01:49:11,449 --> 01:49:15,030
most to litigate flocked hardest because
the drug war

2175
01:49:15,030 --> 01:49:16,429
and he actually said you know

2176
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:18,239
i wish it were

2177
01:49:18,239 --> 01:49:22,549
they had there the committee that's been
hurt so badly and every preacher rallies

2178
01:49:22,549 --> 01:49:26,659
against the evils of substance and self
medication the answer cannot come from

2179
01:49:26,659 --> 01:49:29,949
us do you do you come to that notion or
do you not

2180
01:49:29,949 --> 01:49:34,809
how how does the drug war and if it ever
ten and how does it all play into us

2181
01:49:34,809 --> 01:49:41,809
moving the ball for cats so that's
that's absolutely over twice

2182
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,739
first off his book democracy matters

2183
01:49:45,739 --> 01:49:48,679
is one that i consider to be nobel level

2184
01:49:48,679 --> 01:49:50,119
material

2185
01:49:50,119 --> 01:49:55,190
and won the dairies larry summers for
ever saddam white fuck

2186
01:49:55,190 --> 01:49:57,109
alone

2187
01:49:57,109 --> 01:49:59,299
uh... it's an excellent book

2188
01:49:59,299 --> 01:50:01,280
and i tried to summarize

2189
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:04,949
uh... to the best of my ability and
uh...

2190
01:50:04,949 --> 01:50:09,379
i think cornel west is uh... is that as
a man whose whose one of the essential

2191
01:50:09,379 --> 01:50:13,699
thinkers of our time vertically
relational to the people of color

2192
01:50:13,699 --> 01:50:14,520
uh...

2193
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,330
other books that will help you
understand people color include the

2194
01:50:17,330 --> 01:50:20,980
uh... book off the books the underground
economy

2195
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:24,949
on your good comedy it's it's a lovely
book about bartering and what really

2196
01:50:24,949 --> 01:50:29,670
poor people to treat meals or
babysitting for like mechanics on their

2197
01:50:29,670 --> 01:50:30,629
car

2198
01:50:30,629 --> 01:50:32,149
stuff like that

2199
01:50:32,149 --> 01:50:37,159
uh... i i was approached by the producer
of uh... the last great hope

2200
01:50:37,159 --> 01:50:39,060
uh... wonderful dvd

2201
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:41,409
on the drug war

2202
01:50:41,409 --> 01:50:45,980
and i was very glad to volunteer he paid
my expenses and i went out to los

2203
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:49,139
angeles and and it was kind of fun i
mean

2204
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:52,749
even though i was only film in a garage
it was like movie stars stuff in the sky

2205
01:50:52,749 --> 01:50:55,688
was a real professional he did
everything perfectly

2206
01:50:55,689 --> 01:50:59,510
well and i think in the outtakes all of
my remarks are still on record online

2207
01:50:59,510 --> 01:51:06,510
not just the stuff to be he used in the
in the dvd

2208
01:51:06,839 --> 01:51:09,650
america should inherently be

2209
01:51:09,650 --> 01:51:11,110
the

2210
01:51:11,110 --> 01:51:13,289
he made sure

2211
01:51:13,289 --> 01:51:15,959
that provides fights constitution

2212
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:19,719
uh... a nation that was and he really
intended to be christian

2213
01:51:19,719 --> 01:51:24,809
uh... analogous stand the spanish he
dicks of expulsion

2214
01:51:24,809 --> 01:51:26,980
uh... because is slum

2215
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:29,859
and wandering around here but i'm coming
back to this

2216
01:51:29,859 --> 01:51:31,629
islam

2217
01:51:31,629 --> 01:51:34,769
is inherently and entirely

2218
01:51:34,769 --> 01:51:37,079
governance religion

2219
01:51:37,079 --> 01:51:40,040
it's it's our religion that that

2220
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,459
at its best

2221
01:51:41,459 --> 01:51:45,570
believes that states should take second
place and israel unfortunately has the

2222
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:46,969
same problem

2223
01:51:46,969 --> 01:51:50,050
i mean a stroke of a demonic deal with
its rabbis

2224
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:50,900
uh...

2225
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:55,020
after use terrorism to drive the british
out of palestine

2226
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,130
and

2227
01:51:56,130 --> 01:51:58,369
the israelis are still delusional

2228
01:51:58,369 --> 01:51:59,659
about

2229
01:51:59,659 --> 01:52:02,369
there was nobody there when they got
there they turned the desert into an

2230
01:52:02,369 --> 01:52:04,519
oasis that's all bullshit

2231
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:08,639
of the israelis is stealing arrow water
from the arab aquifers with long

2232
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:10,199
underground pipes

2233
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:13,669
and the really agricultural industry

2234
01:52:13,669 --> 01:52:17,799
respond is responsible for three percent
of israel's g_d_p_ is using fifty

2235
01:52:17,799 --> 01:52:19,909
percent of the middle east from water

2236
01:52:19,909 --> 01:52:21,560
appearances knots

2237
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:25,900
but coming back to this whole thing
about black people its details like that

2238
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:30,469
that have to come into the into the
consciousness

2239
01:52:30,469 --> 01:52:34,049
i don't know how you shame the american
people i have come to the conclusion

2240
01:52:34,049 --> 01:52:37,309
that we need several true three
conciliation commissions

2241
01:52:37,309 --> 01:52:41,030
on and i hope that week one u_n_ nelson
mandela don't die

2242
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:44,790
before and unlike the president is able
to ask for their help

2243
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:47,019
on i'd like nelson mandela

2244
01:52:47,020 --> 01:52:51,070
to cheer patriots reconciling issue
commission on everything that the u_s_

2245
01:52:51,070 --> 01:52:53,170
has done for the rest of the world

2246
01:52:53,170 --> 01:52:57,969
content

2247
01:52:57,969 --> 01:53:02,360
and i would like to lee kwan yu to cheer
a truth and reconciliation commission

2248
01:53:02,360 --> 01:53:04,739
everything we have done to our own
people

2249
01:53:04,739 --> 01:53:10,460
citizen heritage the usual since it

2250
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:15,110
i lived overseas and so i i really never
had a prejudice bone in my body when i

2251
01:53:15,110 --> 01:53:16,499
came back

2252
01:53:16,499 --> 01:53:19,599
but when i went into a marine corps
school i'm dave for training the first

2253
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:22,989
thing i learned in the sergeants were
very very focused on this because the

2254
01:53:22,989 --> 01:53:24,489
other kids had not been

2255
01:53:24,489 --> 01:53:26,399
uh... oversees all their lives

2256
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:30,559
he said we have only one color marine we
have only green marines

2257
01:53:30,559 --> 01:53:33,480
we have dark green drinks we have like
green lines

2258
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,339
we have only one color blind

2259
01:53:35,339 --> 01:53:38,349
and and that's the metaphor by which we
should look like just like when

2260
01:53:38,349 --> 01:53:41,839
eisenhower cut off the plane and he was
asked by marshall everybody wants an are

2261
01:53:41,839 --> 01:53:46,280
you a democrat or republican eyes and
said i'm an american

2262
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:47,880
okay i think we need to kill

2263
01:53:47,880 --> 01:53:54,809
both political parties it

2264
01:53:54,809 --> 01:53:56,730
d the democratic

2265
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:58,699
and republican

2266
01:53:58,699 --> 01:54:01,440
uh... political party leadership

2267
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:07,900
is just as bad for america as the
vatican mafia wall street leadership

2268
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:11,760
long and the only way working at this
place them in here i returned the book

2269
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,280
monster for the only way we're gonna
displaced in this by recognizing the

2270
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:16,669
fuller had it right

2271
01:54:16,669 --> 01:54:19,689
you don't try and fix a system that's
broken you create a new system that

2272
01:54:19,689 --> 01:54:21,210
displaces

2273
01:54:21,210 --> 01:54:25,340
and the way we self governance by using
the internet by using status and wisdom

2274
01:54:25,340 --> 01:54:27,719
councils which we discussed and jim
profs for

2275
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:28,960
the societies

2276
01:54:28,960 --> 01:54:29,929
breakthrough

2277
01:54:29,929 --> 01:54:33,469
by reading tom at least that's how the
mock received by reading all rise

2278
01:54:33,469 --> 01:54:37,920
dignity in the future by reading
escaping the matrix by reading the

2279
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:39,719
cultural creatives

2280
01:54:39,719 --> 01:54:42,769
on beard enormous number of books out
there

2281
01:54:42,769 --> 01:54:48,090
the bottom line is we've got to stop
being uh...

2282
01:54:48,090 --> 01:54:49,459
bystanders

2283
01:54:49,459 --> 01:54:51,349
uh... we've got to start

2284
01:54:51,349 --> 01:54:56,159
focusing on the fact that there is a
prisons slave industry in this country

2285
01:54:56,159 --> 01:55:00,639
is also a former hospital industry is
also a military industrial complex is

2286
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:01,519
also

2287
01:55:01,519 --> 01:55:04,150
a secret intelligence complex where

2288
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:08,190
uh... itself dot so the contract is it
doing things that the government used to

2289
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:09,909
do and that's not good

2290
01:55:09,909 --> 01:55:12,270
because when i was a case officer

2291
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:15,820
not only whether race that i would take
as a case officer of the contractor

2292
01:55:15,820 --> 01:55:19,389
would never take but there were also
some things i wouldn't do

2293
01:55:19,389 --> 01:55:21,719
that a contractor will do for money

2294
01:55:21,719 --> 01:55:25,880
uh... and a lot of our torture has been
handled by contractors

2295
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:30,689
uh... and i think we've lost
accountability of of our government

2296
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:36,189
and so i a personally plan to attend and
maybe even speak at the uh... second

2297
01:55:36,189 --> 01:55:39,189
annual meeting of these twenty seven
secessionists

2298
01:55:39,189 --> 01:55:42,670
movements takes place in october

2299
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:47,010
i'm not sure where but if you if you if
you look up kirkland sale

2300
01:55:47,010 --> 01:55:49,659
and secessionist you'll find the

2301
01:55:49,659 --> 01:55:52,219
marianne and insisted or whatever it's
called

2302
01:55:52,219 --> 01:55:55,560
and you'll you'll be able to find that i
would encourage all of you to show up

2303
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,130
there in october

2304
01:55:57,130 --> 01:55:59,679
and at the citizen summit in february

2305
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:01,939
on and it would be kind of fun

2306
01:56:01,939 --> 01:56:07,329
and i think coming back to your question
the bottom line is america's clueless

2307
01:56:07,329 --> 01:56:09,070
we need to do more

2308
01:56:09,070 --> 01:56:11,759
to put this information for example

2309
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,359
taking by cots

2310
01:56:13,359 --> 01:56:16,320
i would like to be able to identify anne

2311
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:23,320
good or service that is dependent on
prison labor and put it out of business

2312
01:56:27,270 --> 01:56:30,499
uh... yeah

2313
01:56:30,499 --> 01:56:33,719
okay stop

2314
01:56:33,719 --> 01:56:35,380

01:57:17,449 --> 01:57:21,150
i'm very proud of this book because it's
the first book did not have my name on

2330
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,349
the cover

2331
01:57:22,349 --> 01:57:25,690
hallmark toby was initially the junior
editor

2332
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:29,469
and he's a p_h_d_ student in uh... in
canada

2333
01:57:29,469 --> 01:57:33,469
and i realized after working with tom
aptly named george for and putting

2334
01:57:33,469 --> 01:57:35,549
together the first thirty pieces

2335
01:57:35,549 --> 01:57:38,619
i realized i should get out of the way
and i did and that was the beginning of

2336
01:57:38,619 --> 01:57:39,840
my new life

2337
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:43,619
on and now behind the scenes rather than
forward

2338
01:57:43,619 --> 01:57:45,869
and told me to his credit

2339
01:57:45,869 --> 01:57:49,599
now has a book that's better than
anything any of his professors of

2340
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:50,770
published

2341
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,440
and it's a seminal work

2342
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:57,020
you can get a free online the shortcut
for the free book which is a full p_d_ f

2343
01:57:57,020 --> 01:58:00,630
for the book that searchable in its
uh... individual documents for each

2344
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:05,829
chapter is ls s dot net forward slash
c_i_d_ for collective intelligence book

2345
01:58:05,829 --> 01:58:10,309
so i never try n sell this book without
telling you that it's free online

2346
01:58:10,310 --> 01:58:13,860
okay but it's a collectible it'll be a
pain in the ass for me to have to take

2347
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:16,179
the other four boxes back but that's
okay

2348
01:58:16,179 --> 01:58:17,670
all i can do that

2349
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:21,679
and everyone who buys the book gets one
of the golden campbell pence bomb the

2350
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:25,190
last two hundred and fifty i won't be
reproducing a okay we have another

2351
01:58:25,190 --> 01:58:27,579
question

2352
01:58:27,579 --> 01:58:28,869
yes ready

2353
01:58:28,869 --> 01:58:33,179
yes alright this was a follow up on
uh... depression wire in the streets and

2354
01:58:33,179 --> 01:58:34,909
you first off by saying

2355
01:58:34,909 --> 01:58:38,530
for clues how do we get the root out the
of

2356
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:39,690
everybody

2357
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:43,800
how to get through that there are some
people are saying is not that this isn't

2358
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:44,750
a problem

2359
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:51,639
it is a problem for thirty percent
approval rating for bush still

2360
01:58:51,639 --> 01:58:55,369
well let me repeat that comment take
away the broadcast license for the major

2361
01:58:55,369 --> 01:58:57,790
media corporations that certainly part

2362
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:59,900
all holden spectrum

2363
01:58:59,900 --> 01:59:05,690
is something we've got to have soon ups

2364
01:59:05,690 --> 01:59:08,289
okay the spectrum is certainly part of
it

2365
01:59:08,289 --> 01:59:09,280
although

2366
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:12,550
i'm actually going to end here this
forty second bit

2367
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:16,170
by saying that i have recently been
turned onto the possibilities of oregon

2368
01:59:16,170 --> 01:59:17,489
street theater

2369
01:59:17,489 --> 01:59:22,269
on and we can pick up on that bar when
we come back

2370
01:59:22,269 --> 01:59:23,870

2371
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:25,860
i actually don't have to go to the best

2372
01:59:25,860 --> 01:59:26,370
the

2373
01:59:26,370 --> 01:59:28,099

let's take a break and whoever comes
back i'll stay with his long as you want

2375
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:34,909
