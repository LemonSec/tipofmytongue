1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,060
he's been working on this stuff and it's
awesome his wife was like we had a few

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,469
minor technical problems

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,489
you so we're going to the second behind
I'm

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:21,490
Paula my mic okay so what my show and
tell Mom animus I produced an urban

5
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:28,359
milling weird things myself in with
others suffer couple years

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,920
on this supposition runs about 30
minutes or so so

7
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,450
of the whole questions will be plenty of
time for questions cuz I have questions

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,329
for you as well and I don't wanna miss
on them

9
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:42,329
and my interest in this got started back
in 1988

10
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,670
I was the ended idiocy and down a macro
that made those polish or bar codes that

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,670
you see on now

12
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,610
on oliver and political personal kids
and the idea behind this macro for

13
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,519
Microsoft Word I was that deals praise
on email get there faster

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,070
but no one like 50 box I was the poorest
for high school student and

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,219
so I'm wrote my own but some
instructions on how to do that so I had

16
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,220
to learn how to get specifications for
the post office and they won't do it

17
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,400
much for Business Insider make up
reasons and

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,900
this one social engineering along the
way it got a lot worse in college my

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,320
head even more time a huge research
libraries include things like the annals

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,460
of improbable research

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,740
Iran and the article on weird stuff they
were sending

22
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,240
and then of course I'll are wired for
time to send a contest that they run

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,970
every month in the editorial section

24
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,280
had the weirdest thing again the mail
gets a free t-shirt or something on them

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,659
now of you wonder why the post office
matters to them

26
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:36,640
I it's really important to our economy
because its its universal delivery

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,970
service is really cheap

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,479
oMG nobody here's my take something to
California for forty three some sex at

29
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,390
the post office

30
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,450
and a lot of banking a lot of business
medical supplies books large libraries

31
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,720
its I everybody is the postal system and
so it's it's really important to us

32
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,740
it's also need from a libertarian
standpoint because it's a fiscally

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,399
independent government organization

34
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,130
and there's not a lot of these out there
I it is a private corporation although

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,089
all the shares in

36
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,460
are owned by the fayed om no good

37
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,720
balanced is to paying for postal
delivery service said they completely

38
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,869
have to raise our money

39
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,390
and then I saw a few other agencies had
to do that too it's also

40
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,379
really useful for explaining hacking
techniques to do managers

41
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,190
because people have been really familiar
the postal system they know how we're

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,530
really know how to use it

43
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,180
and as long as you can't use it now
there are similar to

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,640
techniques we might use the computer
world but you don't have a computer

45
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,760
person a standard

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,970
so let's turn off by looking at

47
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,330
how letter get from point A to point B
and when you drop your

48
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,690
a lot of mail one first things that
happens the disoriented and cancelled

49
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,459
not stay in school and ultraviolet B
this is saddam not black-white

50
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,390
quote-unquote

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,140
yet so shorter wavelength higher energy
I'll bring allows the yet to be taken to

52
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,360
see which side to the envelope is the
address I'd

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,810
and also which direction determined on
nafta gonna play with this remember that

54
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,269
you he will burn your retinas against
sunburn I and it doesn't really he also

55
00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,470
wear eye protection

56
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,569
on you just like cheap two dollar safety
glasses from Home Depot leave a nice

57
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:04,709
outerwear blocks

58
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,459
pretty much all UV and now my sunglasses
do as well

59
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,060
so bizarre murders of so the first the
next thing that happens is they take a

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,280
picture for envelope

61
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,300
and this period orange bar code on the
back fence it's a fluorescent orange and

62
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,860
doesn't show up very well on projectors
but uses different space instead of that

63
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,220
hall in short order

64
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,620
incurred zeros and ones and the reason
to take a picture

65
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,629
at your envelope is that they can run
the address soon as the our system

66
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:32,870
and try to figure out what the whole
addresses including zip code and if they

67
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,049
can't figure it out like

68
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,390
if you have a doctor's handwriting the
this in the images to Singapore in the

69
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,950
half

70
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,980
your armies people working for on a
problem like 70 cents an hour

71
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,970
typing addresses now you're my
Wonderwall why we need the entire

72
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,010
address not much just as a kid

73
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,500
and the reason is they will take that
not apply forwarding so

74
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,530
ICN here in New York anti-male my friend
San Francisco a letter

75
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:58,720
but he's actually moved to Miami the
computer ago

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,989
we've affording order for this person
there's a reason the truck this to

77
00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:02,780
California

78
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,900
and then back again want to send it
straight to Miami say save a lot of

79
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,319
money

80
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,010
and that's part I'm even the postage
rates keep going up it's actually going

81
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,670
down we look at the inflation rate

82
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,540
sale a lot of these mom on nations and
and

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,410
additional efficiencies in the postal
stream axonal help it remain really

84
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,079
competitive

85
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,889
now after we figure out where it's
going. we apply carrier pre sorting

86
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:29,280
and the post office has this huge
database of all the addresses they

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,020
deliver to

88
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,030
and this is what they use to play the
next afforded to them to give

89
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,490
at the bar code they also add two more
did it's called the delivery point code

90
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,229
that's the actual stop number that the
mail truck makes is driving down the

91
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:41,800
street

92
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,710
so the computer system after efforts
plays at Barker dawn is the drought me

93
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,690
on sort mail

94
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,919
all the way down the point where the
mailman just opens the box grab the next

95
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
bundle in Sun City on

96
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,740
an doesn't have to be long and sorting

97
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:57,870
the does it for killing scene skin if
you look at it carefully

98
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,880
had broken up into different things are
different side to the street that's how

99
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,870
you get on an even number ranges

100
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,280
I this particular street with your
sample other the cul-de-sac but its

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,070
intersected by another street

102
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,849
such changes about halfway through the
intersection has that I think the

103
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,600
the mail truck it's a right hand can and
it's also interesting that

104
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,039
whoever's out 815 is at the end of the
cul-de-sac in

105
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,580
now he has his own zip plus 4 code

106
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,270
on 31 your I'm there's a lot about this
is like this particular post office

107
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,740
boxes

108
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,180
are but it gets interesting because you
can just ride zip plus 4

109
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,669
on an envelope and they will be
delivered

110
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:41,479
good no I suspect that in the future the
post office wall competently Brainiac

111
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,860
idea that they can just hand out numbers
that have nothing to do with the up

112
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,570
and that you register your ROM your
physical address that we move you don't

113
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,560
actually have to change your address my
magazine subscriptions in all your junk

114
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,100
mail

115
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,460
you tell the post office hey I'm number
52 8675 3 2009 and I things addresses

116
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,710
on if mister just so secure in every
business is unhelpful Security numbers

117
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:04,568
and yeah I don't be that idea

118
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,720
not yet even if you have multiple
numbers as well point the same person

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,430
bring this begs the question that won't
happen if I just put the zip code just

120
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,280
for the barking dog

121
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,949
envelope and mail it and the answers it
doesn't quite work that well

122
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,720
but almost on this is going to post
office box

123
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,120
and we sent several other pieces of mail
to the same post office box it had

124
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,580
various address in problems

125
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,699
and we got back at this exact same stamp
with the broken

126
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,110
EM broken are in the slightest much
offender and the

127
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,729
a dog stuck in the ED so we know that
this envelope meet

128
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,710
always the destination post office box
and I think what happened was that the

129
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,210
Act postal clerk is putting in the
cubicles

130
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,819
couldn't figure out which cubicle it
went in and say David the finger and

131
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,840
send it back

132
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,130
alright but these markets is this bar
codes are just the event by computer in

133
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,550
it doesn't think anything in it

134
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,690
answer first first opportunity to mess
up the system

135
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,479
so when I was in Baltimore you see the
post office %ah the yom

136
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,580
postmark in the top and we sent this
letter to atlanta

137
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,520
but we use the toilets were percent code
for high/low Hawaii

138
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,060
and with when we do these the always
under control and look at the same time

139
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,150
that's perfectly

140
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,520
address normally so we can judge how
much delay there is in the process

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,690
this and two weeks delivery time

142
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,969
and also my said they oppose market
again I finally figured out and and

143
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,860
blacked out the park adds that the
machine wouldn't keep sending it back to

144
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,229
whitey

145
00:07:28,229 --> 00:07:31,719
so this in addition to this the input
validation issue

146
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,960
arm because so many things rely on the
post office or use the post office is a

147
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,580
benchmark

148
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,758
this allows you to hack other things now
I P O my taxes like fun places in the

149
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,810
IRS agents the office I've never done
this

150
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,379
but since your tax payment must be
postmarked by April 15th

151
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:49,650
not necessarily received if somebody
sent their payment to

152
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,210
the thought of the office but they
coated it with mmm and no one is fishing

153
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:57,180
villages in alaska that only gets mail
once a month

154
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,319
your check just got flooded

155
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,060
so there's a lot of fans like that re
you can use the post office to do other

156
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,330
things

157
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,430
so we took the estranged dressing a
couple more steps for their limits

158
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,940
mother and leads to see

159
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,129
how good is this is the our system and
we've taken a number in this church sign

160
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,669
generator here and done a couple others

161
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:21,378
were we've used the picture and the
address was somewhere in the picture

162
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,229
and in every case these been delivered
we've never had one of these get lost

163
00:08:25,229 --> 00:08:29,120
I and on average we have less than one
day delay

164
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,700
between these in the control envelope so
we thought okay what

165
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,700
how good is the post office let's try
some captures

166
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:47,180
our new line of three other for these
arrived with no delay whatsoever

167
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,120
I'll the a1 the bottom right hand corner
which is a reading green camouflage

168
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,730
pattern

169
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,750
I it never arrived and in general we
don't get return addresses on

170
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,440
on our experiments because we want to
force them to put it through we don't

171
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,260
wanna given the

172
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,390
the option to just give the finger and
send it back and be lazy

173
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,660
are so the end of the dead letter office
and publish righted

174
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,269
I'll we've sent addresses that are ready
and we've sent addresses that are green

175
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:11,810
and those both live with no problems
whatsoever

176
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,019
but somehow mixing them up in the same
characters just confuses the heck out of

177
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:17,390
them

178
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,689
suppose not have been around for on a
twenty five years or so and they're

179
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,290
gonna get replaced with this new thing
called one code

180
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,029
now the post office commander think our
planet which is ace some the serial

181
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:27,480
number

182
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,769
an all salmon amassed me or us online
and Sears I'm sending out catalogs and

183
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:34,140
my office in catalyzing rhonda

184
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,300
Tom yet so I i get of junk mail spam and
junk mail company and I and I can

185
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,399
in addition to the down I securing
running information like the serial

186
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,430
number on the bottom

187
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,360
and every time I mail passes through
some sorting equipment the post office

188
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,630
Wilson is they don't say

189
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:51,810
says hey equipment over here saw this
Barker at this time

190
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,600
and so I can use that to judge how all
my meals propagating

191
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,320
now I can also use this the other
direction so you'll see this on a London

192
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,209
Fog visa and American Express statements
now where your stuff the mail back their

193
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:03,839
payment

194
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,490
house on those kids so now we can tell
that you drop your payment in the mail

195
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,600
and maybe think it's too late they want
to charge a late fee

196
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,640
or maybe the use it for cash flow
forecasting since they have a pretty

197
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
good idea where you pay your balance a
timer or just campaign the minimum if

198
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
you pay off completely

199
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,070
I also know if you wanna monkey around
with and you could send another envelope

200
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,079
but reuse the number that was assigned
to you

201
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,140
you can either do this but to slap you
know that another envelope we can make

202
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,730
your own one code you can mail a letter
to your mom your

203
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,019
you know yourself even and now the
computer go on as a payment from someone

204
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:41,800
so

205
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,870
okay so I'm not the only person who's
doing this and one a

206
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,450
worthy earlier works as follows the book
call the from when can I still have a

207
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,959
screw the post office

208
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,300
and what questions that comes up in this
is not some stuff

209
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,339
and this there's no way to get a legal
opinion from a post office on where you

210
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,570
can do something on

211
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:01,740
so you have to think of ways that you
can do these experiments that don't hurt

212
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,860
anything

213
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,519
on don't technically violate the law and
it's like you have the really neat idea

214
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:06,800
I

215
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,180
he says that he went out to utility
company and ask them for all the used

216
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,260
envelopes from payments they want to see
what other people were doing

217
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,490
I think you done for the ability case
one thing she discovered

218
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:20,850
what was that if you I kinda
arrangements Nelson cut them in half

219
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,870
that there's an app for that ultraviolet
to get there the post office says

220
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,100
although this is going to be a fun yes
once and I'm on

221
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,130
and so we wandered from were also that
work

222
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,430
mister wizard tells us on that the Tom
the glue in the stamp is actually

223
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,709
contains the tag and

224
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,870
so if you have a sheet a cedar Pino
stamps

225
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,899
will add stuff also close so you know
where this is going

226
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,060
we could have answered on the envelope
answer another post marketing class a

227
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,240
troop

228
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,050
now it would really suck to be stuck in
federal prison for stealing forty-three

229
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,980
census stamps

230
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,360
I'm pretty sure that would make the
everybody's bitch arm so what do the

231
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,779
little things we discovered was that

232
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:04,200
two-cent stamps don't blow so we cover
the back a 2-cent stamps and thoughts

233
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,100
that we pay the postage on this envelope

234
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,339
million other stuff too close to arm any
the I'll

235
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,110
a meter marks glow in those going to UVA
as you can see that under blacklight

236
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,029
are you can also get his prepaid
envelopes for the post office they had

237
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:22,680
like an extra three or four cents to
cover the

238
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,389
cost the paper and it just has a tiny
little strap is like maybe the size of

239
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:27,950
my thumb nail that blows

240
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,339
so it doesn't take very much at all that
the trip cancellation equipment thinking

241
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,980
that's an actual envelope but his wish
we could have some other issues too

242
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,320
as it uses the the stamp to orient the
envelope like him

243
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,519
what would happen if we pull in
different places and I'll

244
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,260
the couple meet once the upper right
when you can see the bar code is on the

245
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,010
top

246
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:51,779
I was actually process the envelope
upside down I them arrive with that 2x

247
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:55,189
them arrived I think a day later the one
right below it the same problem

248
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,440
it arrived three days later on the other
2i think actually rival control time

249
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,139
but interesting that the several
positions you can put it where it can

250
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:05,130
reaching can cancel

251
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,220
so you can kinda messed machine type nom
it is illegal to use the state even if

252
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,000
it's not canceled so we have these in
the safe and we can demonstrate the

253
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,310
memory is them

254
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,980
so those little things you can do with
envelopes the packages are fun tale

255
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,410
so it's in a variety of fun packages

256
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:24,180
beyond the happy face there's probably
the most fun is a 12 inch ball I think

257
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,910
it's a a Walmart promotion

258
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,519
and now so we we rode on the back as an
apparent actually

259
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,139
and I put stamps on it rather address
and taken to the counter to I wasn't

260
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,829
served like what surcharges would simple
word on apply

261
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,550
I think it'll scale a transfer and his
computer typing is that cared and walls

262
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,529
of the scale

263
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,910
and goes well and hits the floor

264
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,579
say picks it up and you have this is a
postal clerk they put on scaly and turns

265
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:51,750
running into walls lop

266
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:55,100
so finally be like put some pants on the
scale makes a love triangle and zeros

267
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,769
that in ways and we get stamps to
foreign

268
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,930
now is getting he was heading south
mission was to do it is somewhat taken

269
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,110
aback

270
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,010
as he takes in the back reports on table
and it comes out here why are my

271
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:12,139
hope got my pick up my parents just fine
Texas I'll stick

272
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:15,560
five days I think to make it to you live
from Leonard Washington DC and just

273
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,490
covered with dense

274
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,649
Albert a question to the and are now

275
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,019
able to: nothing like a dance com the
your pennies were kinda fun my car

276
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:27,779
tonight people were got messed up

277
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:32,130
and he just never talk to people the car
tag office and now so I some how does

278
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:34,939
get much money and status and MSN and
pennies

279
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,570
on but we didn't want the Flat Rate
Priority Mail Boxes

280
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:44,970
and some people often ask it will pull
people think about your products and

281
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:45,709
white wall

282
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,220
you when you walk into the 70-pound
flattery prior to the All Blacks

283
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,570
eye-catching a yearly thing against the
system here when the ass getting it on

284
00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:00,570
its pennies the tag office day love you

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,269
for trial some even now playing around
with Parcells recently and one

286
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,660
experience we tried was

287
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:09,589
what happens if you take the up a
delivery confirmation sticker and reuse

288
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:10,310
it

289
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,389
now to start with I think delivery
confirmation is really stupid

290
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:17,800
I mean why should I have to pay a
service fee to find out whether or not

291
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,100
I got what I paid for it's like it would
you feel if they said

292
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,720
would you like oil teens confirmation to
me

293
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,709
so the whole thing's a racket but basic
question if I reuse label

294
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:32,100
what's going to happen cell work

295
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,259
some thoughts were that may be the first
package but a sharply tracking online

296
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,949
and maybe to track it online only the
second package which show up

297
00:15:39,949 --> 00:15:43,910
and maybe if they were really smart both
packages that show up

298
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,040
but this is the post office were talking
about your package is obliterated it's

299
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,170
gone

300
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,449
now this is really dangerous because
this leads the way into on hacking

301
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:53,100
pretty much

302
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,240
any e-commerce store that uses the post
office

303
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,490
arm a scammer can order something for
eBay and receive the package

304
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,250
then we could be mailed package
basically to anyone could be a milligram

305
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,529
self recycle center is mom whatever

306
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,689
our way for the package did not show up
on the Post Office website anymore and

307
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,459
then complain that he never received it

308
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:14,720
and soul doesn't have a lottery force
now it doesn't happen every time so if

309
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,500
you are so you're not deemed

310
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,019
arm we found it happen about 75 percent
of the time and we're not quite sure

311
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:24,660
why it's why it's not exactly the same
all the time

312
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,699
i it seems to happen mostly with your
print barcodes like from Stan Stockholm

313
00:16:27,699 --> 00:16:29,560
software or keeping of

314
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,790
you bassist amor pay pal system a Post
Office website

315
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,040
on and we've never been able to get this
to work with the green stickers

316
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,079
up in any case track your stuff early
often and and say the personal

317
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,660
so it's in some other interesting
parcels are just trying to test the

318
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,219
limits

319
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,570
love what the postal system fails om the
small things successfully sent a package

320
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,459
playing cards the lightest thing they
were sent to your container

321
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,730
I'll circles and spheres make it very
well I was an honorable bouncy balls and

322
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:59,399
not yours like 90 on someone's in the
indicated

323
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,690
Walmart on the be serious or earlier

324
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,120
on other phone line is we've written an
address on a sticky note and a stuck the

325
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,589
sticky note to letters and by and boxes
both

326
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,589
in-state stock on the post office is a
as actually trying to make it into

327
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,928
commercial service of some sort because
they think marketers will pay money for

328
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,069
it

329
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:21,369
another fun one is unprotected CDs we
have about 75 percent

330
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:24,949
success rate setting a CD totally
unprotected Michael put the address on

331
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,350
the label itself and and stick a stamp
third

332
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,370
on and then when it was evil post am
also that it

333
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,840
it doesn't vibrate in the driver may
call in ways and identify check some

334
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,120
and 75 result I'm the day let me read
perfectly with no envelope unusual case

335
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,140
no nothing

336
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,750
one my favorite is we don't simply
honesty testing we're taking

337
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,539
mom really thin and blitzer glassine
I'll stamp collectors getting fighting

338
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:48,700
them from the post office

339
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,350
and we put money in them so you can
clearly see that there's money in this

340
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,439
envelope

341
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,090
and with mail that and up it's never
been lost

342
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,570
it's never been stolen but sometimes we
get a white opaque

343
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:04,039
USPS envelope somebody's me an address
to that our city and and they put in

344
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,940
money inside that and sealed it

345
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,960
so what this tells me is most postal
employees are pretty honest

346
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,190
but they think their coworkers on yep

347
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,900
are we try to the two hundred dollars

348
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,549
say arm can pretty daring and sell what
we've been playing with that with

349
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:25,830
various packages we saw a lot of small
stuff

350
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,449
armed the post office that's bus was not
small size limits and now length and

351
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,160
girth to basically take all six
dimensions

352
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,669
package and together it's got to be.
less than a hundred and thirty inches

353
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,330
and we try to design the weirdest thing
we could sound and so far the best we've

354
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,909
come up with a pool noodle

355
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:48,910
South was fun good

356
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,010
somehow traditional tests in progress
were playing around somewhere with color

357
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,980
blindness tells

358
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,299
are trying to see how picks up different
colors in different colors a paper

359
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,660
I we're trying to find out specific
really bright orange the use the bar

360
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,380
codes in the back and try to make and
what about that

361
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,270
arm we're playing a strange centers a
gravity like you know they can achieve a

362
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,480
tp2 box

363
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,840
and I put a block a tungsten in one
corner and then to stay on the rest in

364
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,100
are we've been playing around trying to
send some packages like the dry ice that

365
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,830
get lighter is a go through the vessels
wimp

366
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,049
said I get a refund on delivery up

367
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,720
are also playing around love alone or
Garmin recycled envelopes

368
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,780
most recent one we've done is this
aluminum foil and loads which actually

369
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,879
make their way to the post is very very
well

370
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,309
armed sunnyside out was just as well as
long as I can

371
00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:42,428
so if he's a young I what about the

372
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:46,580
are getting your own cancellation
pronounce and there's a a couple types

373
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,620
you could do

374
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,460
I it's really archaic there's like some
old stamp collector law that allows you

375
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,460
to apply for permit to cancel your mail

376
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,690
and have you are healthy and that has
like all the stuff you need to go pick

377
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:57,780
up and get it

378
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,899
on but it would be instantly know that
your post office is a weirdo too great

379
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,940
for to do

380
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,780
are and there's also a couple separate
system call pictorial postmarks the view

381
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,970
public hearing from the holidays work
usually advertisers will get to their

382
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,210
own postmarked upon

383
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,120
outgoing mail and now you can get these
are the mostly for special occasions and

384
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,750
festivals and stuff like that and
there's

385
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,190
an amoeba 120 or so any given time
around the world

386
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,110
I didn't find out about hope in time to
get II hope cancellation for the secured

387
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,010
but if we do another one are you gonna
have work on your area it's a really

388
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,530
hack

389
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,360
so I got a couple challenges for all the
other things I can't quite figure out

390
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,120
your hand

391
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,220
aren't one of them I'm looking for help
decoding electronic and Asia on my East

392
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:37,780
champs

393
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,330
and Dom now different imprint from
posted services

394
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:44,730
we decode number them at the accuse
number stream it looks like this

395
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,980
bled even on sequentially printed arm

396
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,250
stamps like the into the same that kid
from the same meter for the same amount

397
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,590
the same date

398
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,850
even the number groupings change around
and it seems like there's some things

399
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,090
that match up

400
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:00,789
each time like maybe's you like ninety
percent meter numbers are in there

401
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:02,100
somewhere in this one

402
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,820
on the printer next one to different
places and it doesn't appear there

403
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,020
& Suites we haven't been able to find
out anything on something but he

404
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,510
works for a company that makes these I'd
be really interested in specifications

405
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:13,950
cuz

406
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,970
right now the post office is just not
given to me

407
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,159
another stricken fun to do is a GPS
tracking and I understand there some

408
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,690
some cheap but one of cell phones that
you can get that sent a signal backs the

409
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,840
same weather out

410
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,918
and I've I dug around all that my just
gonna be able find any sales people who

411
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:31,380
can

412
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:34,440
likes only something worse directly so
if you've experimented with the

413
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,059
GPS cell phone talking abundant like
what the Bible service to get

414
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:42,289
and stuff third answer to buying yarn
delivery confirmation we can actually

415
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:46,419
tracker packages and see where the heck
they are

416
00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,690
and I'm also trying to send a package in
get stuck in the postal system for

417
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,419
entire year

418
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,820
and the best idea I've come up with so
far as to cut a hole in the box and put

419
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,450
like an LCD display in their

420
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:03,450
and every night at midnight change the
address

421
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,870
anyway I just I just don't know enough
yet about the electrons on how to do

422
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,159
this

423
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,200
I know it's really simple and there's no
makes got the different controllers to

424
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,640
cart

425
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,700
on but I'd I just haven't had time to
learn how to do it yet

426
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,850
the best simple idea from up with this
again the book reader and later 360

427
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,480
3/3 65 page PDF for the different
address on Danny's page

428
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,799
and just use a timer to advance the page
every day but yeah

429
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,900
anybody would like to help out with this
we we have some ideas on how to power a

430
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,020
tea and some ideas on on how to make a
package strong enough to withstand that

431
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,360
kind of abuse

432
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,549
so there's a couple for ethical
considerations i mentioned already don't

433
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:45,870
steal from post office

434
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,299
on it really would suck at the
government spending a hundred thousand

435
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,309
dollars a year to keep incarcerated for
stealing 43 cents

436
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:54,850
I this is done doesn't make any sense
are please don't do anything to harm to

437
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,760
the people's mail

438
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,929
and we've had a really careful with this
like we had a group a magician's we're

439
00:22:58,929 --> 00:22:59,830
working with

440
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,570
that Tom we bleed all the box that is
too big to fit down the slot in the

441
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,289
mailbox

442
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,600
and it's like had elastic bands
definitely would reassemble itself when

443
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,900
you like I love it

444
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,360
Tom the only does that the song on a
used one we discovered that it could

445
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,230
clog up with that would fill up a huge
amount of space and the people who bring

446
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,000
a male and female staff in

447
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,950
so we just decided to lay off that idea

mixed not so difficult to convey a
covered okay that's better

486
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,130
Ron you said a lot of stuff to the same
location with the people

487
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,740
at the post office box called their
views but getting all these meetings

488
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,929
coming to that one box

489
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:39,909
yes are we have several but we have
several participants on summer because

490
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:41,210
Evans don't like the

491
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,409
didn't have the address is on a big
screen and I didn't wanna like have 'em

492
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,909
presentation folders blacked out stuff
and make you look at the CIA or

493
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:48,840
something

494
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,809
are but yeah we have our about 15 people
nationwide the sense that is so we know

495
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:56,010
if we're getting consistent results from
one post office box the next

496
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,429
are don't you think about sorry two
things arm

497
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,429
the phone you want to look at is the
tracfone there's one model that's like

498
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,279
20 bucks or something P paid and it has
a GPS and you can send the GPS

499
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:07,010
coordinates

500
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:12,760
over SMS visit no I continuously sound
at work you can program it to do

501
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,929
whatever kind of sending you and the
service with iPhone owners alike and how

502
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:18,580
long after his early 30 results into the
fountain

503
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,330
so you have to load whatever the
previous offers on the phone find out on

504
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,158
you all the details

505
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:26,850
it's a tracfone specifically on the
other 1i wanna just his have you tried

506
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:29,110
much sending make internationally

507
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,010
I don't know haven't most likely don't I
don't know anybody internationally to

508
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,490
send stuff to me or for me a sense after
them

509
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,110
yeah I'd be interested in SMEs if I can
accurately I don't space in Toronto so

510
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,390
if you wanna send the stuff we don't
have been sent to email my address is on

511
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,440
the I'd love to get some international
stuff

512
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,620
so your turn okay is it not something
I'd recommend people do because it goes

513
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,020
against you are saying about keep about
a VoIP for Eid

514
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,110
but yes is that this is a comment the
old the

515
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,820
the ancient recovered for flipping the
addresses

516
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,000
has worked in the past and probably does
that doesn't mean

517
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,659
it you should be doing it but it merely
yet the radically a good first thing as

518
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,900
a theory exercise it does work

519
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,169
yes it does work on we know people who
have tried it I haven't tried it myself

520
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:15,100
but people send me stuff that way it was
unsolicited

521
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,880
I I don't recommend it because really
obviously can't and won't if the

522
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,570
postmark

523
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,850
a city doesn't match the return address
city that you have a really hard time

524
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,149
explaining that courtside

525
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:26,260
wouldn't ride I did you see the

526
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,700
the TSA back and talk or are you a yes
they did

527
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,360
our considered that approach may be
published with the GPS logging

528
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,240
arm yes I that section of the questions
on it out thank you for bringing it up

529
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,500
I would love to deal with I think the
cell phone and also be able to put

530
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,600
unlike in a way sensor something on Sat
tons of fun from the airplane

531
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,210
that we may like it has lost I can tell
what city it's an analyst stan around

532
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,059
the airport waiting for it

533
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:53,080
arm there's also a group of people have
sent cameras to the post office

534
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,100
and I deposit don't have a link but Dom

535
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:59,840
a Google probably knows and that was
that was kinda interesting I wasn't even

536
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,520
put a camera on the side of the box a
big sign a box asking postal employees

537
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,899
to please take pictures

538
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:07,950
and when they got the entire camera
inside his like this post employees in

539
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:10,210
different places taking pictures around
the place

540
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,529
sell that the defense sense humor your
point

541
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,200
yeah i i thank you for talking and you
ate keep I've been doing I've been

542
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,299
trying to fight the

543
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,510
the junk mail influx it's very bad luck
been waging lately

544
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:26,090
on things I do a lot of people do with
the get the postage page

545
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:30,450
postage-paid envelope from from
unsolicited send their business reply

546
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:30,980
mail

547
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,140
people your with people you know they'll
take me just send the

548
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,429
drawn back in the mail from and I've
taken all rubber mat trying to

549
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:42,260
I get the mails from these these things
where they send you a huge

550
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,220
what of coupons Nadal won so I've been
set wrong was I have been taken those in

551
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,000
jamming them

552
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,710
into the put the postage-paid yasser
turned thanks

553
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,740
trying to figure how to increase the
weight move the post okay

554
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,929
is dis couple things without I actually
know somebody who got rid of an entire

555
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:00,029
power to an extra breaks

556
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:04,690
I and the the bases by any a couple
things to consider

557
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,980
the first in addition to the postage
I'll the down

558
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,529
the company that owns the does reply no
permit also have to pay a surcharge I

559
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:15,559
think it's like 49 cents an envelope so
it's almost the book right now

560
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:19,649
just isn't it back empty on you can add
additional way too and i think is a

561
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:20,330
weight limit

562
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,320
oMG the post office is also not required
to charge them all they are required to

563
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,370
deliver it

564
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,559
also I'm not sure how much economic
damage you can have up another thing

565
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,639
I've heard is that dollar credit card
companies that receive a lot of those

566
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,159
are they open all automated equipment in
order to process it and gave notice

567
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,360
looks like bar codes and stuff

568
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,710
identify your applications that ought to
be typewritten all I can think

569
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:44,669
on glue the invalid completely shocked
the public jam on this machine some

570
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:48,340
go for it have you ever tried sending
magnets through the post-sale

571
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,640
magnets yes weaves we start you can some
magnets

572
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,279
if they're above a certain power rating
they have to be labeled as the

573
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,909
or deregulated materials domestic calm
but yes you can as long as it's packaged

574
00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:02,500
properly

575
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,309
so you don't like has a to stick to a
machine as far as you know

576
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:10,600
arm if the Packers properly it's a non
stick to machine on that this also gets

577
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,750
into it and we've we've sent some like
now

578
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,260
like baseball size nearly magnets and
like you if you pick the southern moved

579
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,879
across the room you need to think before
you walk

580
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,020
%ah because all the things like playing
a hand in a file cabinet break the

581
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,950
bounce and add

582
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,250
I and we have some discussed after the
male body yeah I

583
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,580
properly packaged it is safe to do oMG
but yet the

584
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,110
be careful about the SAT the point you
mentioned mailing out

585
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,000
phone with GPS yes principally gonna is
there i mean you could probably in

586
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,250
trouble for that if it's on

587
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:42,460
you also mentioned having none of us on
the phone so if you mail the phone that

588
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,659
was on my airmail

589
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,730
are I don't know I don't know any rules
against and if it goes

590
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,750
airmail it's a good question I mean
style you start to have

591
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,860
radio transmitter and what happened with
the FAA regulations as a passenger from

592
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,340
allowed to

593
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:59,370
on Argo so I don't know I don't know how
cargo would actually

594
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:02,610
that would actually work with that was a
big ass up at camp thing to bring arrest

595
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,039
me I

596
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,000
you know it's a question I'm just does
all kinds and I can get into the whole

597
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,950
nother supper talk about the cell phones
in airplanes I am a pilot and I'm

598
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,820
the second talk a lot about I'll with
the hazards on hazards on so much that

599
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,990
one so fun to mess things up as we have
a hundred and fifty of them

600
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,200
on actually the the pilot can hear that
Dad GPS Chaturthi in your computer

601
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,149
speakers

602
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,620
and we have a lot on it %ah that's
probably the most the interference that

603
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,809
we would die receive

604
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:30,750
but now pilots right on the front to
colin White the I'm approach will be

605
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,740
home in time for dinner or whatever

606
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,399
and you hear on the ATC frequencies
all-time cell it's not gonna call to a

607
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,260
plane to crash

608
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:40,809
yeah i i would like to find some way to
they were able to detect some you might

609
00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:41,779
really in trouble

610
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,970
aren't we I don't really I don't know on
the fun things we have to check out

611
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,649
before we

612
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:49,340
down for good now thanks for coming on
his No

613
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,549
I've heard that was more due to keeping
people's attention

614
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:56,019
during the takeoff and landing
procedures the thumb the case you should

615
00:31:56,019 --> 00:31:57,850
be all that talk to russell flight

616
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:01,260
on cell phone carriers also don't like
the fact you're six mile high antenna

617
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,649
and start connecting multiple powers
that's why they haven't really for have

618
00:32:04,649 --> 00:32:05,880
a hissy fit on

619
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,110
much a point in the truck from maybe
more cost-effective

620
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,409
but have you thought about sending photo
loggers Matt for

621
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:16,880
photographers use to track the pictures
and basically keep the timestamp

622
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,720
and the current location it doesn't tell
me where my packages what's lost enough

623
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,450
stuff that what we're looking deal

624
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,049
om I have several customers use any part
in this is actually for work I have

625
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,090
customers is handled through the mail

626
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:31,059
I like you don't know the Hope Diamond
is actually sent registered mail to this

627
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,549
analysis on in post office very proud
that

628
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,779
I N E the registered mail service
actually have a lower loss rate than any

629
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,230
other courier service in the nation

630
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:41,769
so if you're if you get in commercial
insurance is actually cheaper on but ya

631
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:42,200
there

632
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,710
there website only updates like once
every 48 hours or something like that

633
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,200
and we would like more real time
tracking them down

634
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,570
so that's kinda Laurentian but down yeah
thanks

635
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,658

inside the envelope for also with
respect the question

639
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,330
love whether s stress might be imposed
on the

640
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,710
a glued seem depending on what you you
put inside

641

rebar of

643
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:25,299
and the rules are as long as stadia stay

papon although most the time the let

648
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,240
that fly

649
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,149
ask me of the hot glue on actually the

651
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,269
stripped there yes just Iron Girl

652
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:52,830
arm that idea for short distances that
works for longer distances the the

653
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,620
chipboard it's made out of can really
handle that much weight

654
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,090
om we've put balloons in them and those
go pretty good

655
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,679
and %uh Kozma structural damage and
we've also put are rare earth materials

656
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:05,850
like dog stand on the don't perform a
lot but take it up to the

73 pound maximum weight limit for om for
the Postal Union

mom annie has a concussion are no

659
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,290
but you those experiments you did also
with the

660
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,349
not not just stuff flat rate parcels but
flatly

661
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:24,480
emblems yes the other the cardboard flat
rate envelope yes

662
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,589
yes yes it definitely is for the the
rebar not that the plastic cannot charge

663
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,770
recycle once

664
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,239
it was in you you're talking about
having an update

665
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,730
and address continually update like
daily a huge issues like a piece of like

666
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,060
adding machine

667
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,320
role or like Tom your receipt printer
paper

668
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,389
in had something in there that would
like wind it every

669
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,320
okay so you'd like com shannon is have a
clear window in which as you know the

670
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,919
address

671
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,520
II don't I don't know a lot about like
building stuff mom from

672
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,530
by scrapping likewise we thought about
doing that would like %uh Mindstorms

673
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,740
that'd be pretty simple to tell it now
turn ons that someone step forward

674
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,150
cell that's good idea

675
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,740
I something I've just learned recently
if you live in a small town is big city

676
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,550
near your

677
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,310
local man I'll say your mailing
something yourself get routed to the big

678
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,940
city then sent back to you

679
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,820
the actually say to the person at the
counter keep in office

680
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:22,480
they will not send it out to the main I
guess they where they're out the mail

681
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,750
yes in their local seeker dare to offer
delivery

682
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,690
yesterday you can there's some there's a
lot of love request like that you can

683
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,170
make

684
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,089
on for example stamp collectors like
their like their male to be stamped a

685
00:35:34,089 --> 00:35:36,180
specific way and it's part of my the

686
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:39,490
apply yourself cancellations Tom is
interesting

687
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,359
and a lot of just now wanted to be near
just that the minimum amount possible on

688
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,230
you can do that also be happening
fragile you can ask my hand can slide

689
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,230
and here's another problem

690
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,270
less thing I was in office early just
like two people working there and I

691
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,650
asked him about this is that will get
the postmaster for you

692
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:57,349
and now to the back room came a little
guy in for the local post office he was

693
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,960
called

694
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,290
postmaster yes on some post offices also
have a separate mail drop for in town

695
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:02,720
male

696
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,160
yessir on which the at the same thing
since gas is your time

697
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,390
before I'd like to thank you for your
for your talking is very interesting

698
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:14,150
I was wondering if anybody through
perhaps the use of helium has tried

699
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,440
sending something it's later than

700
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,640
air yes we look into that and the yeah

701
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,950
that the problem is there's nothing that
die we found that

702
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,020
is saddam light enough to contain the
helium

703
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:30,009
the everything is just too fragile
already exceeds the the relatively small

704
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,050
sizes

705
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,579
on it was like a mile are bland or
something like that

706
00:36:34,579 --> 00:36:38,369
on and it one thing to keep in mind if
you know sometimes you get some static

707
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:40,859
when you take stuff at the counter in
the IRS area today

708
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:43,950
%eh male dancer I don't have to for that
the boxer

709
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:48,619
if it's under 13 ounces you can just
drop it off and not talk to anybody

710
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:51,750
SL are yeah it might be possible with

711
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,410
what are some sort of farm not
strengthened tough long-term I'll art

712
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,440
don't have learned that yeah I just I
haven't found anything that's really

713
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,599
accessible to me I'm

714
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,390
sale thank you to come up with some
ideas on how they are not going out with

715
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,868
me think it's in a negative way

716
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:08,460
kid covering

717
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,710
I I didn't see it on your list to view
or else but you may

718
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:15,910
you may know it's a a browser for ZIP
Codes summer for Corp

719
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,629
dot com yes um its it see it seemingly
unique because

720
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,880
you can you can put in address and see
not only

721
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,240
you get the the bar code in the the full
zip plus 4 plus

722
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,310
place to mother will also let you browse
the neighborhood see

723
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,799
other addresses and what the valid
addresses are

724
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,760
for like several like all up and down
the block all yes the street you can do

725
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,560
that Post Office website to just buy
acomplia street address and not die

726
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,980
not specify address and that's how I got
the rain let you that such a screen

727
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,290
capture

728
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,130
yet so it's it's interesting semaphore
Corp that Carmen yes

729
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,130
I guess they're in the business is
selling data but there's also mon-fri

730
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:53,910
lookup

731
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:57,368
yes just its interesting yes it's me
reference thanks for mentioning

732
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:00,910
22 two quick questions are how much
would you say you invest in postage in

733
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,910
the air

734
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,460
on in the year maybe two hundred fifty
dollars

735
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,510
on Mill most that's because we're
sending multiple copies of the same

736
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:09,390
staff to

737
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:12,609
to other people so we get a larger
sample space

738
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:16,609
it is by no means statistically
significant sample space but dance

739
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:20,828
greater than one and then have you
tested like the structural intensity

740
00:38:20,829 --> 00:38:24,380
for like how much a packages jostled
like a vase

741
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,690
thin strip love Legos and seen if they
break up into all pieces on Wii console

742
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,950
number in a package

743
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:33,040
on that were down that would measure
that

744
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,300
are who else can we do there is not one
person who made

745
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,609
a ball ink pens pointed out and now

746
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,470
a is an art project to see how much to
get scrambled up inside the box

747
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:46,670
and I was kinda interesting on

748
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,190
we haven't done much else without
although we have been doing some

749
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:50,670
experimentation in now

750
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:54,550
materials packaging now we're currently
sending and cook eggs the mail

751
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:59,079
up week we we drill small burn holes and
now one hand and then a

752
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,329
punch the other hand I'm use compressed
air to blow the actual extent down so

753
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:04,820
it's not a spoiler turn rancid or
anything like that

754
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:07,990
I also makes the egg just the shell so
it's now weaker because there's no

755
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,300
internal structure

756
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,470
job doesn't he found his two I use a
milk crate as an excess skeleton our box

757
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,089
and we we've thrown off a parking tax we
drop kick Tom

758
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:20,140
I we haven't thrown one of an airplane
yet because coming

759
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,299
I but the others you can get public
package you can

760
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,640
the G forces in the mail are negligible
thanks so

761
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,660
oh I want to follow that are you can
send certain types of live animals for

762
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,690
the mail

763
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,990
sowed

764
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,230
so I heard a rumor a while back that

765
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:41,390
at MIT's Draper labs when they were
developing missile guidance systems they

766
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,069
in fact

767
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,710
try mailing gyroscopes themselves to see
if the dead reckoning state accurate

768
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,869
and course being gyroscopes they would
process so the postman would have a

769
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:53,980
sorta balancing this man and when I got
onto the mail handling equipment might

770
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,190
sometimes put itself on a ramp

771
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,140
i think is that because one with the
sound of that service there's a gravity

772
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,359
idea should money more about that but we
have a power to

773
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,690
that because I was gonna suck a lot of
power yeah I mean less so if you've got

774
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,460
social vacuum pack them in a course they
had military equipment but I've always

775
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,230
been dubious as to whether this was true
service or wonder if you've ever heard

776
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:13,950
about it

777
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:18,700
arm I think I know where I can get
somewhat when I am pilots I can get

778
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,200
%ah mcintyre is no problem by thinking
is something I can borrow a set of

779
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,270
political violence from to try that with

780
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,950
so I have to give it a shot so absence
right the RSS feed me you'll see a

781
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,050
passing

782
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:33,650
I'm really quick question is was no do
it happens all those

783
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,810
sends letters people Sam lead to the
gonna trash to get return known he the

784
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,430
down it said a charity thing that postal
employees the other good as the hard

785
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,450
on their routed to whatever city the

786
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:48,829
the child Assam is that and there's

787
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,849
volunteer groups that try to answer as
many as possible

788
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:54,540
a lot I'm just now get a written
response back to its conflict for

789
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,069
officers to purge Miller best wishes bed

790
00:40:57,069 --> 00:41:00,730
I yeah for like am poor kids and stuff
they they try to fill wishes

791
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,930
and nice postal employees to do that
data off the clock

792
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:07,240
for free sale yeah they they get handled

793
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,790
sound good question yeah he said that

794
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:14,220
one time someone you mail the camera
through the mail yes I think I ever

795
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,390
thought my phone

796
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:18,170
and seeing if you have a conversation
with someone was processing the mail

797
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,550
yeah other than I think yeah

798
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,869
arm that everyone has an issue and talk
time is an issue except that down you

799
00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:25,750
can get the

800
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,930
places T Mobile has the ally free
unlimited calls to five people

801
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,220
so you could just feel like the job are
you now have a date having

802
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,390
yeah that's a neat idea what look you
doing i'd

803
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:41,069
are along the lines of shipping phones
if you're worried about causing

804
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:41,869
interference

805
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,060
on a plane you could possibly use an
accelerometer and

806
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,069
a just a very light power drive circuit

807
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:51,829
that could turn off everything else if
the speed ever cross the threshold

808
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:55,329
so soon as you're on the tarmac in
coming up to speed you can turn off for

809
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,619
all the other circuitry

810
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,780
and waits to you see the deceleration
and turn our back on

811
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,970
right I'm that's a very good idea thank
you

812
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,710
sir well remembered as me missus
expensive night I have access to surplus

813
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:07,460
than

814
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:11,280
yeah I have accessible citizen parts I
good

815
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,170
this is so much for still hacking this
more as an interest in you want to go

816
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,329
home with the mail

817
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:18,630
um there's a certain company that sells
a and farms

818
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,000
hunt but when you buy the farm you don't
buy actual and seek an accord

819
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,760
yes Israeli actress in yes amphibians
and these are gonna live animals in

820
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,440
something else

821
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,780
rate so you to call you similar anywhere
but they don't check to see who sent it

822
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,890
to fit

823
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,339
anywhere you want you

824
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:39,950
I

825
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,270
you well

826
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:51,270
ok thank you very much you up

827
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:55,000
okay on that women suck on it was if you
wanna play a prank on somebody down so

828
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,510
the post office on get one though some

829
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,569
to the ant farm cats inside is a
postcard that you write off to the

830
00:43:00,569 --> 00:43:02,369
company and I'll mail you the chance

831
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:05,859
but they don't necessarily know the the
you're the one who bought it so you can

832
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:07,990
have them send a chance to whoever you
want

833
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:12,730
your

834
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,980
to Fort sir on the no dove from averting
a package in the post office for a year

835
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,140
if you've seen back to the future yes my
health

836
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,270
your I'm getting at Cannes way do
something like that I'll

837
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,329
Wow the post office is not only the
business holding males

838
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:31,250
on I'm not sure how we would how would
something that far

839
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,730
i mean that was done with Western Union
on which the product or service

840
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:38,950
the closest thing we've done without is
signed as they were evacuating New

841
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,089
Orleans for Katrina

842
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:44,029
I sense some people letters Annex I want
to see what kinda crazy

843
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,680
I returned every time steve harrigan on
it or how long it delayed

844
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,328
and out what happened was that everybody
go back to their homes and it said

845
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:55,280
I have no power my sewer is backed up I
got 6 inches of water in my house and

846
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,349
there's no gas

847
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:01,490
but I have letter from you yeah

848
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,050
group so that they really work hard

849
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:08,079
now Tom he's a question

850
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,589
I in terms have showing the phone off

851
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:16,319
when you doing airmail you could you
know as the city have axed

852
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,339
airplane parts can maybe try doing some
serving altimeter

853
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:23,190
thing now know how that would work is
the ultimate in her hotel room after a

854
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:24,040
case of

855
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:28,119
on because you're already at ground
level com we look at BB like the

856
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:29,460
intensity of noise cats

857
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,619
its net very noisy on there but you're
not number wouldn't work

858
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:37,510
on specially considered like results to
my airplane is the field altitude Denver

859
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,210
and now and then if you could while
another way to do it is if

860
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:45,920
you could get GPS will if GPS would be
working in the plane

861
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,349
GPS will give you a rough altitude
reading

862
00:44:50,349 --> 00:44:55,930
I'll yeah it was nice to be back out the
TL you not knowing how 18 Calderon

863
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,450
del yeah you can admire yeah are you

864
00:44:59,450 --> 00:45:03,450
your national/international wouldn't
work on however it might that we use GPS

865
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,900
to censor speed

866
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,339
and if we actually do things and set
aside I would make more sense

867
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,640
airports are who had fun for me to think
that just

868
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,020
for energy just looking at once Sao here

869
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,390
listed

870
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,460
yeah baby more like 20 miles near the
purse pattern but yeah

871
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:25,250
a GPS might work with something Fontana
sound you thanks

872
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:30,569
as wasn't um I think I I saw it quite a
while ago with a.m.

873
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:35,119
you put a zip code somewhere in Canada
and then you write the rest the address

874
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,349
in something like Russian not using them

875
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:42,849
but India Graham script rather than
English and then when you get to the

876
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:46,609
Canadian like postal service that have
someone who could

877
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:49,670
speak Russian translated and then
forwarded on to russia

878
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,770
yes yes popular e-commerce fraud right
what you could do is made for

879
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,550
a.m. Chinese code on its send it to
China

880
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:02,109
and have the just in China saying would
have your home address is

881
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:05,869
and then should in theory come back to
you who dis need I haven't thought about

882
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:07,550
Tom sending it to a

883
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:10,770
getting such a turn from other countries
so I'll I

884
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,060
not all the five try that might be
something working towards you

885
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,130
stand in the postal system for years
that's a very good idea thanks very much

886
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,480
we've got time for I got time for two
more questions and i got to ask a quick

887
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,130
comment my earlier question very very
quick

888
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:29,260
I've noticed that would post office box
it because the normal zip code

889
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:32,390
finder at the post office use and what
accompanies use

890
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,529
does not give you the correct last four
it will give you

891
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:38,930
the what would be the right it was a
street address but it won't be the

892
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,940
correct last four free PO Box

893
