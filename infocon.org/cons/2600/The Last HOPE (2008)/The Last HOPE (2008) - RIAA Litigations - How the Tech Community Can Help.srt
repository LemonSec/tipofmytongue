1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,939
I'm gonna try to keep my to up to 15 or
20 minutes

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:09,469
and I have my my friend does his email
with a web developer and not

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,130
tech consultant and he'll be trying to
keep his remarks the five or ten minutes

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,130
and they will have questions um

5
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:22,490
I I have to realize my limitations for
me to talk

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,880
excuse me could you put the house lights
back up and im those lights please

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,070
thank you I am

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:36,239
try to talk about technology here would
be kinda like a an RIAA lawyer

9
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,140
trying to talk about law Anna

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,710
I would just make a fool of myself so
I'm not gonna really try to do that now

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,050
try to confine myself to the general
subject and to what I know about

12
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,250
a1 thing I know about is who I am have
like how I got into this mess

13
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,390
%ah I'll tell you a little bit about
that because I

14
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,860
we don't usually get to talk about that
which is i'ma

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,549
commercial litigation lawyer who worked
in entertainment

16
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,679
and communications an arm

17
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:12,219
the Electronic Frontier Foundation who
are good people

18
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:15,579
but I'll have brought to my attention
about these cases and I had

19
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:20,229
a I tried to help a couple these folks I
thought well I'm a litigator am a

20
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:21,670
copyright lawyer

21
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,520
and I hate bullies and I know this is a
lot of extortion it's not really law

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,439
and let me see if I can help some of
these people on

23
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,439
the first few people didn't have time
and he got to fight it

24
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,950
order wherewithal an idea had a client
that wanted to fight back

25
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,619
and when I did that I realised the

26
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:46,569
I A had the strategic advantage they
knew anything about

27
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:49,409
what's going on across the country
because that one law firm handling

28
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,279
everything

29
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:55,789
and I do nothing I didn't know what was
going on in other cases

30
00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:00,619
or if there were any other cases so I
think it when I throw up a blog

31
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,520
world a place where we could collect
litigation information

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,840
and Tom maybe it'll help to neutralize
one of those a strategic advantages

33
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,250
and by setting up the block

34
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,850
recording industry versus the people
that wound up palm

35
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,210
served fried putting me into the a.m.

36
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:26,830
frontline this is a we are so that's how
I got into this case I'm not

37
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,660
I didn't come through it with the lever
appreciation %uh the need for file

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,480
sharing

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,619
or with some vision about the future of
the Internet I'm just an ordinary

40
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,320
I'm litigation lawyer who hates billy's

41
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,359
now I want mention briefly did great
economic imbalance

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,600
in every single case that's bright
because it

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,620
it cut it permeates everything which is

44
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,650
is no case in which is not a tremendous
economic imbalance

45
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:59,780
usually people that are being sued by
middle class

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,600
or poor people who don't have the
resources to

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,730
fight a living a federal court
litigation in a few in some cases the

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,010
people who have money

49
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,040
but even if you're a very wealthy person

50
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,220
you didn't get that way by taking a
claim

51
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,330
that you could set off a four or five
thousand dollars in spending two hundred

52
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,270
thousand dollars in legal fees

53
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,590
that you might or might not be able to
get part of that back

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,530
so for most for now it's it's not enough
that this is a gigantic cooperation

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,770
the gigantic corporations anyone have
which would be a tree

56
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,360
a tremendous mismatch against the

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,170
middle class and poor people that are
being sued but they have been doing for

58
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,480
this is these four

59
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,970
multinational corporations have to join
forces and in my opinion Colusa Lee

60
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,359
litigate their claims together
settlement together you can't make a

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,290
settlement with one of them without
making a settlement with all of them

62
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,489
and they have some guy who's the
enforcer oh who goes to the settlement

63
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,690
conferences and stuff and I guess he's
there to make sure every company tells

64
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,400
line

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,560
now I wanna briefly talk about the
technology

66
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,690
and I put technology in Coles because

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,418
it could be the lack of technology they
were talking about the way these cases

68
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,228
that people

69
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,990
assume less knowledgeable people was
some that it's got to do with download

70
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,460
every judge as soon as you're
downloading cases but

71
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,810
as many are you know that this has
nothing to do with our they don't know

72
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,229
anything about downloading

73
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,659
all they have is they have this
investigator media century

74
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:37,669
who goes on a

75
00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:41,438
a network that TV uses the a

76
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,050
than and Nutella I'll

77
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,330
protocol the arm fast-track protocol

78
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,210
and and he pretends to be

79
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,620
a member other networks like Kazaa

80
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,229
and then I'm he sees a a job

81
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:05,090
a shared files folder which he works on
the assumption that this these are all

82
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,300
folders that are these are all files

83
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,430
they're also I'm files and that they're
all he knows is their names

84
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,449
and that their and that the and many of
them could be that the same corrupt

85
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,800
files that media center itself send now

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,090
but in any event day a look at that they

87
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:29,439
they'd make a No I would ever dynamic IP
address comes through in the data packet

88
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:33,259
I and that's it that's the investigation
they may download

89
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:37,930
a sample usually six to nine songs

90
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,490
allegedly play them but they they there
it turns out that they really don't play

91
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,419
them

92
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,558
to verify that this song while
supposedly and then they turned it over

93
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:48,569
to the IAEA

94
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:52,319
yea then goes and says a subpoena

95
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,550
on the ISP says who had

96
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,629
the who paid for the band the and i cant
I would

97
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:03,849
the internet access account that access
that IP address at that date and time

98
00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,699
and you might think that would be like
the place to begin an investigation when

99
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:09,509
they get that information

100
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,710
but that's where they and their
investigation and then they soon

101
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,719
whoever the happiest person is who's a
who is %uh I P

102
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,990
who paid for that IP access cap the
internet access account so if you

103
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,419
I'm its if someone was coasting or
someone else's wireless signal

104
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:31,068
I'll the person whose wireless signal
was close to nine is the defendant no

105
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,599
losses

106
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,800
an arm thats that's it that's their
so-called technology

107
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,879
and I have my blog post with materials I
didn't want to bore you with a

108
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,210
PowerPoint presentation anything and I'm
not that

109
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,319
organize that I would know how to do
that anyhow

110
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,259
but the materials are up there and on
like I have a

111
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:57,409
a string them but documents where

112
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:01,498
sometimes they say media century was an
investigator

113
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:05,279
sometimes they say it wasn't an
investigator

114
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,139
sometimes they say it's an ex-player
sometimes they say it's not an expert

115
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,930
they will say anything in ready to

116
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,689
tried to avoid whatever the consequences
are too whatever

117
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,050
position they've taken these people have
no respect for the truth

118
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,210
so I don't know what media century is I

119
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,479
and they don't and they won't I say we
don't we don't know what it is

120
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,800
I don't know if its technological of its
not technological

121
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,389
I'm now this technology winds up to

122
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:40,529
affecting the subs in the low

123
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,270
because because they have no evidence
offended

124
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:49,359
actual person actually infringing
anybody's copyright

125
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,819
they tried to stretch the law it too big

126
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,569
areas in which this is affecting the
copyright law

127
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:59,639
is the make make them available

128
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,800
and the secondary liability making
available is this period if they came up

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,599
with

130
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,139
which has no place in the Copyright Act

131
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:13,999
which says that if you have something
available

132
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:17,309
that that make something available to
somebody

133
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,689
that could lead to a collaborative
arrangement that that's a violation of

134
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:23,469
the distribution right

135
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,139
they have no basis for this they've been
making the argument

136
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,599
feed for years iight sounds good in 2005

137
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,700
and finally we have a string of
decisions

138
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,380
as starting early this year which have
rejected the IAEA's theory

139
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,289
none of them at in the palette leather
and the most famous case

140
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,000
which was the one that resulted in that
crazy two hundred twenty thousand dollar

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,580
burger

142
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,050
in in Minnesota against the Native
American woman for

143
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,760
24 songs the judge now realizes that he
was misled by Diaa lawyers

144
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,939
and him and he was let down by the
defendant's lawyer

145
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,340
who didn't a brief the are properly

146
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,910
and he's now saying that he's probably
gonna be setting aside the verdict and

147
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,770
and having a new trial

148
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:14,420
so this is starting to be eroded but
it's still not

149
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,910
at a I appellate level secondary
liability in copyright law is pretty

150
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,209
clear because we have a recent Supreme
Court pronouncement MGM versus cracks

151
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,980
that

152
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,950
most people think nvm versus cracks
there was like this terrible

153
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,660
decision you know against file-sharing
stuff like that but

154
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,650
I really don't read it that way because
as a a veteran of copyright law

155
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:42,650
it actually sets the bar higher than
I've ever seen it set before for

156
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:46,340
secondary liability it says that you
cannot be liable

157
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,380
for someone else's I copyright
infringement

158
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,990
under secondary liability theory unless
you

159
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,030
in in intentionally induced or
encouraged them

160
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,199
now most these cases where

161
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,540
in most cases the defendant is
completely innocent

162
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,660
in some of the cases it was the
defendant's internet access account that

163
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,699
was used for file sharing

164
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,810
that be good if the butt the defendant
didn't know anything about it

165
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,300
sometimes it was in so many cases it
could have been some strange because the

166
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,390
left their signal but in some cases it
could have been

167
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,189
a child a friend I wanna their children

168
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,610
there's a lot of cases where up you know
i i

169
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,580
niece or nephew all kinds of situations
like that

170
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,500
that occur where the defendant is being
sued because something they didn't even

171
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,840
know their computer could do

172
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,100
I because so sup someone else might have
done it

173
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,440
so the ideal broach that subject

174
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,150
they stayed away from it but they've in
settlement that constantly

175
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,280
and talks the judges they're constantly
saying

176
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:58,189
that every that you're liable in your
responsible for what happens on your

177
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,890
internet access account which is
contrary to what MGM versus cracks to

178
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,280
says

179
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,069
so in not capital versus foster in
oklahoma

180
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,650
I wanna just slam them with the 68,000
thousand attorney's fees

181
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,430
one of the things he pointed to is why
he was assessing the attorney seasons

182
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,550
because they may be this

183
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,790
marginal accusation that the mothers to
be responsible for to do it is

184
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,160
infringement and he just said there's no
basis for that

185
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,280
now its CCD technology

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,439
give the lack of technology the lack of
evidence gives rise to these

187
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,950
substantive copyright law claims that
they're making but then again

188
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,220
the subtle goes back because these

189
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,970
the if these legal theories are accepted
it's going to have an enormous effect

190
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,810
on the world of technology if if the
making available

191
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,950
idea is accepted

192
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,070
I think the internet gets shut down
because the whole internet is making

193
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,980
things available

194
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,030
if I put a if I say he is a is an
article in the Wall Street Journal your

195
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,410
and I quote a paragraph from and then
put a link to it

196
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:09,209
and you go there you say what is a great
article on a printout 25 copies

197
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,330
and sana and sell them on the street
corner

198
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,550
well so you can violate the copyright
and I'm liable for making it available

199
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,310
that I ever say to you you should go
print copies and sell them on the stink

200
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:21,910
on

201
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,910
but thats that's the kind of craziness
that such a principle could could lead

202
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,620
to

203
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,840
and then the secondary liability if
you're liable for someone else's

204
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,700
official I mean back to have an enormous
effect number one except on the internet

205
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,060
because you have all these

206
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,370
companies I S p's and stuff like that
what if they're liable for

207
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,540
for a the copyright infringement by
another person

208
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,469
it could prevent they could be could
make it so that the people who own

209
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,640
computers

210
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,800
like parents might not allow their
children to have access to computers

211
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,420
but it could in its own way it because
it's always shut down the Internet

212
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,870
now Leslie I just wanna

213
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:06,210
say briefly what can the tech community
do you know I

214
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:10,260
I I have no training in technology

215
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,460
I in my office in 1991 I wish I had

216
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,200
up to 1991 I'd never even use the
computer my life

217
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,310
and I was the last person in the suite
even go near a computer

218
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,870
and only because my secretary moved to
Florida that I had

219
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,660
and I had to get might have to get
access to my documents that I

220
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,410
the timidly ventured into Word Perfect

221
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,140
and of course the the rest is history is
a is a lot of fun but I mean I don't

222
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,590
have

223
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,330
I i want the brown says cool science and
I had a pocket protector but beyond

224
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,620
those two things I

225
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,130
I have nope technology credentials so we
need help

226
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,170
now yes we need help

227
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,260
and let me tell you this economic
imbalance permeates

228
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,980
everything now what makes me

229
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,260
the leading technology lawyer and the
IAEA cases

230
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,910
well here it is in forty thousand cases

231
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,829
you know how many times a defendant has
taken the deposition

232
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,310
the expert witness the IRA's expert
witness

233
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,750
who spouts left with lives and Bologna

234
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,840
in these ribs in the reform reports that
the princess' out

235
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,300
and based on nothing this how many times
has he been cross-examined that a

236
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,240
deposition

237
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,800
once in forty thousand

238
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,970
cases once

239
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,130
how many times has anyone taken

240
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,680
the deposition up the investigator media
center is

241
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,000
0 I was trying to get the deposition of
media century

242
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,150
I had noticed the deposition I had
requested

243
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,490
the backup data and documents which we
would need

244
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,890
in order to determine the veracity in
order to be able to properly

245
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:03,230
turned over to our expert and see what
it meant and to cross-examine them

246
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,480
and the judge what was refusing to
permit us that

247
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,330
to have that and while it was still
under his consideration

248
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:16,010
the plane was then as they always do was
truly the case

249
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,550
so that we'll never get to take me he
said his deposition

250
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,950
wanna know why it probably was withdrawn
because media century

251
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,490
is under investigation in various Daisy

252
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,600
for criminal violation I've being
investigated without a license

253
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,520
and wearing United States

254
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,319
they would not advise his client under
such circumstances to take the fifth

255
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,190
amendment

256
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,210
while there is a criminal investigation
going on you cannot allow them to

257
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,570
testify at a deposition in the civil
matter

258
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:53,250
so I got further than anyone else but
now denies drug dropping the case

259
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,500
and they're claiming that it's my full

260
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,690
good and that they shouldn't be liable
for attorneys fees

261
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:04,270
because some my client who's a home
health aide was never even used the

262
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,529
computer who barely speaks English and
was never even use the computer in my

263
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:08,770
life

264
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,650
and me its I feel the base in the wrong
person

265
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,470
good so

266
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,020
yet so how can the

267
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,210
pec deck the technical community hell

268
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:27,880
we need expert witnesses

269
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,500
who worked the way the lawyers are
working either pro bono

270
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,720
are at very reduced prices to

271
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,270
on the Internet and peer to peer file
sharing on this whole media century

272
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,569
investigation

273
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,580
to show and if you read this materials

274
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,140
about that the deposition you'll see at
what God thinks it is they admit that

275
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,569
their process has no

276
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,730
never been peer-reviewed has never been
tested by anybody in hand any normal

277
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,320
case

278
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,820
they would never be allowed to put that
kinda jhung

279
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,700
into into a courtroom I we need people
who

280
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:06,130
on know about for computer forensics

281
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:09,640
and who especially a hydride because

282
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,300
they they go around and and they take
these judges who know nothing that pic

283
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,059
now then convince them of crazy things
they

284
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:20,139
1lb DIDS they convinced him that

285
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,069
the meta-data in the files proves that
they were illegally downloaded file

286
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:30,309
the I am in another case

287
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,820
in taxes they convince the judge that
because in

288
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,040
the computer automatically schedule

289
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,659
the fragmentation and the hydride that
proved that they wasn't trying to hide

290
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,140
the evidence

291
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,420
that was spoliation a member and not
believe that I mean

292
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,430
so I mean we really be the experts but
the people can't afford expects

293
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:55,700
everyday I'm I'm communicating back up
with lawyers

294
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,590
so we need reasonably priced or pro bono
experts to help out with these things

295
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,040
and on the forensics

296
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,629
and we need some people might not be up

297
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,780
expert witnesses but they can be
consultants who work behind the scenes

298
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,330
with the lawyers who don't know the
technology well enough

299
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,030
to help us prepare for depositions to
prepare

300
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,360
a and and to ask the right questions to
ask the right documents and data

301
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,190
we also need the tech community somebody
has to take the initiative

302
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,530
I whole to set up some kind of pull love
people

303
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:33,620
because the IAEA is find amusing trolls
and shells

304
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,740
an I a very reluctant to take someone
who I only know through email

305
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,860
or through Slashdot and to and to
actually

306
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,080
at or through even through grappler
which is a very fights

307
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,510
high-caliber people there but there are
trolls all over the place

308
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,840
and we certainly don't wanna hire an
expert whose work is the RIAA

309
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,050
the secretly so the for the Free
Software Foundation

310
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,720
has done it a great job forces setting
up a a

311
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,450
a fund an expert witness defense fund
wear whatever country

312
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,490
it's a 501 c3 so is tax deductible

313
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,200
anybody can contribute to it in the
money can only be used to pay expert

314
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,059
witnesses and consultants

315
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:20,629
helping defendants in these cases not
much money has been put into it

316
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,510
it's insane to me that companies that
big companies that make

317
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,160
all kinda money from the internet
haven't done anything to help the poor

318
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,330
people fighting these cases because

319
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,350
this is the front line and noms

320
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:40,700
the internet at stake and now I turn
over to my friends he made

321
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,910
at a web developer and tech consultant
then

322
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:50,910
most importantly a good friend

323
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:58,370
okay thanks ray and thank you everyone
for joining us today on this and they

324
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,120
don't talk

325
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,800
I'll just %uh speak briefly about their
mind valve mint with

326
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:08,320
this with these cases I let me just plug
in my Mac over here first so you can see

327
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,700
what

328
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:15,700
to some other visual aids that I have

329
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:22,429
alright so my involvement with ray
started about three years ago

330
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,470
at the onset of the you mg versus

331
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:29,880
Lindauer case and as we mentioned she's
a a home health care worker

332
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,160
who doesn't speak English if I my is
that correct

333
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,679
not well now well I'm so

334
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,780
like back on

335
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,070
I'm it's not and not some porn yet I'll
I can

336
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:49,389
read it back to you guys I'm but let me
let me start with the

337
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,850
brief background so this woman who

338
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,900
a basically got sued for

339
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,410
file sharing a whole bunch of songs not
a lot of women like her

340
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,580
hip-hop songs and rap and and stuff like
that like the usual story

341
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,960
of an elderly person in a suit for file
sharing things that she probably has no

342
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,380
idea about

343
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,700
on so let me start with some love the on

344
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:16,110
so the quotes from industry figures and
what they say

345
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,330
I'm your summer things that they
characterize

346
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,370
people that that use mp3 devices

347
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:27,450
so doug morris on the pub picture him
here

348
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,660
from this

349
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,950
is doug morris he is

350
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,690
the CEO Universal Media up

351
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,070
Universal Media Group 10 a.m. he

352
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,270
says abouts people that have mp3 devices

353
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,850
basically where thieves you know these
devices are just repositories have

354
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,210
stolen music

355
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,200
and that's what he says that is that is
completely insane

356
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I mean I M

357
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,679
right of course you know but this is how
he characterizes

358
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,010
people have iPods creatives you know

359
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:12,309
creative mp3 players zulan

360
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:15,428
ride yes right most people you know

361
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:19,730
snow there are some people who put on
songs to the dollar from somewhere

362
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,640
illegally but that most people just put
their CDs on they don't carry around the

363
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,210
whole 12

364
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,350
discs in there bag when they go out to
to the train whatever it is

365
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:36,110
right so this is another call from Jen
for paris sur who is a a

366
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,890
the head litigator for Sony and she says
when

367
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:43,210
you make a copy of your music the you
actin

368
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,820
we can that they can say he stole the
song its you this is how

369
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,860
these industry figures are
characterizing people have mp3 players

370
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,429
and music lovers this is how they are
characterizing us to the press

371
00:22:55,429 --> 00:22:58,470
to the courts and to the general public

372
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,630
and I think this is wrong you know it's
it's very destructive

373
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,420
and its arm it's very hurtful to
technology and innovation

374
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,920
on to say that i pod is just the big
repository for stolen music is just

375
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,650
insane and observe

376
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,200
okay so that's a that's done more issues
the in

377
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,130
the bad guy this nice guy is this
handsome fellow

378
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,260
is a doctor doctor jacobson who is on

379
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,940
I don't know if you can see the whole
entire screen here just

380
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,540
go back to the moment okay he is the
expert witness store the so-called

381
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,889
expert witness for the RIAA

382
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,130
I he is a University the

383
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,940
everything is I were here yes I was the
University

384
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:48,400
computer scientist so-called expert
witness in these are a

385
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,740
cases butts some I use the word

386
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,840
expert the very loosely because he has
no potentials whatsoever

387
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,070
arm he is not certified by any
professional

388
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,620
body in the party's

389
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:06,049
his deposition here

390
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:09,840
so I was at the mmm so as Ray said

391
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,199
we we'll we're the only ones that
actually deposed the

392
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,330
RIAA RIAA expert on

393
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,020
and the C word here we go

394
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,020
so as you can see your YouTube by ray
asked arm

395
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,480
Jacobson by what body are you certified
as an engineer

396
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,290
and his response was by no professional
society

397
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,629
you know is there any organization a
surefire you as an engineer

398
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,070
his answers no that

399
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:45,780
so basically the bullshit artist so he
was fielded

400
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,610
and about liar let me get to that he's a
you'll say anything that the RIAA once

401
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,870
and say he's basically a whore

402
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,559
he'll makeup on you know he'll say
anything that they will get unpaid you

403
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,200
know he's

404
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,570
he's not a computer scientist he's not a
credited

405
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,840
the member above the scientific
community

406
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,120
you know so you members and the

407
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,140
any pure regulated society or you
recognize by any

408
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,429
in history industry groups and his is no
I do not have a

409
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:22,270
on professional engineering license so
he's basically abortions

410
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,950
and a scary thing is that he teaches
classes on on the stuff on

411
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,000
engineering that working on

412
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,500
so but back to his his sort of %uh his
lack of credentials and the Doppler test

413
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,200
so in court maybe reagan explains lil
bit better since he's the lion I'm not

414
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,730
on expert witnesses basically have to
fulfil certain requirements to be

415
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,799
considered

416
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,080
experts and to me to have their
testimony handed in court

417
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,990
basically one requirement is that the

418
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,030
that their results and findings are
scientific and that they are

419
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:58,450
they their methods have been subject to
peer review and

420
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:02,640
scrutiny by the tech community I'm
Andrey what are some other dow Burke i

421
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,059
neva

422
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,370
things that this was to be testing the
supposed

423
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:09,600
testing for a false positives

424
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,770
must be publishing

425
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,820
peer review its first have been to
afsane

426
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,990
he testified that he he alright with

427
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:23,450
where did you learn it I thought to
myself

428
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,250
has it ever been published now is it
ever been period has it ever been

429
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,160
anything

430
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,059
and the answer was no everything and
then when I asked about media centuries

431
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:33,580
methods I S in the same

432
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,740
question he he didn't have any clue and
of course they've never have been

433
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:44,230
and are the judge ruled that he could
testify anyway

434
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:47,850
so arm he's basically

435
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,150
he's basically a pale I for the RIAA in
in all these

436
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:55,470
you know these cases he's the expert
witness it's alright

437
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:01,620
very most of these cases all all

438
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,020
house stuff

439
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,820
probably some these judges are very very
tact illiterate

440
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:14,010
their even ha style to is to something
so we ask for and the things that we say

441
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,460
what he does have going for me is he's a
partner

442
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,299
with the company that manufactures the
audible magic filtering software

443
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:26,379
which is being sold to the universities
and other

444
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,380
a LAN operators as a way of getting ERA
to stop suing

445
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,540
so in other words if he didn't get a
penny as an expert witness

446
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,260
he's making a funnel money from the
threat these losses

447
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,419
they got Ohio University they targeted
Ohio University is one of the

448
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:45,230
university's they were targeting

449
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:49,960
and then when Ohio University agreed to
write out exactly his

450
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,950
business partner 76,000 our

451
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:57,370
the sixty thousand dollars for the
software and sixteen thousand dollars

452
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:59,880
for the first year's main

453
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,429
no more lame number let no more letters

454
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:06,679
no more DMCA notices so this guy

455
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:12,250
is going around helping the lawsuits
which helped make him what kinds money

456
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,730
right so there's a there's the its is in
his self-interest to keep spewing these

457
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,700
lies and so on this software that
basically is just boo do I we don't know

458
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,919
what it does

459
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,520
he says he's the chief technology
officer palisades systems which makes

460
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,168
this

461
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,890
audible magic God network the

462
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,179
detection kinda algorithm or software

463
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,600
which would monitor p2p networks on
campuses and

464
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,100
schools not something you see modest

465
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,990
yep that that's that's what I would say
were a whore

466
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,830
I'm and if you try to actually go to his
home page it doesn't actually there's

467
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,530
nothing in there

468
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,428
so I've maybe to be down for fear of us
kinda packing your

469
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:57,150
making him the batter just seeing as
bullshit basically

470
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:04,150
and the back someone has a question

471
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,900
yes

472
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,840
excuse me yes excuse me for being naive
of

473
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,720
if I'm in jury selection I find sure or

474
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,190
who I believe is either compromised or

475
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:26,010
of in any way

476
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,110
going to jeopardize the outcome my

477
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,559
my trial weather on the defense or or
the or or 38 the prosecuting attorney

478
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,950
all I have a method in which to

479
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,809
eliminate them from the jury similarly
improve witness

480
00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:46,470
is unreliable or you know it centered
centered Center

481
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:49,890
I can there are methods I soon to get
used to

482
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,570
make that witness believable

483
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,129
why is that the case that if all these
things are supposed to be true about

484
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,440
expert witnesses

485
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,549
that this up my 9

486
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:09,750
can still up can still have such an
effect on these trials

487
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:14,030
there are no trials I don't know what
you're referring to there's been only

488
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,990
one trial

489
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,419
that where so these are congressional

490
00:30:19,419 --> 00:30:23,480
I mean the the RIAA

491
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,090
he as I mentioned their typical scenario
is to discontinue

492
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:34,110
case before the trial are

493
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,380
you judge right

494
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,370
I my guess I'm gonna speak with a bit
longer than I intended

495
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:45,960
really wants me not to speak as much but
I'll

496
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,230
this guy is doctor polls he's a arm

497
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,340
assistant professor at Delft University
Technology in the Netherlands

498
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,750
and basically hy-vee he's one of the
experts that we relied upon to discredit

499
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,750
doctor jacobson

500
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:04,100
and he calls Jacobson basically
borderline incompetent

501
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,040
I which I would I would have to agree
with because someone is

502
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,549
you know his methods Doug jacobson's
methods are

503
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:15,790
untested their unpublished to his own
making and he doesn't even follow proper

504
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,418
scientific gone

505
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,440
procedure this is a

506
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,480
I'll printout from the Incase forensics
website this is one of the

507
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,910
main tools used by on consultants and
law and the law field

508
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:32,730
who do hard drive forensics and as you
can see on

509
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,780
number forty years as document findings

510
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,000
you know that is what you have to do
when you do any kind of a scientific

511
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,740
inquiry

512
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:43,070
the scientific method you might have
learned in elementary school you know

513
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,740
how to devise an experiment

514
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,100
to you know you record your procedures
you document everything so that other

515
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,250
people can verify what you've done

516
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,460
for accuracy and they can reproduce the
results either

517
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,300
confirm when you found or two refuted
your findings

518
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,950
so what doctor jacobson when we asked if
he produced any kind of documents

519
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:10,950
that's what he says

520
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,019
its keys concerned

521
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:18,679
kid

522
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:24,259
me find here okay here we go

523
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:28,580
do you generate any reports %uh is one
really has to missus no

524
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:34,199
now I'm not asking people not reports it
was a masking the general reports

525
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,509
is no now how do you do forensics
without generating reports I don't know

526
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:40,239
what he was looking at um

527
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:43,899
so home so he says you know we've

528
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:48,039
we didn't find anything so there's
nothing to document so

529
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,139
let's see I examine the hard drive
through examine the hard drive found no

530
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:55,210
evidence of file-sharing software audio
file so there's nothing document

531
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:59,299
so basically we have no idea what he did
what kinda procedures followed

532
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,668
what I've investigation he he conducted
the

533
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:06,169
there's no scientific basis for any of
his stuff he's just the

534
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:09,779
I I don't know the even look at the hard
drive frankly

535
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:15,299
I months all that's that's the kind of
science

536
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:19,029
you know he kinda response this is a

537
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:22,559
for now from a elementary school in that

538
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,849
tenses up okay

539
00:33:25,849 --> 00:33:30,499
number four writer procedures tell what
you did with the hotel write down

540
00:33:30,499 --> 00:33:31,729
everything this is what beach

541
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:34,769
each thing that you do numbered step in
order to read anything you do

542
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:38,509
others should be able to repeat the
experiment by reading the procedures

543
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,999
get this is something that they teach to
you know ten-year-olds

544
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:46,629
so you know he's on jacobson's basically

545
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:50,139
you know he's he's subic back I

546
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:53,179
here's I'll its wrap up in a bit

547
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,840
on an open up the floor to questions but
let me just pull a perfume other things

548
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,450
some the

549
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,710
wacky knows that he says arm

550
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,879
so in all these cases the RIAA says that
the

551
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:08,710
defendant No did not have a wireless
router and you can see why they would

552
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,349
say that

553
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:13,599
you know they they want a preemptive the
possibility of a defense that says that

554
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,869
it was open wireless network and weeds
come on and serve on the signal and

555
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,629
do all kinds of things and the owner
would be the owner of the account will

556
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:22,279
be blamed

557
00:34:22,279 --> 00:34:26,579
so um we asked doctor jacobson how he

558
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:29,589
knew that there was no wireless network
on

559
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:33,049
used by the defendant

560
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:38,770
okay so we ask them you know he and his
yes is currently does an IP address tell

561
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:39,299
you

562
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:45,619
devices wired/wireless is no that that's
the correct answer

563
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:49,159
on at sea now now no doubt you

564
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,960
a few more pages on and yours is
nonsense explanation now he says

565
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,730
now use a wireless router and there's no
how do you know there's no wireless

566
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,040
he says again by looking at the exhibits
6

567
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,880
ok exhibits 6 is this a

568
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,170
this exhibit is just a long distance for

569
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,859
meta-data and I don't know how you can
tell that this is a

570
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,130
not a wireless network been looking is
meta-data have

571
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,690
on his you know mp3's I don't see where
it says

572
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,809
not on a wireless network arm

573
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:25,410
I see some destination and source IP
addresses

574
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,500
by you know it's just the IP address and
port

575
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:34,220
which I'm as you know from basic
networking you cannot find out his

576
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,799
a devices behind a router how many
devices there are what kind of devices

577
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:43,359
you just you just have to public
Internet address important

578
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,819
I'm so here's is nonsensical I'm

579
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:52,308
nonsensical explanation on again these
are all public IP addresses on both the

580
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:55,450
computer and the device to put the IP
packet on the Internet

581
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:58,578
both at the same IP I'm

582
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,779
and if you can understand that I'm

583
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:05,700
I'm I'm hopeful that you can explain it
to me and make sense of his

584
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,510
kind bullshit here I'm now as he was
giving me this bullshit explanation at

585
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,160
the deposition he looks over to me
nervously and I

586
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,750
I noticed that he was trying to figure
out if I was

587
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,579
going to react in some way so he doesn't
really she poker face also he he knew he

588
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:22,440
was lying

589
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,359
when said that you find out your he gets
he says he determines the wireless or

590
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:27,970
wired

591
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,000
network so he he's he's a bad liar in a

592
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,339
that poker face arm and see if I have
any more things

593
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:41,440
here's another okay this is my final
thing now

594
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,299
open up the floor discussion this is
from

595
00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:49,559
this is number Verizon this is the from
you when

596
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:52,740
the RIAA subpoenaed horizon for their
arm

597
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,040
for their IP addresses and who was

598
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,690
like given who was assigned as IP
address now notice here

599
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:03,510
this is from their customer service tool
nice you want some problems in the sea

600
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:04,450
missing image

601
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,210
okay that's obviously broken on their
your website

602
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:12,960
you see errors you see different kind
missing images here

603
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,839
and you also see something very
interesting reading to learn Texas

604
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:19,880
750 38 as the zip code now that's

605
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:24,380
serving Texas and this woman is the
resin a Brooklyn

606
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,690
know why they have a Texas address on
here

607
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:31,329
that is complete was our you know and
there's

608
00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,130
in here in this test results there's
errors recorded but

609
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,270
you know there's no there's no
explanation for what they are

610
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,650
what they might be and there's no
attempts by

611
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:46,150
the the plaintiffs to verify this I mean
this is obvious red light when you have

612
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,220
someone

613
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,829
good who is in taxes are you know that
that's that

614
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:54,950
would makes you sort of question the
validity of this report

615
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:58,020
on so this was some kind some love the

616
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,160
the crap that the

617
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,730
that the record companies are presenting
to the judges and

618
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,890
saying hey this is evidence this is what

619
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,950
proves that this person was downloading
or uploading files

620
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,089
but its these these companies have

621
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:17,299
all his money and they can just throw
documents thats

622
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:21,670
the judges then they'll buy it you know
they've been very high style to us

623
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:25,859
%ah on because we're where defending
people that don't have a lot of money

624
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,619
don't know resources

625
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:31,619
and years with the big dividend a
lifetime thing we're it's not bill

626
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:32,559
struggle

627
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,630
we can't even get media century to he
was wanted information about their

628
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:38,680
investigation because

629
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:42,140
this but I think that it's just a whole
bunch of us smoking mirrors they they

630
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,400
really don't have a process that's
that's

631
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,650
reliable thats scientific it's just

632
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,819
probably some some guy that they're
painted

633
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:54,599
get on cuz I and in just six min shots
and just take hundreds and hundreds of

634
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,920
screenshots

635
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,630
but it's a black box we don't know what
the process is one on Howell

636
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:03,059
how inaccurate as and from looking at
some these documents you know they don't

637
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:04,369
make any attempt to

638
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:08,650
to verify any the state and there's no
scientific credibility there

639
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:12,410
arm and i think thats now opened up the
questions now

640
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:16,259
answerable punchan believe fire away

641
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,839
you wanna know more about this and I'm

642
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:24,910
for future research on the

643
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,890
the ER my blog it recording industry
versus the people

644
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,879
that's where you can I'm meet up on
these

645
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,439
on these documents

646
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:45,319
so ROM take hope is like 26 years old

647
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:49,509
well 2600 is its 26 years old

648
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:52,709
focus was 18 years old something like
that

649
00:39:52,709 --> 00:39:56,799
the reason I ask is this up we all talk
about these

650
00:39:56,799 --> 00:40:00,009
I don't need to be a just we all talk
about these cortical

651
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:03,459
judges third don't know anything about
technology

652
00:40:03,459 --> 00:40:06,669
and we all know that's gonna change
relatively soon

653
00:40:06,669 --> 00:40:11,859
now judges are not supposed to take
kickbacks

654
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:16,808
so where you guys is or anyone in the
room when you guys thoughts about how

655
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:18,209
long it will take before

656
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:23,698
judges become a little bit more here
judges objectors are becoming more aware

657
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:28,929
and the them I think they were caught
off guard i have an article coming out

658
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:33,819
a in August in the judge's Journal the
American Bar Association

659
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:38,849
the publication for judges I was invited
to write this article for their

660
00:40:38,849 --> 00:40:42,130
equal access to justice issue I

661
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,329
and it's evident that a the judges arse

662
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:50,229
in the first instance they were quite of
God they saw all these cases with big

663
00:40:50,229 --> 00:40:51,089
papers

664
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:55,038
big law firms the defendants were not
represented

665
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,189
most of the cases were ex parte de cases
where defendants weren't even notified

666
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:00,269
there was a case

667
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:03,900
the a bit when the defendants were
finally sued there were

668
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,039
default judgments there are people
showing up without letters because

669
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,989
there's no way they could afford a
lawyer

670
00:41:09,989 --> 00:41:14,329
so the judges will call of God they had
these big law firms banks

671
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:18,329
papers but it is evident that there in
the past year

672
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:21,819
the past year to it is starting to get
wise I

673
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:26,150
not all of them but more and more the
tide is turning

674
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,229
and they are going to lose

675
00:41:29,229 --> 00:41:35,369
and it is now becoming and you have a
judge who just conducted this

676
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,390
highly-publicized trial in Minnesota and
now

677
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,199
has publicly humiliated himself by
saying that we made

678
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:47,229
that he committed a manifest

679
00:41:47,229 --> 00:41:50,630
ever law I've been in litigation feel

680
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,709
34 years I have never seen that happen
before

681
00:41:53,709 --> 00:41:57,698
never so I having things like like

682
00:41:57,699 --> 00:42:01,439
feels quite knowing how he would that he
was misled by these lawyers

683
00:42:01,439 --> 00:42:05,598
and when he wrote that decision he
didn't even know

684
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,449
that he had been misled on something
even more serious

685
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,880
because the nature of his having been
misled was the

686
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,049
failure to bring to the judge's
attention

687
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:19,909
a controlling contrary authority that
the other side

688
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:23,219
shouldn't brief but incompetently did
not carry

689
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:28,329
well that's something that a lawyer

690
00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:32,049
you might almost say well that's kind of
a technical thing that's one of those

691
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,979
rules that's a little hard to live with

692
00:42:33,979 --> 00:42:38,339
telling a judge that is that authority
against your client's position

693
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:43,459
it's required up us button nobody really
wants to do that

694
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:47,808
but they did something even more extreme
that the judge didn't know about

695
00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:52,509
which is that there was the one of the
two cases they were relying on

696
00:42:52,509 --> 00:42:56,319
had been reversed the week earlier had
the judge

697
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,669
in that case had vacated his decision
and they didn't tell the judge

698
00:43:01,669 --> 00:43:05,229
they had an obligation to tell the guys
and they didn't

699
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:08,519
and the judges a going to be

700
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,709
live in I the minister Duluth News
Tribune asked me to write something

701
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:16,969
a and I wrote something because there's
a

702
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,489
all argument coming up in on august
fourth and I said

703
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:25,269
I I close my article by saying if you
wanna see a federal judge

704
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:31,199
whose hopping mad be in the Duluth
federal courthouse on August 4

705
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,679
at 10 a.m. K next question

706
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:38,390
arm I'll make a comment first

707
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,819
arm I've noticed that even newer lawyers
are not exactly what I'd call

708
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:47,369
technically competent on I found out the
last coming I got from

709
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,869
fellow colleague was when I was using
Ubuntu at work he said

710
00:43:50,869 --> 00:43:54,270
that's a legal up

711
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,580
okay it's not common aside I'm a lawyer
I'm a techie

712
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:02,549
what can I do to help you're a lawyer
and a techie

713
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:08,390
yet you could represent some of these
people forget my car okay

714
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:14,710
going up we haven't directly with
employers II put people in there who I

715
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,040
think will help fight for these people
and a lawyer or a technical background

716
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,860
is

717
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:22,900
especially priceless what

718
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,890
work in information security people in
general counsel at the various ISP's

719
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,839
to you too combat I subpoenas DMCA
takedown notices

720
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,500
on and and like the pre litigation
settlement letters that come in

721
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,450
well the pre litigation settlement
letters have no legal standing

722
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:42,820
whatsoever

723
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,940
and I think what what I would like to
see happen

724
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,520
is I'd like to see although there are
many who say well they should just be

725
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,350
dumped in the wastebasket

726
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:57,259
artist that personally I think they're
not that important what I would like to

727
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:58,580
see i'd like to see

728
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:03,240
you negotiate with the eye and say
listen will pass these along for you

729
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,320
if you agree that as the anybody who
does not settle with you

730
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:11,420
you will not bring a secret ex party
preceding your bring a proceeding on

731
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,090
notice

732
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,120
you give us copies evolve your papers
and will transmit them to the John Doe

733
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:23,120
I would like to see that happen for
future cases are you didn't need more

734
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,339
expert witnesses and if so how can we
the

735
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:32,480
do what needs to be done become expert
witnesses well absolutely what your

736
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,410
people need to do is i'll

737
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:38,690
find the lawyers in their the closest
geographical area that are working on

738
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:39,580
these cases

739
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,330
and let them know their credentials and
their availability

740
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:47,240
and the fact that they would be willing
to read that work for a reduced fee

741
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:54,240
and I'm that's the way to do it
excellent presentation

742
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,440
and thank you so much for all your great
work shanken

743
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,730
is not a easy mechanism could be
established to go against the RIAA

744
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,830
and on so get them for damages for all
the ridiculous things they're doing

745
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,890
and I'll that mechanism help quell the
whole

746
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,850
there's no easy way to do that

747
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:19,240
arm their different causes their action
for malicious prosecution in some states

748
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,980
you could sue someone for bringing a
frivolous case eclipses actually been

749
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,480
the cause of action for damages

750
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,340
in some states you can so it varies from
state to state right now there's a class

751
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,930
action in argon

752
00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:34,640
in the tonya Anderson case they sued a

753
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,720
this young I'll woman shoes disable

754
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:43,540
she lived on social security disability
she didn't have a clue what any this is

755
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:43,960
bass

756
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,140
never done any file sharing her
seven-year-old daughter is never done

757
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,080
any file sharing

758
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,259
she begged them to stop issue of it to
let them

759
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:54,480
have her hard drive and go through it

760
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,090
verify any they said no we want the
money and we found very good liar

761
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,400
who took the case pro bono you see the
netball

762
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,720
but they're targeting the people who are
least able to defend themselves

763
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,010
and that to me is absolutely inexcusable
it's inexcusable

764
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:13,470
and that's why we need help from wall
everything

765
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:17,290
Quattro Inc get because the legal system
doesn't

766
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:21,850
ago really protect people against abuses
like that like that's why

767
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:25,069
Electronic Frontier Foundation is
pursuing this case

768
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:29,810
against the Universal Music but they
they they go do it

769
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,270
takedown notice and threatened lawsuit
over it a two-year-old advancing to a

770
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:35,110
prince song

771
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:39,910
I mean it's so important and their cases
now coming down

772
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,069
in the senate several come down in the
seventh circuit

773
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:46,250
saying that when a defendant

774
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,650
when I read it went well not the RA when
the plaintiff in a cabaret case drop

775
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:51,410
staircase

776
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:55,430
it's very very important for the
defendant to get the attorney's fees

777
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:59,160
because the plaintiffs have all kinds of
economic incentives

778
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,490
they have big library have a portfolio

779
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:06,230
copyrights the defendant has no
incentive they just got this one case

780
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,090
you have to give them attorneys

781
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,360
him I heard that

782
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,380
RIAA being brought up on charges of
racketeering

783
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,320
since I heard that I haven't heard
anything else about it

784
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,880
have you were anybody else yes well

785
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,560
it's not going anywhere I mean the I was
starting to tell you about the case if

786
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,140
Anderson versus Atlantic

787
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,400
work on Anderson brought a class action
and she

788
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,870
she brought it on various causes a
vaccine but the judge didn't feel that

789
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:40,509
there was a good enough RICO claim and
had to be taken out

790
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,950
now maybe they can come back with that
information later but

791
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:48,130
very technical to prove Rico and almost
every cause a vaccine you could bring

792
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,430
against them

793
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,710
is very technical very difficult
recently I was

794
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:56,140
researching the Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act

795
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,770
because as to those defendants whose
computer are

796
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,880
was actually access which is possibly
less than half

797
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,330
as to them don't they have a good claim
under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

798
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,160
first

799
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,170
because media century without
authorization access their computer

800
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,100
but I noticed that this tax it has been
amended to provide that you have to

801
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:18,980
prove

802
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,240
that you suffered a personal injury or
to prove that you suffered five thousand

803
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,540
dollars in one year

804
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,660
in economic loss so it's going to be
very hard for people to actually satisfy

805
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,600
that statute

806
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,410
so a there aren't a lot of greats that
is now in Florida

807
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:39,629
there was a case where they
counterclaims for a

808
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:45,520
conspiracy to commit crimes now in
certain states there is such a dork

809
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,060
in other states like New York there is
no such store

810
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:52,910
in Florida the judge said that's a
legally sufficient claiming he's

811
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,549
allowing it to proceed

812
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:59,370
so you know people are are a raising
these arguments when they can but the

813
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,810
Lord is in great

814
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:04,350
in that area as we have time for one
more question so

815
00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,650
your skin just email the expensive being

816
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,160
challenged in this room I'm on the other
side of the table

817

on attorney and a techie and I work for
a major media corporation

818
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:19,350

after people

819
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,819

with your question

820
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,700

real theft

821
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,130

822
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:33,350
the IRA's litigation campaign

823
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:37,170
against these forty thousand people has
never found a real

824
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:41,010
a real faith real pirates cleaver not
requires good

825
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:44,530
will not use because of that's right

826
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:48,920
