19
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,810
hacking the media by laughing at them by

22
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:29,570
I'm yes oh this is hacking the media by
laughing at them it's quite easy to

23
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,939
laugh at the media these days I'm
sometimes you open up the new york times

24
00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:37,090
and you feel like you're reading the
onion

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,490
on just a quick hi

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:46,729
background I'm in 1995 I started

27
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:49,880
a nationally syndicated technology
feature called the techno file

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,890
I 1995 nobody really

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,189
was talking about the Internet and
technology on the radio

30
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,680
except for you know I'm annual I but on
commercial radio I was working at a rock

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,890
station here in New York and the program
director said hey you know a lot about

32
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,780
computers

33
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,220
why don't you out you know gone the
morning show I do like a

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,340
a quick feature every day about you know
what but what you think school

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,370
so we started that in february ninety
five in the faxes role then cuz the

36
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,260
course nobody had

37
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:20,859
email and we had %uh this fax machines
that was one long roll

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,860
and people wrote in some really positive
responses like

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,010
shut up and play Pearl Jam I am

40
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,149
can I have a nerve on iraq block

41
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,500
I but it was officially inducted into
the museum a television and radio

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,709
I was on the air up until July of last
year in which I

43
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:43,209
retired its I could focus full-time on
making video games

44
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,780
I which happen if which

45
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,849
I'm not too surprising actually pay a
little bit better than

46
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,329
radio I I was also technology writer for
many years

47
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,420
I wrote for Playboy magazine and I had a
syndicated column

48
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,750
there was based out of the Long Island
Press also call the techno file

49
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,010
also I had a company called radial as
low which is still in business it's %ah

50
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,840
an independent production company
produce radio commercials TV commercials

51
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,909
arm when the economy sort of tanks and
people stopped advertising after 2001

52
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,650
now the only people in town were video
games

53
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,019
and %uh pharmaceutical companies and so
we did a lot of really exciting

54
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,470
pharmaceutical videos

55
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:32,140
at that time I learned a lot about
erectile dysfunction

56
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,409
I'm which you know if if you're
concerned the world is gonna and you

57
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,500
just may need to get laid right before
and

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,430
and and in 2001 I met the guys a
rockstar games and started out working

59
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,379
on the ground that our titles

60
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:48,870
and thats I've worked on everyone sense
Grand Theft Auto 3

61
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,450
I'm so I want to talk about

62
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,459
hacking the media by laughing at them
it's very difficult to

63
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:00,530
get your voice heard in the media today
and I wanted to

64
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,519
sort of give an overview of what's
happened with the media in the last few

65
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,590
years

66
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,590
and then I talk about

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,099
how you can make inroads and having your
voice heard

68
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,239
but so we get serious for just a moment

69
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,250
what's the most important issue in the
media today

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm celebrity vaginas

71
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,449
really seems to be what people are
interested in

72
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:33,310
I I think if I bin Laden had a vagina
the paparazzi would have found my now

73
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,750
I am it's a

74
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,330
it is amazing to me how the media has
been taken over by the pop Arazi

75
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:49,080
I you watch CNN and across the bottom it
says TMZ reports

76
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,419
I don't give a shit what TMZ reports

77
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:59,820
I'm media consolidation is one of the
issues and reasons that were sorted

78
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,990
at the roads that we are the crossroads
we're at today

79
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,310
and people are always sort of moaning
about about media consolidation

80
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,919
I am for entertainment purposes it's
kind of irrelevant

81
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,039
because let's be honest there's bigger
issues then

82
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,210
what channel lost is on I

83
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,979
and the good entertainments gonna make
it through no matter what channel

84
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:26,690
its own the good ideas get shop to
various networks in various locations at

85
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,229
the networks say go to hell

86
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:31,490
they publish it online at the networks
eventually come around and say oh wow we

87
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,169
should've picked that up

88
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,169
but we're getting to the point where the
channels debt with DVR's

89
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,229
video iPods arm

90
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,570
time 15 all this technology I

91
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,680
it's been specially with like HBO on
demand and and all the on-demand

92
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,520
channels

93
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,870
I don't really care what channel lost is
on I just don't want to have to wait for

94
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,400
the next episode

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,009
so I just might download it I

96
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:04,060
TV viewership has been dropping this
year TV viewership is down almost 10

97
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,300
percent

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,819
and

99
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,319
now they are they have course found a
way to blame

100
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,610
the unions and the creatives on this
they said well it's because the writers

101
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,650
strike

102
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:21,600
those damn riders you know who were
hoping to get compensated for all their

103
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,990
works being put on line for sale

104
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,530
I they're the reason that TV viewership
is dropped we know differently

105
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,750
I'm radio listenership is down which

106
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,039
quash shock I am

107
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,940
when I had the techno file I is pretty
much my full-time job and doing video

108
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,400
games on the side a lot of this

109
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,350
stations I was on where Clear Channel
stations which will have joy dealing

110
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,430
with these people

111
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,960
I am you know the average spot was about
60 seconds sometimes there be thirty

112
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,449
seconds in order to run the techno file
would send commercials along with it and

113
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:55,750
say

114
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,210
run the commercials and will run and you
can run the a feature that's how

115
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,060
syndication works

116
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,310
so clear channel said art we've bought
twelve hundred stations

117
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,400
but we're losing listeners it's got to
be the commercials

118
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,900
so they say no more sixties will run
thirties

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,729
the ratings keep going down there like
okay it's got to be this MTV generation

120
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,090
which there has been an MTV generation
in a while I am

121
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,449
I think that the the rest have it in
this room I am

122
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,680
the MTV generation got short attention
span so we're gonna we're gonna do

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,699
twenty second commercials

124
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,130
so course for people have syndicated
shows is kinda a pain in the ass to get

125
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:35,280
twenty second commercials

126
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,889
then they go down to fifteens and
intense

127
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,080
and they keep losing listeners so
finally they say

128
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,080
what we're gonna do is on some stations
tryout just get rid the commercials

129
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,289
entirely

130
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,690
and just have the DJ's work it into
conversation

131
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,740
so they'll come back from break and be
like hey there was no arrive la ca va

132
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,190
pearl jaybob

133
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,199
I do feel that pressure jail I am

134
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,479
and they're shocked why people are
tuning in to this they've homogenized

135
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,560
entertainment

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,289
I but again we thought that the media
consolidation

137
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,210
was going to be the absolute death radio
Clear Channel's now him urging stations

138
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,530
left and right because they're not
making money

139
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:19,650
because they suck the life out of him
I'm time online is obviously increased

140
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,599
because you're looking for something now
more entertaining than a pearl jam rock

141
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:23,690
block

142
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,990
and video games are now a clip see
movies

143
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,860
I earlier this year I had the I was
fortunate enough to

144
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,120
be part of a project on that in one week

145
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,120
grossed more than any movie in history I
am

146
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,430
when it when we were looking at you know
all of the top entertainment products

147
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:50,680
arm and their one-week sales

148
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,410
you know the Harry Potters in so for
that I couldn't believe that like second

149
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,670
place was pirates of the Carribean

150
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,089
which like I could even fall that movie
there's a square in a dice game and were

151
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,610
under water and there's a ghost in

152
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:09,660
I am the thing that is bad about me to
consolidation obviously

153
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,100
is that news is shifting focus I am

154
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,660
it is profit before in the quote-unquote
good old days

155
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,029
you were given a signal and as part of
your duty

156
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:25,019
and in exchange for that signal you had
to report the news

157
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,130
and news lost money and they were happy
to lose money

158
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,730
because that was what kept them on the
air if they had those news broadcast the

159
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,320
naked

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,540
put up stuff like Mary Tyler Moore and
make a lot of money

161
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,969
I'm so what they've done now is they've
made it a for-profit entity this is why

162
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,630
you've got cable channels

163
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,950
that are so highly NICHD in targeted
targeted

164
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,420
I the only way that you gain profit is
by target marketing which means

165
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,019
you're changing your news I and back to
the

166
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:59,310
celebrity vaginas um The Associated
Press

167
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,550
has hired 30 new reporters but they
didn't come out a journalism school they

168
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,459
came out have

169
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:08,930
chase after Lindsay Lohan hand school I

170
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,350
they they literally have higher 30 pop
Arazi because

171
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,589
The Associated Press is about selling
articles to

172
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,240
newspapers to various publications
online and

173
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,940
what is selling right now is news about
Lindsay Lohan

174
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,610
and not news about iraq

175
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm speak in Iraq CBS pulled out their
first there are full-time correspondent

176
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,250
still got a war going over there CBS
doesn't have a full-time correspondent

177
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,690
om Katie Couric Wow what an awesome

178
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:47,100
journalist this woman is I'm

179
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,329
I it really amazes me when she went from
my

180
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,430
telling us how to pack healthy lunches
for our kids and what your dream wedding

181
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,519
is

182
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,649
I to talking about r4i was like what
what a great

183
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:04,040
exchange that was I'm and

184
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,490
strangely a nielsen now reports that the
CBS Evening News has the worst

185
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,260
radians him the show's history I

186
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,589
a new New York a reporter named Nancy
Franklin I

187
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,339
did it amazing article about this I
suggest that you look at it online

188
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:25,700
I she pointed out that people might
actually watch the evening news

189
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,890
if they call people out when they lied
when they call politicians out on their

190
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,130
bullshit if they had

191
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,430
one little gray am up that Michael Moore
gene

192
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,649
that said let's call people out on their
BS I am

193
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:45,600
instead what we get are this amazing
five-minute piece where they've got a

194
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,060
crack team of reporters outside the
Exxon Mobil station

195
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,079
zooming in on the signing going gas is
high

196
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:57,589
no shit dude didn't did need a five
minute to expose about that with the

197
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:04,589
the witty comments from people filling
up their gas going it show is expensive

198
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,930
you go back to the Associated Press at
the washington bureau chief Ron forty-a

199
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,320
is said that the Associated Press is
moving away from traditional journalism

200
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,610
this is scary stuff folks now you can
have first person an emotive language

201
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,579
that's all okay

202
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,899
up and there's no more equal treatment
for both sides

203
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,430
we're seeing this a lot in so-called
journalism and news

204
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,010
and it makes it hard to break through
about the Walter Cronkite thing appear

205
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,329
because it does highlight have

206
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:39,339
at my career on the tackle file was Tom
I got to sit down and have lunch with

207
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,450
walter cronkite and asked him how he
felt about the internet news on the

208
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,260
internet he just shook his head

209
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,110
and he's helped her big trouble

210
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,950
I'm what we've got now on that on

211
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:56,760
on the news and in the media are shop
fess it's not a discussion

212
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,000
it some blow hard like Bill O'Reilly
screaming down somebody that might

213
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,230
actually have a valid point so he wins

214
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,010
and then finally blogging I'm a fan of
blogging but I think that we do need to

215
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:12,639
make a distinction blogging is not
journalism journalism is showing both

216
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:19,639
sides

217
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,149
bull journalism showing both sides
giving equal treatment

218
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,829
are journalism is a profession blogging
Sahabi

219
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:31,660
there are plenty of amazing journalist
the do blogging there's

220
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,230
20 amazing blogs that I read but I think
we need to to make that distinction

221
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:39,649
because I think the ethics of journalism
or are being driven out in the news

222
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,029
because when and we've got media profits
are in trouble so the media gets

223
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,060
desperate with

224
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:49,470
reality shows and our Grand Theft Auto
four we did some spoof commercials for

225
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,610
reality show

226
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,570
I called America's next top hooker I'm

227
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,000
and/or what's strange is every time we
do a spoof

228
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,670
in GTA it comes true in fact some other
names even

229
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:06,589
not start to get used which is our
amazing the dorm a Tron

230
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:10,350
lose weight while you sleep it's just
insane I

231
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,490
and now we have news about reality shows
what my favorite bits is

232
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,760
when a reality show segways into the
evening news sometimes the first story

233
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,170
the lead story

234
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,410
is about what happened on the reality
show and some knuckleheads were at a bar

235
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,500
watching that reality show

236
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,889
and again the target market news if your
target marketing news

237
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:32,110
that means that your changing and
adapting what's your reporting so you

238
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:36,480
can appeal to a certain demographic so
you can sell pharmaceuticals to them

239
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,180
I and then sensational stories it

240
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,320
it's amazing to me how many articles and
how many

241
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,880
stories on the TV are about are you kids
gonna get kidnapped

242
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,250
find out tonight they always get into
the kids are your kids safe

243
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:58,470
are you a PITA filing don't know it I am

244
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:04,209
should plug in my audio here

245
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:11,209
memento

246
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,760
I'm so the question is how do we get the
real issues discussed

247
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,269
I'm I propose that you act immediately
comedy the

248
00:15:19,269 --> 00:15:23,000
techno file dealt with a lot of stuff
that most people

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,589
are out in america the eyes would glaze
over the determining Copyright Act

250
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:32,000
who this guy bernie S was I the Child
Online Protection Act discussing these

251
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,769
in a way that makes sense to people

252
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,050
eyes difficult sell when you open up
with comedy

253
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,769
in a feature like that use or upset
people at ease

254
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:45,000
and then you explain it in the way that
somebody a middle america mom from Ohio

255
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,570
can understand how does this affect me
and how does it

256
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,810
affect the future the techa file

257
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,000
was on Rush Limbaugh and Fox News did
load when they got a commercial break

258
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,600
it would be me which just shocked the
hell outta me I

259
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,540
and I would get email from people that
were fans a rush and fans a Fox News

260
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,760
tell me more about this DMCA

261
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,290
I'm you know I'm I'd I sleep in the back
to my cabin I liked it

262
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,390
you know I am I make God copies the
DVD's I have at home MI a felon

263
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:18,120
and I said yes stay away from the math

264
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,949
I'm and it seems like these days the
only media they're holding politicians

265
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,350
feet to the fire

266
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,550
comedians and comedy shows so

267
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,019
if that's the way we go gotta go that's
the way we gotta go

268
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,660
I am S and L's done a great job for
years obscuring politicians and

269
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,430
and and issues Tom the onion when the
onion first came out I interviewed

270
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:45,500
arm the then editor Scott deckers just
like

271
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,930
believe the founder of the paper and Dom
I asked him

272
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,640
you know who have all these corporations
that you're skewing who do not go after

273
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,620
he said Disney

274
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,260
don't don't mess with Disney they be
like ninja lawyers that'll come to the

275
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,589
drop ceilings and

276
00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:02,160
stab a fool in the neck but Tom

277
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,470
since then I talked in like two or three
years ago and I reminded her that I said

278
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:11,559
that's kinda change has in it i mean the
onion scott free form to take on anybody

279
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,990
um and The Daily Show it is

280
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:21,990
you can pretty much guess that college
students

281
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,780
18 to 34-year-olds are not watching
Katie Couric

282
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,510
I they're getting their news and they're
getting their commentary from the Daily

283
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,110
Show

284
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:36,690
I who'd isn't afraid to point out that
these politicians are fully shit

285
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:42,250
but the news casters are afraid to do it
for some reason because they're afraid

286
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,850
to lose their access

287
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,740
what they're losing other ratings I am

288
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,550
so discussing that neutrality we'll see
if this works

289
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,668
I in Grand Theft Auto with the things we
always do is is make fun of those

290
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:59,450
a those news blurbs they do

291
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,720
during the seven eight o'clock hour
where they tease all the news stories

292
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,210
common we had the spoof a Fox News Grand
Vitara for was called weasel news

293
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,790
and I'm so I took what are the promos
from

294
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:16,700
weasel news if you're part of the audio
from here and

295
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,270
dropped in a little bit about that
relates to the opening up for my

296
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,120
discussion on

297
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,400
I may be how we can get net neutrality
up in front of people in a way that they

298
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,340
can understand

299
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,970
ands

300
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,030
here we go is your best friend

301
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:41,570
cherished find out tonight we saw new
slow news Liberty City

302
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,320
trusts two-tier morning chandy have in
common we've got like average

303
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,330
selling cable companies want to restrict
your right

304
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,760
to look at celebrity Chinese online find
neutrality will keep your kids safe

305
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,400
tonight at eleven are you a sex offender
fine catch

306
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,730
and weasel chopper for and six are to

307
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,590
if someone's in trouble or on fire the
weasel news chopper is Tehran top

308
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,928
reactionaries writing to train with
terrorist resolves is on the scene we

309
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:11,549
call me

310
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:14,908
youths your team for the war on terror

311
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:18,270
the weather sports we saw you

312
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,740
its thank you

313
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,740
one of my favorite things that we got to
do a grand theft auto 4 was we got a

314
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,500
spoof TV because in the next gen
consoles were actually able to put our

315
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,150
two TV stations in your safehouse that
car like over at like an hour long each

316
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,460
once a spoof of ox called weasel and Tom

317
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,210
we did a version of that that shows all
of the newscasters and it looks exactly

318
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,250
like the Fox News graphics they do in

319
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,950
that line ethnics are at it again it
shows he's black people beat each other

320
00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:01,950
with baseball bats

321
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,080
I'm keys to successful comedy it some

322
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,780
you out your put off half your audience
quickly if you're only

323
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,820
sort of making fun of one side I

324
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,139
so you have to parity with equal
enthusiasm I let's

325
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,909
let's be honest there are Democrats and
Republicans that suck

326
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:28,610
sock suck and I think when we treat I'm

327
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,790
I think when we treat one side as a
sports team

328
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,010
where you're always rooting for them and
and regardless if the players are

329
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,679
sleeping with Madonna or shooting up

330
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,490
I it doesn't really serve so

331
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,890
you known whether things will be have
always done in GTA is make fun

332
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,940
I love liberals and conservatives with
equal enthusiasm cuz they both deserve

333
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,130
to be skewered

334
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,480
arm any comedy as well as journalism

335
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,100
don't treat politicians like royalty
there's a reason that Bush started being

336
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,750
called King George

337
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,309
is because nobody would call them out on
this BS except for maybe Jon Stewart

338
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:09,990
I and with comedy you know the goal is
not to change minds it's just to get

339
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,169
people to think

340
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,809
and I think sometimes we get so fired up
about an issue

341
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:19,120
that we just won our type up a blog
entry that's five pages long

342
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,300
just about how furious and an EFT up we
think I everything is

343
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,300
I but you have to sort a step back and
realize when you're ranting at somebody

344
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,470
they're not listening I comedies viral

345
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:36,450
and I love the term viral marketing like
what gets passed around the internet

346
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,460
I've had ad agencies contact me and said
we want to hire your production company

347
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,380
could to create a viral video

348
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,520
so I said okay awesome what's the
product and it's like crest jail

349
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,720
okok what we're gonna do is we're gonna
have some kids hanging around some cool

350
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,550
look and

351
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,770
what's called him genetics I which I
guess these days means 38 but

352
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:02,809
I'm has a cool kid sitting around some
skate parks whatever may be brushes his

353
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:05,820
teeth this crest Shaler is a crest
breast strips

354
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:09,658
and then he attempts a skateboard
maneuver and racks the shit out of

355
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,590
himself and buses knots

356
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:15,330
and they're like well I think that's a
little extreme I said do the only thing

357
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,860
that's getting passed around the
internet is insanely funny

358
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,350
or somebody breaking bones

359
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,010
and it I love now how army

360
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,280
advertisers are trying to pass off viral
videos

361
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:34,860
but if you create something that's funny
that's a commentary on consumer culture

362
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,059
or society

363
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,428
it's going to get passed around the
internet quickly and finally if they're

364
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:40,610
laughing they're listening

365
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:44,149
you know it's its obeys if you go to
comedy clubs in the city and you see

366
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:48,590
exhort a political comet your gets dark
comic comic you'll see

367
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:53,389
some tourist with fanny pack some stuff
wander off up broadway

368
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:57,540
you know our very conservative looking
folks I will go and

369
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,280
but this liberal comedienne will be
telling jokes

370
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,309
and they're laughing which means that
you've opened up a dialog

371
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:12,639
om as we move away from movies is third
in the primary and and top entertainment

372
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,490
medium in this country means we have
virtual worlds

373
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,140
I'll whether its World of Warcraft irv
Grand Theft Auto sandbox games

374
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,590
Tom there's a lot of opportunity to

375
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,678
to spoof consumer culture in these games
which Tom

376
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,300
I'd have to say American stink it a lot
but boy we have nail consumer culture

377
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,270
you know a lot of people gas prices are
high people crying their eyes out that

378
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,168
they can buy the

379
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,429
freakin new iPhone I am

380
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,370
you notes bluefin media consolidation is
I want the things we didn't

381
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,720
we've always done a grand theft auto and
the pan out even American radio I love

382
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,149
this

383
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:51,230
getting emails from people that work in
radio thats

384
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,330
that I talk about how

385
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,699
dead on the spoofs in Grand Theft Auto
are you know just that

386
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,440
the stuff in between songs like are more
weird noises between songs

387
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,879
don't know what you're listening to kiss
108 you know it's like what is

388
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,889
what are we doing I

389
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:12,980
and also spoofing America's thirst for
violence and how petrified a sexy are

390
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,450
it is amazing when I toured of the
country

391
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,800
doing interviews for grand theft auto 4
and you get people asking questions

392
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,850
they were concerned about when the
talking about but you know video games

393
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,720
arms like so common call a duty which is
an amazing game

394
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,629
I they're not concerned about being able
to turn somebody's head into a red mist

395
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:40,169
they're concerned about it that guy got
laid before hand

396
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:43,260
um and again as I said at

397
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,370
these kinda interactive social
commentaries can open up dialogue

398
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:50,419
a lot of the stuff that we've done in
GTA at strangely gets up late on real

399
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:51,310
radio which

400
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:54,260
you know when you're you know that
you're doing well if you're making fun

401
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,700
of some body and there they agree with
you

402
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,620
I'm I I went to the Bonnaroo festival a
few years ago and I had this

403
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,940
a shirt that had bush on it said obey

404
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,720
along the bottom and now I was buying
ice from this

405
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,500
like local Tennessee guy he goes I like
your shirt

406
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,470
and I said I thanks and it goes people
are fuckin obey him I tell you what

407
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:23,070
last night

408
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,340
I'm and besides comedy how do we get
real issues addressed

409
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,689
I you know Jello Biafra said it become
the media

410
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,320
I am besides using comedy to make
commentary and having that passed around

411
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,370
fire earlier or as part of projects

412
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,490
on that you get in on you know letters
to the editor it seems like the only

413
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,060
people that I write letters to the
editor angry

414
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,379
old people I am and submit ideas to
magazine

415
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:53,179
you know it when I was so I started
writing for playboy

416
00:25:53,179 --> 00:25:56,840
in their tax action it it wasn't Tom

417
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,610
like they just sort of happened upon me
I set them some story ideas and

418
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,679
everybody in this room is has way more
expertise

419
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:09,389
then the majority of fop people out
there in terms of

420
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:13,570
technology writers I and in fact writers
about activism in

421
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,050
and political issues and its cool these
magazines need content badly

422
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,889
I'm so what you do is you send an email

423
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:28,120
with five story ideas but five headlines

424
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,110
what the topics about put two or three
senators under each one

425
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,750
and sin that off to a few different
publications you'll be surprised you'll

426
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,450
get contacted back

427
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:42,139
a lot of these magazines now only need
like 200 to 300 words on something

428
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:45,840
but that 100 to 300 words could inform
somebody about something and change some

429
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,350
minds to get people interested in things
like

430
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,540
2600 hacker cons net neutrality

431
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,980
I wiretapping people without warrants

432
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm also remember camera phones I

433
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,490
and citizen journalism if you see a a
cop urinating on a fire hydrant take a

434
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:04,389
picture

435
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,669
and I I and at

436
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:11,010
and don't send it to the new york times
cuz they won't care

437
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,149
send it to the New York Post and you say
well the New York Post is such a

438
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:15,389
conservative rag

439
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:19,919
yeah but that conservative Rachael have
that picture on the front page

440
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm and subsequently that couple be
disciplined

441
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,800
I'm also consider going to journalism
school whether reasons that

442
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,510
the whole journalism versus a blogging
and that

443
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,250
at all the people now that seem to be in
the media I think what a broadcast

444
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,419
school instead of journalism school

445
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:41,200
are so they know how to smile pretty for
the camera and doubts

446
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,590
sort out their hair so it doesn't blow
around while they're standing in front

447
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,750
of her king on

448
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,200
show is windy I am

449
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,200
but you there's some great journalism
schools out there the University

450
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,320
missouri's got one atop to journalism
schools Columbia

451
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,330
I'm ranks number one quite often I am

452
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,560
it's a great profession and

453
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,879
you get some affects driven into your
head that make you think when you

454
00:28:06,879 --> 00:28:10,470
when you write about giving equal time
to both sides

455
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,800
the other thing is consider writing for
a local paper

456
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,740
you know if you live in in podunk
arkansas any right for local paper

457
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,950
love those papers are online now in its
amazing on news aggregation web sites

458
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,810
like Google News

459
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:28,760
you'll see like a topic and several
stories the number two storey

460
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,669
will be an article that's from Kentucky
in a small little paper

461
00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:38,169
that's a big deal that that writer who
was exposed to

462
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,940
to three thousand people in their local
community who wrote a really good

463
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,780
article

464
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,908
is now being exposed to a ton of people

465
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:49,950
so consider writing for your local paper
I

466
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:53,100
also I love all these experts I

467
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,700
for interviews and just from the nature
doing the techno filing Grand Theft Auto

468
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,550
and stuff

469
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,389
I I tend to get a lot of calls for these
but you when you watch

470
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,419
the the cable news broadcasts and stuff
like that

471
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,260
he started noticing a pattern but as
they get the same knuckle heads over and

472
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,139
over

473
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:13,669
to talk about are you know whatever a
certain topic I Valley got an expert

474
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,120
here likewise an expert well cuz we call
them

475
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,129
and here he is and he's got a microphone
I'm

476
00:29:22,129 --> 00:29:26,149
these these public like newspapers and
are

477
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:31,000
TV stations they need people that can
come in and talk about this stuff

478
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,030
and if you make yourself available they
will call you if you

479
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:37,110
send them a one-page tonight I have to
stress

480
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,250
in any this when you're trying to

481
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:45,559
contact the media send a one-page no
five-page diatribes

482
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:49,750
these people have 60 seconds to make a
decision and that call people

483
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,669
when it when it's convenient and if your
name's in front of them

484
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:56,980
as an expert on net neutrality or
whatever it is

485
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,669
they will call you also make sure you

486
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:03,960
you you know cut your hair and stuff
like that cuz

487
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,730
going on TV can look like too much of a
problem I

488
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,100
and also you know keep blogging but blog
fairly

489
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,970
com you know make sure you're
considering both sides

490
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,090
um some final thoughts on

491
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:23,300
becoming the media part of it is it's
more than just setting up a blog and

492
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,379
ranting about what's

493
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:27,540
interestingly you learn the rules of
journalism because when you when you

494
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,860
present both sides both sides in a
listen when you just present one side

495
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,450
one side to listen in your preaching to
the choir

496
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,290
and you know it use comedy on
uncomplicated

497
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:40,510
issues with a lot of the stuff that we
deal with

498
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,300
DMCA all these things very complicated I

499
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,530
using comedy in your writing

500
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:50,980
can set people at ease and

501
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,010
they'll listen I so

502
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:58,340
what I do now is I'm take a couple
questions

503
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:05,340
anybody's goddam in stark

504
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,990
well by arms I play Grand Theft Auto
four and I

505
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,450
think I noticed john Montone from 1010
wins thing we saw news

506
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,809
I like him a lot as any comment on his
involvement

507
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:20,740
at John Montone for the Super that art
from New York time on town is

508
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,290
the voice so far talk rar

509
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:28,590
news radio in this this town 1010 wins
does the you know news on the ones or

510
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,389
whatever

511
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:33,250
and it's always john montel running
around and

512
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:36,600
I'm always nervous about calling some of
these people insane hey you wanna be

513
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,860
photographed theft auto: cuz it hurts
like hell

514
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,070
know who you know I am just because
they've got some very much a skewed

515
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,408
perception of what Grand Theft Auto is

516
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:50,240
I think it the last the last game that
we did people started to realize that it

517
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,619
was very much

518
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:54,820
%ah an interactive our peace art

519
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,178
and and I an interactive world that that
does make a lot of comments on violence

520
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:01,929
in media and consumerism

521
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:07,139
John Montone I am when I call them and I
sorta explained it to him

522
00:32:07,139 --> 00:32:10,800
and what happens with a lot of these
people specially older

523
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,840
people distinguished people is they
asked their kids

524
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,220
and the kids got dude you gotta do it
you gotta do it

525
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,350
I am I there's a up

526
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,679
I've had a a lot of lot of people arm

527
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:28,710
have done that in Germantown was one I
was trying to think I

528
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,380
who the other one was and it comes to me
all right next one

529
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,779
on that the voice actor for Niko Bellic

530
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,840
hiya that the voice actor for an

531
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,130
Nico seems like he didn't know the
current about it was

532
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,809
big before a he did it search playing a
most Peter

533
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:49,860
the true to just I'm

534
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:54,200
yeah Michael Hollick who you know when
you work on these games they

535
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,950
they take like I worked on got the
better for for a over two and a half

536
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,179
years

537
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:02,360
I and some of my colleagues worked on it
for three-and-a-half

538
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,399
I'm them the main actor I

539
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:08,700
did an interview with The New York Times
and at

540
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,210
dinner a phenomenal interview and then
towards the end they asked him you know

541
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:17,240
how much are you getting paid in all
these kind of questions I

542
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,580
and he exhorted got sandbagged in the
article came out always not happy with

543
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,419
this pay

544
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,440
I which was not the case at all I Mikes
an awesome guy

545
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,200
and were still working with them so I

546
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,570
I think what you're about to see and
that article

547
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:36,710
is the first salvo there's gonna be some
really nasty

548
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,929
words set back and forth about

549
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,850
are payment unions

550
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,909
there's about this is possibly going to
be a huge a strike coming up in the next

551
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:48,870
month and at the end of the year

552
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,190
is the the video game contracts

553
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:55,240
go under consideration and

554
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,850
I have to say video games versus movies
it's really hard to break people out of

555
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,360
the movie mentality

556
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,090
I you know you get actors and agents and
stuff and and the like

557
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:09,409
well my guy came in and ended voice work
for two days

558
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,490
and it's on this huge game sekwalle okay
he did

559
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:16,250
voice work for two days but we've got a
crew

560
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,049
%uh artists doing rendering

561
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:25,909
and 3d art for a year to make all those
scenes and make that actor come to life

562
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:29,609
I gotta say that I'm not the one too
sorry for the actor

563
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:33,830
they did a lotta work but the people
behind the scenes people like you that

564
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,980
are sitting at computers

565
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,980
I am those are the people that are the
stars and a lot of video game thank you

566
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,010
you know in a lot of video game
companies realize that in hollywood just

567
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,340
cannot deal with this

568
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,140
its it some it was amazing when 2088 did
his thank God did as well as it did

569
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,589
you know all they could talk about was
gonna be tired man know it's not your

570
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:01,440
course it's gonna be Iron Man II

571
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,490
end it that all they care about is the
box office

572
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,590
and it's because there's this industry
in Hollywood

573
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,840
oMG that is so wrapped up around

574
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,600
the traditional model love movies the
pop Arazi as I spoke about before

575
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,670
I mean that is a multi-million dollar
industry TMZ Press Hilton

576

that model the helicopter in Grand Theft

579

effective weapons in this information

616
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,550
that Rockstar thought word

617
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,300

mean you know it

619
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:50,000
whatever sit around common writers my
writing partners dan Houser has won the

620
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,760
founders a rock star he's a genius

621
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,370
and Dom whenever you're writing a kinda
comedy Tom

622
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,400
stuff ever in for Playboy all over the
place

623
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,320
youth centre Ste says expressive ago the
coal writer

624
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,250
I the stuff that you say in private joke
around with if you publish that you'd be

625
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,180
in big trouble

626
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,390
I because you are just sort of sitting
around a joking so

627
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,450
I yet what are the things that we've
always done in our comedy

628
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,240
is go after the people that matter you
know don't make ethnic jokes to make

629
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,500
religious jokes

630
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,850
I mean that kinda stuff arm if if you're
leaning on that crotch she really doubt

631
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:30,080
now you really not making good comedy in

632
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:34,410
in my opinion are you said that I Clear
Channel's

633
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:38,020
use losing a lot of stations I was
wondering whether happening to them are

634
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,500
they

635
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:42,230
getting picked up by like local
organizations are they going darker or I

636
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,540
guess with the radio that they're not
going dark third

637
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:48,750
their arm selling of a I a few dozen a
time I think they're

638
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:54,300
Ste just sold I believe I like 300
stations I'm not sure but

639
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,710
I i believe they're going to smaller
smaller companies but

640
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,440
you know if those smaller conglomerates
unable to do anything with them then

641
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,900
they're gonna go back in the local
handsets just

642
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,640
that's just the way it's going to be an
eye I really hope they go back in a

643
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,450
local hands cuz I worked in radio

644
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,540
you know I i worked in radio when it
when most radio stations were

645
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,110
family-owned I mean CBS had eight or
twelve

646
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,710
oMG and you know some of the other big
broadcast companies like ABC had their

647
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,510
handful but there is a limit

648
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:28,140
there was a limit to how many you can
own so you know when you worked in radio

649
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:28,730
you

650
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,370
you hop from mom-and-pop operation a
mom-and-pop operation those people were

651
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,720
very passionate

652
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,870
about radio and now there's there's no
passion what's

653
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:42,380
what's happened in radio just to give
you kind of an inside look there used to

654
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,790
be a program director who made decisions
on content

655
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,250
that person is a relevant now the person
making the decisions decisions on

656
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,370
content is now the general manager

657
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:56,390
the general manager up got into radio
cuz he thought that he had talent and

658
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,950
then found out that he didn't

659
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:01,190
so we started sellin shit to use car
places

660
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,420
I those are the people that are making a
lot of the decisions

661
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:08,330
are in radio and i think is clear Chan
on some of these other companies

662
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,049
start to just sell these the stations of
they paid a fortune form

663
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:17,400
Clear Channel these like I i believe Q&A
for here went for like a 110

664
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,520
million dollars or something like that
and its

665
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,610
it's been losing money and its its it's
kinda funny cuz they spent a fortune on

666
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,730
all the stations

667
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:30,450
and then Satellite Radio on the iPod
came out sorry

668
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,550
thanks

669
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:39,360
I have two questions the first is what I
hope it as long as that other guy

670
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,520
what are your thoughts on the Sirius XM
merger

671
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,880
I N how long the FCC is taken to make a
ruling on it

672
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,040
and whether you're for or against that I

673
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,259
it's interesting that this merger is
taking for ever I'm against it

674
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:57,170
because when they when the FCC handed
out licenses for satellite radio

675
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,970
to these two companies they said here's
the deal we're giving you guys these

676
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,760
these licenses in the spectrum you
cannot merge

677
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,380
okay you have to stay separate and they
go okay thanks boss in the iran of

678
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,970
and they hemorrhaged money

679
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,250
they spent $500 million dollars for a
five-year deal for Howard Stern

680
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:21,750
Oprah gets paid something like sixty or
seventy million dollars

681
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,300
are for XM and she does like a half hour
show

682
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:28,530
and some of her friends do some kind of
other stuff

683
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:32,240
and then the real killer and one of the
reasons that your cable bill is so high

684
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,960
to some so there's a lot of sports fans
in the room

685
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,050
I am what are the reasons your cable
bill is so high

686
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:44,450
the that the biggest portion at that
goes to sports channels

687
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,490
I'm ESPN have all the cable channel's it
separates be on stuff like that they

688
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,250
charge the most money to cable provider
so all those cable channels where that

689
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,410
money's going

690
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:56,609
and XM and Sirius Satellite Radio

691
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,850
sign these deals and that they're broke

692
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,730
but you know I'm some sorry that you've
got a business but when my business

693
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,040
wasn't in tough times

694
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,630
they don't change the rules so that I
can stay in business but with XM and

695
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:13,040
Sirius it's like they're gonna change
the rules I think the mergers

696
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,120
horrible they're trying to gloss over 5
I'll give some stations to some

697
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,460
minorities in

698
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,910
you know what will open some more public
radio stuff but

699
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:25,620
it said they should stay separate and my
second question is can use any hits

700
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,810
in regards to the Grand Theft Auto
downloadable content release later this

701
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,509
year

702
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,860
I'm the downloadable content for a grand
theft auto 4

703
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,330
I I think it'll be out later this year I
don't I don't know what the release they

704
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,259
don't tell me the release states cuz I
get drunk

705
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,380
and battle I

706
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,630
so I really don't know what the release
date is on that

707
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,420
right it's got to come soon now I said
how

708
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,420
I need more missions to play

709
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,290
I'm I'm hoping you can come in over
share your thoughts on the monopoly

710
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:56,779
vividly

711
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,410
video game market and independent makers
and and serve analogous to the indie

712
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,160
music in

713
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,890
in the movie scene I'm said last month
that again

714
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,980
that the well there's this an
underground movement

715
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,810
a absurd in the music arm video game
makers

716
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:17,299
I'm so I'm curious about your thoughts
on empowering them verses

717
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,510
sticking with his monopoly companies
have UK market

718
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,780
yeah what are the biggest questions I am
asked as you know how do you get into

719
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,790
video games

720
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,950
I got into it by slacking off I was
hanging out on the beach a lot surfing

721
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,970
and %ah I met the one of the founders
the company and we sort it became

722
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,160
friends is like a company check this out

723
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,279
I and I could soon came to realize that
video game companies especially the

724
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,730
the developers it's basically a bunch of
guys that got some other friends

725
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,520
together and said hey

726
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,560
let's make a game I

727
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,540
and they they they work like crazy

728
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,650
packed a lot a code it's amazing
graphics

729
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,720
and before you know it somebody's
picking up that title

730
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,790
but is at Studio you can remain
independent

731
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:11,140
it's just that like a bigger company
like EA or Activision earned or take two

732
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:12,589
or somebody will publish

733
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:16,190
your work I guess that the main
challenge is getting it published and

734
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:16,980
getting picked up

735
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,470
and I guess that's what I'm really
wondering atop how to get published

736
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,250
well here's the Wow here's the arm

737
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,120
the tough part about getting published
if if you want to make a video game

738
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:33,160
don't make a a Playstation or an x-box
game make a PC game

739
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,640
because then you've got control in order
to make a Playstation or

740
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,319
x-box game you can't just make it
morally said you need explicit

741
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,030
permission from Microsoft or Sony

742
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:47,290
they have to go all through your code
they have to approve it before it's

743
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:49,060
released on their platform

744
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,130
so you'll see a lot of companies %uh
startup companies that are doing video

745
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,660
games that will

746
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,500
basically arm start on the PC platform
first

747
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,110
and self-publish I mean look at it
software

748
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,110
I'm and then eventually

749
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:09,860
you know you get you get picked up in
the fact of the matter is is that

750
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:13,170
1 you know if you create your own studio
you're not going to be able to you not

751
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,230
gonna have the capacity to the Met
manpower to port it to other platforms

752
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:20,380
at you know to to move that games x-box
a PlayStation

753
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:24,540
it cements you need dozens and dozens of
people working around the clock I mean

754
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,130
to get gta four on two platforms took
about four hundred people

755
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:32,400
cell thank you

756
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,520
with all with all the choice we have a
news media over now

757
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,100
now I know a lot of dissolution a really
nice low voice did

758
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,760
yeah welfare like nice radio voice I I'm
actually on

759
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,270
college radio are you yeah the RFL
Lexington

760
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,060
cooler anyway I am with all the choice
we have in media I know a lot of relief

761
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,310
disillusioned

762
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,890
journalism students who feel like the
truth being bitter

763
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,900
will never be able to compete with the
fluff because people can just

764
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:04,340
change the channel and ignore you know
the harsher realities

765
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,609
so what do you say to serve to europe
the the you know journalism students

766
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:14,509
I am it it is discouraging

767
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,410
because you now there's always going to
be people that were

768
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:22,920
the rat would rather vote in American
Idol then american democracy

769
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,079
right I unfortunately but

770
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,970
you know I think in a way you've got to
internalize it

771
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:34,930
you can't just make it about I'm gonna
go out there and change the world you

772
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,368
gotta make it about you

773
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:40,230
you've gotta make it about I'm gonna do
something for me I want to

774
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,819
you know cover the city council meeting
in expose the corruption

775
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:47,630
you know I want to go to the school
board meeting and Ike

776
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,240
expose this with that or make sure that
this is covered you gotta kinda do it

777
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,170
for yourself

778
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,680
first I think because if you keep
looking at everybody else out there you

779
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,520
are going to get discouraged because

780
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,130
I because celebrity vaginas

781
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,270
because people seem to be Eunos much
more interested in surfing TMZ

782
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:10,290
I then finding out what's going on in
full lucia

783
00:47:10,290 --> 00:47:13,440
but some I I commend you

784
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,559
if you know for the for the I'm not a
journalism student otherwise sock

785
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,960
I'm to the house but now I'm

786
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,170
I'd you know it's a it's a constant
internal battle it's easy to get

787
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:26,049
discouraged but you know you just got it

788
00:47:26,049 --> 00:47:29,500
you gotta keep blazin on and you know
one of the joys of writing for a

789
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:32,700
newspaper writing for a magazine is that
you're getting to write

790
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:37,290
and you're getting your stuff published
yet five minutes

791
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:41,319
but I think you are totally right that
humor can go a long way in making even

792
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:42,770
the most depressing stuff

793
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:46,690
you know palatable I it opens up
dialogue right next question

794
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:51,270
it's not a preface this by saying I know
you probably get asked about Jack

795
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,200
Thompson a lot

796
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,510
yeah but I was wondering dewey do you
actually feel he's like a thorn in your

797
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,640
side or do you think he kinda love

798
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,220
makes you look good by being so back she
crazy you know it it's hard and going

799
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,010
back to those

800
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:10,270
social media mouthpieces that always
seem to get called every time

801
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,970
something happens Jack thompson's on Fox
News

802
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:16,990
I am as the as the spokesperson

803
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:21,400
I am he's been a thorn in the side above
a lot of people

804
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,390
I in we did a game vice city stories on
the PSP

805
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:30,660
and I'm you know we had one other guy
some two Live Crew

806
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:34,000
came and did some voice stuff for us
those guys

807
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,359
really got railroaded by I mean if you
think that fit the video game industry's

808
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:39,509
been harassed by

809
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,770
by Jack Thompson two live crew and what
all that mess that happened in the

810
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:44,549
eighties

811
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:48,160
where records store owners were getting
arrested

812
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,950
for selling an album I you know

813
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:55,210
I think those people got got hard a lot
more but

814
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,319
I'm if you got it

815
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,529
game politics stock com you read up on

816
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:04,940
the situation with what's going on with
you process is being disbarred

817
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,960
yeah yep said

818
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,960
and I have to say that you know having
having a dialogue about

819
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:18,849
on video games the media music hip-hop

820
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:22,260
all that it's extremely important and I
think that you know there should be

821
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,819
panel discussions with parent group in

822
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:28,079
and the media and video game makers in
all that

823
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,270
what we what doesn't serve any of our
interests

824
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:37,069
is to have people and talking heads on
TV screaming that the world's ending

825
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:40,799
over pixels these people protest

826
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:45,910
pixels when there's real people getting
blown to bits

827
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:51,000
real Americans get blown to bits over
the ocean

828
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,250
it boggles my mind you know when I was
doing these interviews and people are

829
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:57,220
like what do you think about video game
violence my

830
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,280
not too worried about the per 10 stuff
dude kinda concerned about the real

831
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:08,280
stuff

832
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:15,380
alright

833
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,829
a wrap up quick as we've got to the key
no common and I wanna be a ramp am

834
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:24,069
okay so I guess it's fast

835
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:29,990
I'll come on okay so I guess is pretty
clear that you're

836
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:33,230
trying to create a generational
activists

837
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:36,990
with your video games are at least open
them up a little bit open their minds a

838
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:37,559
little bit

839
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:41,059
to what's going on in the world but I
was thinking for a long time

840
00:50:41,059 --> 00:50:45,690
what kind of skills are you secretly try
to teach people with these games

841
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,329
I mean actual skills in life whether
it's architecture

842
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:52,809
or even building demolition or

843
00:50:52,809 --> 00:50:56,490
how to you know that that's a skill that
you gotta really learn if you want to

844
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,690
get into that business but

845
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,779
I'm just curious what kinda skills You
Think You Can

846
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:06,029
kinda sneak in there .nom.co scientific
fraud triangle triangle square square

847
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:09,059
big one that's right skill I am

848
00:51:09,059 --> 00:51:12,539
I don't know you know it unnecessarily
trying to to

849
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:16,980
teach people skills I mean you could
kind of secretly

850
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,150
sneak that in there whether it's math or
science or

851
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,559
what the Beatles aming I think we do
sneak a lot

852
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:28,980
I in those games I'm mentor mean

853
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:33,150
rather than to force got over a hundred
radio commercial spoofs and at the just

854
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:37,240
you know why I believe skewer all kinds
of different products

855
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,619
I am and I don't really think we should
be looking at entertainment as

856
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:45,150
you know honing skills you know when
you're when you're watching The Sopranos

857
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,539
what skills are you

858
00:51:46,539 --> 00:51:50,309
hounding really what when you play GTA
four you learn how to drive better

859
00:51:50,309 --> 00:51:53,970
you learn how to drive better

860
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,849
exactly and had old ladies

861
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:02,509
alright I think we got time for one more

862
00:52:02,509 --> 00:52:09,240
um first as someone is 42 years old and
stop playing computer games after scare

863
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,119
but Rai

864
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:14,839
wanna say thank you very much for the
stock because it's opened up a whole new

865
00:52:14,839 --> 00:52:19,099
world for me I'm have you read the big
sort

866
00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:24,140
or do you know what the phenomenon is
now it basically talks about how

867
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,710
populations ourself selecting by
lifestyle moving in the neighborhoods

868
00:52:27,710 --> 00:52:29,400
where there are like-minded people

869
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,200
in when like-minded people come together
their reviews become

870
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,549
more strident workstream I am

871
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,730
and what i've seen is

872
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,359
while ownership media's consolidating

873
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,450
there so you're rising into nearer you
know they're

874
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:50,759
increasing their casting by media
increasing self-organized

875
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:55,650
to absolve selecting by audiences and it
becomes this or will burrows

876
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,559
this self sucking snake that doesn't
stop so

877
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:04,119
when you talk about trying to use humor
as a as a medium between these different

878
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:05,849
populations who think differently

879
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:10,519
what happens when people stop getting
each others jokes

880
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:15,319
I am and also I also wanna ask you what
do you think about the medics

881
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:19,049
about who medics means I whether I mean

882
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:22,549
the commercial people have always been
trying to manipulate means create means

883
00:53:22,549 --> 00:53:24,269
they often fall flat on their faces

884
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:27,990
is it is it up is it possible to do you
know

885
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:32,619
for on an from an avid advocacy
perspective I'm

886

887
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:40,538

892
00:53:53,509 --> 00:53:58,519
arm media conglomeration my buddy re
Tiger

893
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:01,700
I worked for Time Warner for a while are

894
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,730
the publication at the magazine they
publish just for their employees

895
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:10,039
which there's you now thousands I and he
told me that the mantra inside Time

896
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:10,750
Warner is

897
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,650
any of their divisions job is to push
all

898
00:54:14,650 --> 00:54:17,750
the products have the other divisions so

899
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:22,210
the magazines talk about and review the
books the time-warner publishes

900
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:25,450
I so you do sort of get this self

901
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,990
sucking snake where they're just kind of
like this introspective world

902
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:32,769
but what happens is when you started
getting that loop

903
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:38,000
the stuff starts to suck and you don't
realize it cuz it's your job to talk

904
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,160
about the other stuff that sucks

905
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,009
so I would encourage all of you to
create and to write

906
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:47,500
because that stuff will get online to
get passed around

907
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,710
because it's going to be a lot better
then what's out there thanks to

908
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:52,579
everybody for coming out of the in the
back
