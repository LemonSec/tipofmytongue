1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,810
a catalyst are most known as richer
Cheshire

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,919
and as one journalist put it it's not
his real name is not even israel's gonna

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,190
let's see if I can find my talk to do

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,830
Churcher medalists dot com slash

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,789
mobil oil though HTML are there it is

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,050
programming your mobile phone for
international calling

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,099
things you should know about your phone
are

8
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:33,180
submission talks which can be found at
this page if you printed out

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,730
you can you ve copy the pages well

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,129
well over and talk about the day are
simple

11
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:44,269
little mobile phones I don't like the
term

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,590
cellular phones so describe the
technology

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,890
and technology confuses most people
euros just call it mobile phones

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,910
that's all they are other the Telus

15
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,550
on that the towers have a cellular
pattern to them

16
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,660
the public really doesn't have a need to
know there's no need to confuse and

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,859
they're confused enough

18
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:07,619
already my other pet peeve is when
people

19
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,680
us they all call the 800 number no no

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,670
please get in the habit they are tall
free numbers they are

21
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,369
terry cloth 800 888 877

22
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:22,570
866 855 with more to come they are
toll-free

23
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,689
area codes up star correcting your
friends that usually

24
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:29,829
helps me to remember it myself the
numbers look as well

25
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:34,430
well let's start off with placing a
mobile phone call

26
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,650
overseas I'll the United States

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,880
12 we invented the phones so we're
number one

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,939
actually so is Canada and most European

29
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,549
a country code 1

30
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,880
is designated the North American
numbering plan

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,579
first laid out by the Bell System in the
nineteen forties for internal use

32
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:59,360
starting the fifties they started
releasing is the public under the trade

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:01:59,710
name

34
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,850
direct distance dialing well

35
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,960
what's the the International
Telecommunications Union

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,160
is really gotta go to arm find out about
such things

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,760
so they're running out to a website in
Geneva Switzerland

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,890
where we find recommendation

39
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,989
he 1.1 Stuy Town 164

40
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:26,489
now the International Telecommunications
Union is united nations specialized

41
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:27,110
agency

42
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:30,220
they speak to sovereign governments on

43
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,239
since telecommunications is run by
governments and most

44
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,050
I've world except the US a few other
places the thing is you cannot tell a

45
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,680
sovereign government what you can do

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,700
you can only make recommendations

47
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,099
course these recommendations pretty much
have the force of treaties

48
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:51,410
well if we follow our way through

49
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,140
are will find that eventually reach a
place

50
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,080
where there are PDF

51
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,110
table of contents and eventually you get
to a place where they want to charge you

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,940
for copies of the recommendations when
you're seven government not a problem

53
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,470
but looking for a list of the
International country codes

54
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:17,739
and up comes the page with a nice IQ
logo

55
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,599
to you

56
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,260
jus UGG here we go and its gonna cut it
when it works

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,560
26 Swiss francs to see that ch

58
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,580
the two other country code for
Switzerland F for frank's

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,690
so no we don't want that thank you very
much

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,379
so let's go to the PDF version you

61
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:45,790
so Wikipedia page for eat out 164

62
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,280
and all down the page it gives you all
sorts of information about the stuff

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,670
and the list of country calling codes

64
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,209
zone one being the North American
implant area

65
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:01,620
us to mostly Africa summer weather guy
wins 3&4 Europe

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,290
three is mostly Northern Europe for is
southern Europe pfeiffer Mexico Central

67
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,579
America South America

68
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,360
a french-american dependencies there's
one off the coast of Canada

69
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,110
that has a 52 Southeast Asia for zone 6

70
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:20,220
Russia and Kazakhstan for zone 7 East
Asian special services for age

71
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,470
West South and Central Asia the Middle
East was on nine

72
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,970
so you can all just visit Wikipedia

73
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,630
for that information muncie

74
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,540
control that he gets back now I don't
particularly care for PowerPoint so I

75
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,800
write my presentations in HTML

76
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,850
I'm what I can't do is that like my head
lice to

77
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,000
the next headline so now we speak about

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,430
country exit codes now

79
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,350
what they want to call a friend in Paris
well thats country code 33

80
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,280
one for Paris 555 2368 what's a

81
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,840
arm from the US i would tell the North
American

82
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,259
exit code 011

83
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:08,960
33 for France one for Paris 550 2368

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,560
let's say stop off in Heathrow on the
way over in london

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,800
their I knew to use 00

86
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,160
33 one 555 2368 because in the CP

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,350
our country's and that is the committee
for European posts and telegraphs

88
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:30,360
arm what telecommunications accuse me
I'm

89
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,400
I harken back to all them times arm

90
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,919
that's their website they're 00 is used
in europe and in most of the rest of the

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,340
world

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,860
well that's fine and dandy but I wanna
put one phone number

93
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,400
in my contact list in my mobile phone
for this but you might in Paris

94
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,840
the trick is to use the plus sign

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,300
in the nineteen seventies the IQ came up
with this as a method

96
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,600
for mentioning a our country's exit code
before a

97
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,410
country code and then the city code and
the number

98
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,490
and so you have business cards for
example like this

99
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,630
a plus one 311

100
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,610
Phi Phi 5236 a and all your phone for
his work knows that number as being the

101
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,139
number

102
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:20,860
on the number plate in Bell System ads

103
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,810
from say the nineteen thirties on are
the voices 5552 3689 area cuz came along

104
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,180
these

105
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,270
311 which is never been a record never
will be

106
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,630
et cetera are so

107
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,389
along come mobile phones in the nineteen
nineties so you know

108
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:41,460
we've got the site you standard that
says just for praying about business

109
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,180
cards

110
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,360
use a plus sign and since all of our
mobile telephone switches are

111
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,330
software-defined

112
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,370
what what we just use that same plus
side to be the

113
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,449
love the country Xoco he does reach up
to the network

114
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,569
are pulled down whatever country exit
code you need in that country

115
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:03,009
use that and put the number through

116
00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:07,699
it made sense they did anyway

117
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,490
so I what you can do is in the contact
list love your overseas correspondence

118
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,130
take out the 011 replace 011

119
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,719
with the plus sign character it will be
on your keyboard

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,270
either on the zero or on the one you may
have to hold down 20 to get the plus

121
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,139
sign

122
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,280
or I love some other will trick but it
will let you put a plus sign in there

123
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,030
for one thing your carrier was that
revenue for that overseas call

124
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,710
so I can make sure that their phones
have a plus sign in their

125
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,639
are the wireless carriers will tell you
to dial

126
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,819
the country exit cooked but not putting
your concept was

127
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:50,569
up for example let's just take a look at
how sprint so those things

128
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,789
I am naughty to put it into

129
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:59,460
the contact list how do I make an
international call

130
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,280
arm and let's see

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:11,280
that's control shift plus is a

132
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,210
when calling country country dial the
access code plus the country code

133
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,889
are common in the country blah blah blah
are

134
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:25,889
die over plus key to automatically or
dial that country's access code

135
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,149
to go they will tell you to dial the
plus key

136
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,440
the other countries well they called
access code CR

137
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,370
code exit the country's network plus the
country code plus the phone number

138
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:44,519
answers provided Nokia GSM phones first
post key twice into a plus sign appears

139
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,769
on your phone's display screen

140
00:08:46,769 --> 00:08:50,860
so tell you how to die out there with a
nap when you put it in your contact list

141
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,120
I'm the guy telling you put it in your
contact list

142
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,230
in no matter where in the world you are
if your phone works in the first place

143
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:05,350
it will put the call through

144
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,399
see the nice thing is I can just click
on the things in my HTML presentation

145
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,720
show you the different pages arm

146
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,000
no horizon again

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,820
as your four years ago talk about
Verizon back medicine as a direct

148
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,510
assistance after I can find my phone
book

149
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,399
they're going such good put 2011 plus 44

150
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,800
all that well over 13 years at local
number well

151
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,980
keep in mind the rise in has CDMA phones

152
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,529
so their phones won't work overseas most
places so they may as well just 30 2011

153
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,910
they do have a couple things they call
world phones

154
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,969
arm a major investor in Verizon Wireless

155
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,630
is an outfit called Vodafone and they
are very big

156
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,959
in Europe in the sewer markets so

157
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,959
they have special arrangements if you're
going overseas to use Vodafone service

158
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,630
Vodafone is in many places around the
world the

159
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,260
arm there primarily in Europe so I
understand it

160
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,370
and other you have a presence here
through Verizon

161
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:21,370
and group wrong button hang on

162
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:28,850
no I don't want that now thank you very
much

163
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:34,000
phones you know back on the road again

164
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,000
so extras

165
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,150
okay so as seen on the phone body mine
actually met you are

166
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,240
went to China and got the manufacture to
make

167
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,150
the hope badges he was in China about
his TV B Gone

168
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:03,840
work with them on our badges as well are
the RFID badges

169
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,900
so while he was there since his on
mobile number I'll hit send to mobile

170
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,140
number of his Chinese cell phone when
he'd rented over there r2r

171
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,840
our list i text message m and ask that
you please send me

172
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,890
all the digits as they show up above my
phone number

173
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,960
and he told me that my phone never came
back 001

174
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,350
321 my four day recur plus the rest my
phone number

175
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,610
00 being the exit code from China

176
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,860
going to a North American 10

177
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,980
was remembered plan was American number
and then my number

178
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,290
when he responded to me are

179
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:45,140
in my caller ID this text message came
from

180
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:51,110
011 which I'll was the exit code for me
if I wanted to reply to him

181
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:55,440
86 for China plus the digits of his
phone number

182
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,640
so again the PLO signed should be used

183
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,030
because up that way the phone call

184
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:06,689
or the text message will go through no
matter where it's placed

185
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,450
in the world are here's my rant about

186
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,550
never calling it an eight hundred-number
because of all the various

187
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,620
toll-free area codes that are available
and

188
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,260
are dial the exit code followed by the
country could remember as you would from

189
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,330
on an international call from that
country by the way back up here

190
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,330
I had an example love a British phone
number we're gonna have that now

191
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,340
arm here plus 44 for the UK

192
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,610
but on UK business cards what you'll
find

193
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,690
is they have a zero in parentheses

194
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,110
and this is part of the eye view
specifications well

195
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,790
arm a number for the national service

196
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,890
love your nation's phone network if
you're in the UK you don't need the 44

197
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,960
country code of course

198
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,010
but you do need 0 in front of the number
to access

199
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,330
are what was then an STD standard drunk
dialing

200
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,760
I think with the controversies have
sexually transmitted disease are not

201
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,630
using that particular

202
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,750
acronym anymore but arm

203
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,560
before the standard truck dialing is it
was called at one time you need those

204
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,210
euro before the City Code

205
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,670
778 in this case and and the residue
number

206
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,040
so this year was used in the national
service

207
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,219
today you could probably get away with
just having the PLO's 44

208
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,440
778 14 you know

209
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,480
and the number in your contact was
without

210
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,760
08 they have it work within England I do
not know anybody I can has to try that

211
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,280
for me

212
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,439
so I can't be certain that but are I
would

213
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,910
there's a that the its our sewer
networks over there

214
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,390
are cognizant love how to set things up
for international dialing will others

215
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:49,930
through

216
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,080
0

217
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,600
see arm

218
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,250
just other stuff I spent a year as

219
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:06,120
a technician for prize where was done in
Florida and/or

220
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,190
one thing you like to recommend people
was it is not a good idea to talk to

221
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,030
your mobile phone

222
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,360
why what's plugged in just for battery
charging reasons

223
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,120
are if you should you should it was only
for better solo you feel the call

224
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,930
because of

225
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,060
on most other powers provided the reason
being

226
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,610
the lithium-ion batteries in the mobile
phones

227
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,890
are have a limited number charges to
them

228
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:32,949
so your jacket in you have a full charge
when I talk on the phone

229
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,750
while you're talking the charred
overcomes below a threshold

230
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,120
but says 0 well I start charging the
phone now and there goes another above

231
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,920
those funded number charges gone away

232
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,760
I reaches the top lawyers still talking
so it stops charging

233
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,100
and you're still talking in you know
using up some battery

234
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,580
if you miss later the threat against oh
I guess I could start charging again now

235
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,900
and there goes another one of those find
it never a charge is gone away

236
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,510
so you should I unplug the phone when
you're talking on it

237
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,660
on what's the charges solo you'd be cut
off

238
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,709
I like to use Bluetooth headsets

239
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,740
I've lost mine this weekend serves a

240
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,230
but arm Bluetooth headsets

241
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,560
use low power to go from your year

242
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,800
to your phone which is within 30 feet a
view Bluetooth

243
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,610
on the works of range about 30 feet and

244
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,790
um using your it's a lot closer to you
than that

245
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,099
usually holding if or it's in your
pocket or whatever else

246
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,800
it doesn't take that much power to get
there compared to the amount of power

247
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,260
going from the phone

248
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,410
to the nearby towers

249
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,500
I don't know about you I'm a little ham
radio operator I like having that much

250
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,530
transmitting power that close to my head

251
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:51,670
so I much prefer Bluetooth headsets to
having the phone at my head

252
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:56,220
in fact what actually this is its it's a
long story what got you fun but usually

253
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,780
it will do that I'll put it on speaker
phone

254
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,730
with looks bigger on the other side up
the handset and I'll talk this way

255
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:07,890
because I can still hear program the
whole the phone is close to my head

256
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,010
when I don't have the headset had

257
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,050
are any questions

258
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:20,560
its yes

259
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,829
up my web address here is a Cheshire

260
00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:26,319
catalyst dot com chce

261
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,529
SH Irie cata

262
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:34,339
lyst dot com and the pages slash

263
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:39,180
mobile dot HTML and

264
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,939
I'm now let's see we can probably not
this back a bit to just bring up home

265
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:44,550
page

266
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:48,879
and making sure the surface since 1975

267
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:52,339
now I have a friend we refer to as

268
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,420
subtlety impaired is now the term I use
is because the FBI know that you are

269
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,110
agencies

270
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,339
but he didn't notice till the server
wasn't couldn't figure it out just

271
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:04,520
hearing it a soldier server some who
watches you over your shoulder

272
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,668
as you surf the ARPANET crossed out
internet

273
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,280
I just had throwing I'm so old school
though

274
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,270
you know did have the ARPANET way back
when on

275
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,730
and then somebody asked me about ok a
question about my leadership position in

276
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,059
the

277
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,250
computer hacker community so I came up
with this I am NOT a leader

278
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:31,169
I'm a loner with people who happen to
follow me nobody in mind have a pipe up

279
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:35,100
and certainly this John Quincy Adams
quote if your actions by others to dream

280
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,120
more learn more do more and become more
you are a leader

281
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,799
well 22 is more by accident than design
in my case

282
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,070
I'm also

283
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,289
I needed some help to get here and

284
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:52,379

and the few that have not been sold on
eBay are now available

294
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,770

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,679
see me after the talk are any further
questions

308
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,679
general yes

309
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,430
the question being about the overall
theme ion batteries and how many charges

310
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,390
do they really have

311
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,680
are generally it's got about a year's
worth

312
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,440
others pose less about a year to year
and a half and if you can go two days

313
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,650
between charges as your last that much
longer

314
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:08,650
so now that I've been able to figure out
no

315
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,540
and while working at Verizon I know some
people coming back

316
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,220
with batteries from brand new phones
within a month and

317
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,290
I suspect may have just been a bad
better batteries out a career

318
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,950
you're mostly all Samsung phones so if
you do have a major problem with a

319
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,750
battery

320
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,290
uptake Apeksha carrier and and complain

321
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:32,960
and you know the technician does it easy
on you may just what yet battery

322
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,420
to rise and we had a times field was six
months old we give it was of a new

323
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,390
battery

324
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,470
you know so on so forth but that was
pretty much up to the discretion of the

325
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,030
technician

326
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,110
yes

327
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,320
would

328
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,450
I don't believe in a personal question
no

329
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,120
else

330
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,410
okay well got some extra time

331
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,010

that it's a great tool if used well

372
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,210

398
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,510
sponsors

399
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,830
and ask our because it's all over it has
been really

400
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:54,220
my interest is in the cars go fast in
turn left my interest is in the

401
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,860
advertising arm

402
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,510
there's an all fashions concert called
the use map

403
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:06,190
where I can click on something here and
this will go to the snap on website

404
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:10,510
I can click here to go to the GM card
website

405
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,600
and that seems fairly obvious

406
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,840
I kind with the Easter eggs with you
click on Jeff Burton signature appeared

407
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,429
go to Jeff Burton dot com

408
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:24,629
unfortunately his needs flash so

409
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:28,080
I like to say that they're saying get
flasher get gone

410
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,789
and I guess I didn't have the right
version of Flash

411
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:35,419
since arm didn't come up

412
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,620
yeah he doesn't have flash

413
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,510
so I MUST HAVE not have the right
version

414
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,289
own Fairfax prevent the sofa bring a
pop-up window so they do not countenance

415
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:47,690

422
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,510

control all-state

427
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,720
you'll see I've got the races for the
rest of the year actually

428
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,090
in this file but

429
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:47,090
remarked out my regular cell phone as my
Treo 650 about the SIM card the other

430
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:48,929

432
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,399

the trio also has is an FTP program file
transfer protocol

435
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:04,470
i can download the webpage at around the
phone

436
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,230
and send it back up course love

437
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,809
I can't always get to it in time I would
like to you

438
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,928
was what I like to do is

439
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:20,970
up actually change the finish position
at the Cup points and add up

440
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,059
the the series total for the year

441
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,658
be four jaise ki sent me the text
message with the results

442
00:28:28,659 --> 00:28:32,970
and have it up on the net while sitting
at my local bar watching the race

443
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,299
who also knows a little dots down here

444
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,570
the first up is where the entry list
will be

445
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,369
if you look up its are entry underscore
with Doug HTML

446
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:49,669
if I actually not this back from slash
twenty to slash

447
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,470
19 for the 19th race last phrase

448
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,090
that's popular with the entry was for
the last race

449
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,399
and if we want to we can go to

450
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:07,210
lineup there was the lineup for the last
phrase

451
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,260
these are all drive just changes the
race number

452
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,658
so anyone who wants to do i hack around
on my webpage

453
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:18,760
will find that these dots go to these
other pages if I haven't gotten around

454
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:19,440
to

455
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,580
updating the page they want the
information they can click on the docks

456
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,779
and do that

457
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,210
I was there for hackers to find

458
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,669
I just cuz you know if I'm too lazy to
get the information that has to be able

459
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:35,289
find the information

460
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:39,179
so you'll have to forgive me and simply
ego tripping here

461
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:46,179
and I thank you for your patience your
question yes

462
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,290
since I have not travelled overseas in

463
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:01,889
more than a decade no I have not done
the research on No

464
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,440
putting other countries and cons SIM
cards into my phones

465
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,190
what research I have done is just
swapping swell SIM cards

466
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,940
in my phone and mine isn't unlocked Treo
650

467
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,460
so I have put T Mobile cards into work
and they've worked

468
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,490
here in the States I my love what's what
between to AT&T phones

469
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:26,110
and so now you know the winds are swabs
are so I could %um

470
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:29,470
where do you do heavy-duty data on the
other guys line

471
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,830
I can do it and that's what the SIM
cards back and beyond

472
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:36,210
on my line again I am right now I'm I'm

473
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:40,560
on Twitter from you adjust for the
weekend cuz -ism hope people on Twitter

474
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,700
and so I wanna buy Twitter a change
which phone number

475
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:47,140
it was going to do so is back on the
phone with QWERTY keyboard again

476
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,270
and I'll go back change the phone number
there

477
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:53,510
that's what the SIM cards and I'm back
on still the same funds

478
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,060
will be keeping track of things but
other funds if it's not unlocked phone

479
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,870
particularly

480
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:02,320
it will accept other SIM card so I
assume it would accept them

481
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,770
for overseas use as well I haven't seen
any

482
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,940
I don't know political problems but I
have a travel and I haven't I would look

483
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,560
into it

484
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,179
are living in the Cape Canaveral area

485
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:19,160
Port Canaveral is a major cruise ship
port

486
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,180
we have a little cyber cafe

487
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:26,270
on the side of the local mall where the
little just the buses

488
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,670
poll up with the cruise who are off duty
from those ships

489
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,280
it's their cyber cafe to go in they buy
a phone card

490
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,790
I think we also buy SIM cards in there
and you know the place calls all over

491
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:41,159
the world got phones all over the place

492
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,740
for people with this phone home and for
those who have cell phones that they

493
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,530
want to use

494
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,879
%uh they do sell SIM cards as well so

495
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,970

522
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,650
problem okay so we're going to have a
listener come across 321

523
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,490
wine is that strike a familiar all of
course countdowns

524
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,720

526
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:48,890
time to bring down the web browser time
to bring up the word processor

527
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,350
and begin preparing my testimony for the
Public Service Commission hearing was

528
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,880
held in the Orlando City Hall

529
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,430
in the city council chambers I was

530
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,980
dear shiftless I meet it was too obvious

531
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,770
well it was too I've used it somebody
who was both the phone freak and a space

532
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,389
cadet

533
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,440
it was not obvious that anybody else in
the room until

534
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,040
I got up to preserve my testimony I want
I pointed it out

535
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,949
there was instantly obvious the one
Sherman although

536
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:23,359
the one commission members that you know
we like to have this kind of sugar

537
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,919
coating

538
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,389
to put on the bad news the people or get
that they have to change your area code

539
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:32,129
this is a great idea and the really
interesting thing

540
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:36,030
was that the chairman of the Commission
came up to me

541
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,360
after the meetings which is that you
know sir

542
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,419
we went in and good and we requested
such a list as you provide in your

543
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:45,199
testimony

544
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,630
that you got off the internet and they
told us it was proprietary

545
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:53,070
I want to thank you very much for your
testimony

546
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,230
and you know what mere personal
conjecture

547
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,160
I think she went back to name for I
think you read the manual I'm

548
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:08,160
I got as the area code thank you

549
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,859

they pick that up nationally and

555
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,840
pet starts off the day by saying it's
official

556
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,020
the next area code will be the last 32
just a dash notes here when the

557
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,200
yes okay I got it it's mine what I asked
for it they approved it

558
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,440
exit my area code right but I share

559
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,250
