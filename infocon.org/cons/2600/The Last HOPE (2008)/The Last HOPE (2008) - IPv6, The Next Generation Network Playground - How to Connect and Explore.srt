1
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:32,210
right

2
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,480
with different camera

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,519
she

4
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,520
three

5
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,590
you

6
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,799
good evening it's nine o'clock

7
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:33,420
this isn't the bar when you guys doing
here I

8
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,189
my name's Joe Klein and

9
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,990
name is talk is ipv6 next generation
network playground yes how to connect to

10
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,000
explore the network

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,280
can I see well let's see I have to step
aside

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,670
hands on people that are running ipv6
today

13
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:55,090
now now everybody else put their hand up
because there's a good chance

14
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,219
ipv6 is under network by the end is
presentation

15
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,880
weird talk about all the systems that
are potentially vulnerable

16
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,330
I'll let me do the standard disclosure
yes I'm responsible for his presentation

17
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,590
on with the job know my customers

18
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,980
not to go for another laptop number dawg
I don't have a dog that you know

19
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,480
will get over that um been researching
this for about five years this is the

20
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,010
first time I've gone to

21
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,048
conference really talked about someone
might discoveries summer the

22
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:26,829
the viability towards the N word to
discuss I

23
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:30,239
has been around for two years we've been
a

24
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,209
friends mine are trying to get to
certain people to fix these problems it

25
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,850
takes a while until the wee

26
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,209
tell them hey guess what wanna talk
about this in a hacker conference

27
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:44,769
so they are suddenly decide to move our
talk belt

28
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,160
a background um when ipv6 some

29
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,530
how did we get to the mess that we're in
right now and we'll talk about them SS

30
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,620
we'll talk about the features like PB
six are gonna provide

31
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,109
a lot of this specially in the security
field on

32
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:04,260
a lot of features a will be able to use
in control on and also some privacy

33
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,660
issues which is pretty cool

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,609
um how to connect you know what is this
what is the three-step so we need to do

35
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,150
to connect this system a network
whatever up to the internet

36
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,989
and lastly some testing we performed and
if we have the time will show the demo

37
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:19,810
the vulnerability

38
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,959
okay um

39
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,160
the Internet ipv4

40
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,310
internet really started are with

41
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,440
NCP back in the sixties it was concept
that

42
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,829
duty was tired of paying she prices
shipping scientists back in four so that

43
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,430
one scientist could actually

44
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,549
view the records in programs another
scientist sell it East Coast scientists

45
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:48,890
would have to see something

46
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,310
and they have to fly the West Coast
actually run the application

47
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,430
so they came up with the concept you
there we go the concept of NCP

48
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,099
unfortunately had limited address space
256 device is kinda small rate

49
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,579
um really was based on

50
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,860
allow the concepts from sixties um

51
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,110
currently i pp 4 is based on a lot

52
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,209
I love computing environment ideas many
computers mainframes from 70's

53
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:20,899
are operating systems that ipv4 based on
is

54
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,820
early version CBS steal annexing I V
units

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,050
applications network's programming
languages and we've gone longer

56
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,159
operational experience and we'll head
its

57
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:34,330
the especially in security and the
operational side

58
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:39,159
and a in the 90's and 2000's the results
are

59
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:43,860
that ipv4 is suffering from a success or
to talk about what those

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,080
with that suffering really is um we're
also talk about why ipv6 is ready to go

61
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,580
today

62
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,620
and cake current problem

63
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,919
ipv4 was designed with the capability

64
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,400
up providing and Inc an activity so if I
had an application 512 telnet into a

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,169
system FIS

66
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,530
authorize the talents that system I B
love telnet into the system

67
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:11,940
felt all the crazy nets in all the other
complexity and half devil

68
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,710
lots of code to actually perform that
activity arm

69
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,599
today we had this real inability to make
that connection anymore

70
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,620
arm the reason is that

71
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,090
back in nineteen ninety there was a
perception that we're running out of

72
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:26,950
address is

73
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:32,800
I ATF announced publicly 1990 running
out of IP addresses yes this is Ben

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,169
on around a long time so

75
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,780
after about four years a determined hey
we need to do something about this

76
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,560
the up and decided to put some stop-gap
measures in place

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,810
so that we could exist and

78
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,459
IP be forceful as long as we could but
give time for ipv6 to be generator this

79
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,940
new technology at the time it was

80
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,020
I PNG at the time Star Trek next
generation was hot can you

81
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,380
you know next-generation I P you okay
very free

82
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:11,620
gates on so we ended up with a lot of
work arounds we establish gateways

83
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,589
again and CPE we had established gateway
city next week rate

84
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,649
me four so we didn't have to stab was
gay ways we start a star running out of

85
00:06:19,649 --> 00:06:22,849
address space now we have to create more
gateways

86
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,570
on these gateways for using NAT and PAT
network address translation nom port

87
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,860
address translation

88
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,709
with an atty establish the 1918 space
because people were trying to

89
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:36,830
suddenly applied say berkeley um

90
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,500
IP addresses internal to large
corporations anybody working the

91
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
early mid nineties ran into this on a
regular basis for some bud second you to

92
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,550
this website or i can get a well your
whole

93
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,580
domain is based on 18 tease and

94
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,830
you can't route internally to AT&T

95
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,890
on we also saw a lot of mapping I love
standard ports port 80

96
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,969
suddenly became 4081 4082 Ford

97
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:07,159
794 whatever their programmers had to
deal with because we only had

98
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,149
one address for 21 address for small
amount dresses

99
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:15,159
for small mouse service we also had
multiple address

100
00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:18,440
our ranges we have today most
organizations

101
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,979
on how to address ranges from maybe two
three four maybe a dozen

102
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,830
maybe 100 maybe in certain organizations
thousand

103
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,300
address ranges and mapping all that

104
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,930
through the firewall so that we have
connectivity

105
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,419
it's very error prone so with no
problems there

106
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,060
to the real workarounds have resulted
and nested now

107
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,849
there are cases in India that NAT

108
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,849
is six to seven levels deep

109
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:52,330
can you imagine programming in at
scenario

110
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,260
Voice over IP mmm real good application
that point

111
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,620
one broken applications are those of us
that had to

112
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,890
run on oh well fileshare cross NAT

113
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:06,399
I broke the protocols the Microsoft had
me

114
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,820
changes make even more complex we
establish on

115
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,209
in the the around 2,000 the program
community said

116
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:19,149
heck this net stuff is just a pain to
our application so let's create some

117
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:20,969
workarounds for this so

118
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,750
the programming community %uh supported
by a well Microsoft

119
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,349
fun people like that they create the
technologies like stunned and turn

120
00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,519
ice so today what we have is we have fun

121
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,539
a lot about cations that we have in our
internal networks

122
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,598
all have these additional libraries
these additional

123
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,610
code libraries we also have to have
these in our firewalls morale or so we

124
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,490
basically

125
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,080
are getting to a code bloat scenario in
love our situations

126
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,350
and some my coat really wasn't fully

127
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,800
tested in the past and anyway

128
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,490
we end up with more gateways real
complex infrastructure security

129
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,860
um if you were an organization that has
safe for Internet connections

130
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,519
three or four DMC's a dozen extra nets
to customers

131
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,350
mapping that is a total headache and
ensuring from

132
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,390
auditing standpoint from assessments and
point

133
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,010
from penetration test %uh stay in points
for easy cuz you know they're gonna make

134
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:21,740
stake in it

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,880
is so complex on

136
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,290
it takes a lot of time effort and you
really have the inability to

137
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,410
identified vices on the networks anybody
performed the

138
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:36,750
assessment and all the sudden realized
he does this whole nother networks

139
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,980
hiding behind a snack box that somebody
decided to put up

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,000
any they run in that scenario know I
have many times

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,600
the it's a really ipv6 is %uh focused on

142
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,810
removing those gateways again so we can
see in touch those devices

143
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,209
I reduce the application for callin
security complexity so we can start

144
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,890
you know down that path we have simpler
code

145
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,080
more secure code and also reestablish
the end and connectivity so we don't

146
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,090
have to have specialized Voice over IP
gateways to be able to

147
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:16,400
jumped 45 net environments

148
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,280
the justification who there we go
justification the second justification

149
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,100
we have a lot of devices how many have
you have

150
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,370
more than one phone with you

151
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,640
any computer its three addresses how
many you have

152
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,910
well like I do TV shows and

153
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,530
apples and our own lil networks into
firewalls and all the other things at

154
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,510
home

155
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,310
um companies like the cable companies
Comcast

156
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,250
rice and fires there now realizing that
their customers really need anywhere

157
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,290
from $10 to $20 to $50

158
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,670
addresses within their address space
their home address space

159
00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:00,150
and right now they're all behind NAT so
it it causes a lot of complexity

160
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,140
we also have fun X pots I guess
everybody has an x-box

161
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,090
it has an address also so we have a lot
of fun

162
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,870
IP addresses um we don't even have a
list the sensors we see a lot of fun

163
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,540
ipv6 answers for temperature in cameras
and things like that now being deployed

164
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,730
so this point we have fun

165
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,770
%uh by 2012 were expecting about

166
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:27,170
$2.16 billion devices

167
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,430
unique devices on the net that's before
times

168
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,680
bigger than the current Internet I mean
that's that as a lie complexity I'm not

169
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,600
sure if you guys wanna map all those
netted firewalls around them

170
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,420
kinda crazy on we also have an address
exhaustion to be at a

171
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,310
reach out and touch those are specific
devices

172
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,300
people have to have those addresses so
if the organization year with

173
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,850
has to suddenly implement a new network

174
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,330
or maybe integrate two additional
networks they have a new idea

175
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,150
getting access to address face is
getting harder and harder

176
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,660
and because it's getting harder and
harder to require more complex fire all

177
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,339
setups

178
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,700
routing set-ups he it's making a it a
real mass

179
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,410
also a lot over countries that were only
allocated just a few addresses

180
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,709
have moved ipv6 today some others
customers summers people were customers

181
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,220
love sunnier companies and organizations

182
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,380
um so what we have is

183
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,400
basically people with ipv6 addresses
trying to communicate with ipv4 which

184
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,800
doesn't work a lot of organizations the

185
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,760
really don't won't even know their
customer base is dropping off until

186
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,470
their help desk

187
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,080
start increasing people are saying look
I'm trying to get to you via v6 and i

188
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,140
cant

189
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,580
but Musser customers wouldn't say that
what they they would say can get your

190
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,680
website drive your help those people
crazy

191
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,720
on so we're were basically at a point
right now

192
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,970
that lot organizations need to put in
outside facing ipv6 infrastructure in

193
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,890
place

194
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,910
unfortunately as we go into the
vulnerabilities we've

195
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,150
the that we've done research on are you
know scissors lot business apathy to now

196
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,170
serves yes

197
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,220
that's a new buzzword I'm trying to
implement across the community

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:24,279
that's where businesses decide not to
take action dislike we had with wireless

199
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,250
access points where security really is
implemented until we start seeing bad

200
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,080
things

201
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,610
we don't wanna see bad things this time
and

202
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,839
yes you are here and yes you might be
here

203
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,610
if you don't know if you notice that's
the ipv4 network diagram

204
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:46,180
I with the ipv6 network ten years later
yes the ipv6 network does exist out

205
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,510
there

206
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:51,439
their own lot of notes it is currently
routing matter fact I attempted to get

207
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,010
us on the ipv6 network here

208
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,060
at this summer conference so people
would start playing with it

209
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,900
at this time on it's a pretty big
networks

210
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,270
on as we see depletion are the dresses
were expecting the address

211
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:14,270
the the ipv6 to look more like the ipv4
within the next five to eight years

212
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:18,700
get so let's review some other features
a by PV six if you

213
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,380
haven't seen a ipv4 verses ipv6 address

214
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,189
yes it's a lot longer yes you will learn
how to type

215
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,900
lot more accurately but if you notice
the grade on the road

216
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,740
not have katha nation its the clock arm

217
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,100
also the capability doing stateless the
autoconfiguration

218
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,839
a the ability to make one line
configuration your router

219
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,890
and support thousands assistance behind
it

220
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,420
minimal change minimal configuration the
ability to actually see multi cast

221
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,720
implemented single data stream that can
nom have multiple drops

222
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,560
so we can finely you know reduce the van
with going out

223
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,740
extension headers and mobility extension
her so we can add new features without

224
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,510
being forced to say

225
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,569
may be coming up with a ninety seven or
eight or nine

226
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:09,649
on policemen our lifetime I

227
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:15,110
ipv6 the mobility it can be done with
ipv4 and that is that

228
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,560
a specific node in have an address that
follows them

229
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,950
so things connections don't get dropped
as a

230
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,140
run across the network right now it's
been attempted with I can be foreigners

231
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,100
just landed

232
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,610
nothing dress spaces to deal with say
all the cell towers in the United States

233
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,020
very difficult problem I another really
neat thing is the jumble grammy keep

234
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,939
believe having pit packets that are

235
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,230
6k but that's that's going to make God

236
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,750
data transfers lot of other things very
very effective

237
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,770
simplify the routing because now all the
packets are on 64-bit

238
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:56,579
I alignment so we're really reducing the
processing our routers have to go

239
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,720
through by reducing l3

240
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,779
I'll check some QS the QS

241
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,490
is the provides a lot more granularity

242
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,170
we have both a traffic class and flow
class

243
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,020
so the application consists can actually
say hey I need this kind capability and

244
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,699
the routing infrastructure can say this
is all I can provide you are this 1i can

245
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,760
provide

246
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,300
and beer provide some custom routing on
in addition

247
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,580
privacy addressing today

248
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:31,680
if we can act al were directly connected
to the Internet we have a

249
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,210
global you round ball dress that address
is pretty much a sign to us

250
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,279
doing that connection time so if we
bring up a browser somebody tries to

251
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,140
connect to assist the same

252
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,250
capability privacy dress has the ability
to provide you a temporary

253
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,820
random address and in some cases

254
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,089
you can browse for five minutes and you
get another dress for the next grouse

255
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:58,660
makes a nice

256
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,980
let's talk about the address is we have
the left side in the right side not to

257
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,250
be confused with the political situation

258
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,599
um the left side I was really

259
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,909
allocate by Aaron currently the 18

260
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:14,760
spaces what's been allocated with a lot
more space to go

261
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,720
I anna has some

262
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,850
issued block so that 285 regionals
round-the-world

263
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:28,699
we then have the ISP's which are
assigned us last 32 as you can see from

264
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,830
the rare that's a lot of address space

265
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,939
um insights

266
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,690
can be allocated a slash 48 which is
equivalent to

267
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,809
be your slash

268
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:45,330
whatever I 16

269
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:49,019
an ipv4 so we you can

270
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:52,519
pretty much end up with enough space
small companies in

271
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,470
home users themselves end up with two
hundred fifty four networks at home

272
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,059
would have been need um

273
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:04,070
again notice everything is the and
64-bit boundary

274
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,950
everything to the right by the way is
locally sign

275
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,649
red talk about the right side on

276
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:15,630
on this segment itself are the local
host assignment

277
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:21,120
even for single ipv6 address that's
enough posts I think

278
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,919
I could get away with for a little while
within my house

279
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:32,090
okay arm we also have if the system
itself a sign if itself assigns an

280
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,860
address

281
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,260
we also I am have the vendor id:

282
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,620
associate in the on address that could
be very handy from a

283
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,570
assessment same point maybe are we have
an effort that he's

284
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,168
on so that we can see that is a self
assigned address now we have a

285
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,909
vendor or alignment or defender Simon by
the way

286
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:58,330
arm just like an ipv4 we have different
ways we can allocate addresses we can

287
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:01,580
hard coating that stole a pain in very
difficult to manage

288
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,580
we have a stateless autoconfiguration
where it creates addresses like this

289
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,830
and we have the state full address is
using

290
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,000
dhcpv6 so its its

291
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,309
not much difference except we get one
more option in fast

292
00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:23,269
implemented networks are which is this
tale so to convict here's with blocks

293
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:23,899
look like

294
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:27,250
yes not to scale so Stanback

295
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:33,100
um v4 dress let's be serious ago sry
2060 bytes

296
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,990
it she changes

297
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,580
again everything is a online mint scales
right there

298
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,590
on 64 bit Lima skills argue knows a lot
of the

299
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,500
up components have been dropped out so
it makes it simpler

300
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,110
and again arm if our l2 is doing

301
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,320
RCR C&L for is doing

302
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,379
some kind of check some we really don't
need ipv6 doing checks also

303
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:06,169
one the other features it has the
ability have extension headers as

304
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:10,559
wow this gives us ability create linked
lists within the pact has some cells

305
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,539
and create custom configurations %uh so
in this case we have an IP be

306
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:20,059
6 header the header itself says hey

307
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:24,200
here's a ti the next packet following is
going to be a TCP header and the day

308
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,590
with a TCP header

309
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,658
call arm for the routing header

310
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,700
where we're doing nom source routing we
would

311
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,299
have it the second one the third one
might be

312
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:39,879
the a fragmentation I mention something
about fragmentation

313
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:44,070
unlike NV 4 were fragmentation is done

314
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,049
Dom one path to inflate I

315
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,870
v6 the fragmentation is actually
performed on the host and

316
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,440
on the transmission it makes a decision
based on

317
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,330
ICMP packets that it communicates with
an unfortunate on

318
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,699
time to go through a lot other fun stuff
extension headers

319
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,029
hear somebody extension headers yes you
see I P sec

320
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:12,799
arm authentication encryption H and He
espy's for the fragmentation rally

321
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,179
and yes others exist and others can be
defined

322
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,619
so if there's a specific need within the
industry to crate a

323
00:21:20,619 --> 00:21:26,740
specific type from header it's available

324
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,750
K so now we know the basics so we know
that

325
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,700
the for is running out we have these
problems is figure out how to get

326
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,869
ourselves configure

327
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:38,899
well the first thing is let's make sure
devices

328
00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:43,159
whether it's your home or your business
or

329
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,529
as large as you want to go and we have
determined that our posts around our

330
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,389
skin support ipv6 wanna show you some
some systems

331
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:54,399
will check to see if ipv6 is already
enabled on the system's

332
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:59,320
very simple process and we discuss how
to connect to the ipv4

333
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,090
excuse me the ipv6 internet through
three different methods

334
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:11,939
gay so does anybody haven't operating
system its on that list

335
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,620
okay wait a second of a second page okay

336
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,370
um on by default so how many of you are
now running ipv6

337
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,310
a lot more aren't you kinda scary isn't
it

338
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:34,310
they forgot to tell us that name know
the BlackBerry does not run ipv6 are

339
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,889
capable of doing

340
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:41,470
networking okay

341
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,470
let's go to the next component so well

342
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,850
we want to find out their devices will

343
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,150
are running ipv6 well here's three tests

344
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,740
real simple a.m. type in any there's
three commands will come back with a

345
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,330
result

346
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,590
which describe the results %uh those
with XP XP has it

347
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,449
pickens you can simply type ipv6
installing on storm system

348
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:11,110
and by the way that can be used by bad
guys pretty easily to install v6 without

349
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,770
you knowing it

350
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:18,770
its homicide no over and talk about that
in a minute

351
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:25,790
opens a by the way slides a I have an
email address the email me and I'll drop

352
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,629
you the slides in PDF format

353
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,580
with all those crazy pictures and yes so

354
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,060
the next compile we've got to deal with
is infrastructure

355
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,159
the currently Internet Service Providers
come in four different flavors

356
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,700
we have the ipv4 only weird sure gonna
have to use a transition or a tunnel

357
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,260
technology we go into the details that
meant

358
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,470
we also have ipv4 were

359
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,280
ISP that they put the transition
mechanism

360
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,660
on your local network bill dole
literally give you a router

361
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,250
that has the transition mechanism
pre-configured you drop in on your

362
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:02,950
network

363
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,240
your internal network is completely v6

364
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,290
they handle all the back end we then
have

365
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,930
very few vendors that support v4 and v6

366
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,280
and in just two countries we have

367
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,560
b6 only environments by the way this is
a

368
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,840
a no not tearing down any company but
all the major carriers and cable

369
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,350
companies have projects

370
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:29,480
upgrade their infrastructure and if you
call any oven they'll say

371
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,160
yes we can support ipv6 but we can give
you firm date or

372
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,830
you know it's a future van or its owner
roadmap for not to show you kid what it

373
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,520
looks like

374
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,670
um or customers aren't asking for TSO

375
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,080
please go ass to make know the youth ask
them

376
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,629
for it and a lot of them have chosen

377
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,040
I not actually implement this technology
and

378
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,690
could cause some problems long-term so

379
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:02,430
now we've determined the ISP's here's
one set of mechanisms

380
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,600
mostly operating systems we

381
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,750
had on those two other tables support
transition mechanisms by default

382
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:14,010
we have a transition mechanism by the
name 624

383
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,570
that is ipv6 riding over ipv4 packets
using protocol

384
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,020
forty-one we have I sit out and we have
territo

385
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,220
and married oh yes you can put Tere Dil
on your BSD

386
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:33,360
and it's very easy to do the installing
lot of 1x installs

387
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,690
others at the endpoints the protocols

388
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,870
and and configurations nosers love

389
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:45,360
endpoints their public K

390
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,770
with the other mechanism where we can
use tunnels here's the real really good

391
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,080
companies that support

392
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,090
North America give you address is

393
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,570
and either provide support for now turn
on mobility the

394
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:04,340
Riverside Ian src make candles if you go
to each other web sites

395
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,850
I a lot times will give in
configurations if you're running Linux

396
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,710
UNIX Solaris so %uh sects

397
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,620
I you can configure it very very easily

398
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,770
if you're the website say tell you how
to do it if its Microsoft box you can

399
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,970
download a piece a

400
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,300
little piece a binary in support that
one specific address

401
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:28,330
or whole network

402
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,600
by the way this is the commercial
versions

403
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,740
free home user version and they have a
very nice anonymous

404
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:42,120
version so sick a look at some the
common for bill is again v6 is a

405
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,300
good environment unfortunately all the
vendors that we do business with comfort

406
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,260
got to tell us they turned it on

407
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:53,160
thing buddy ever run into wireless
access points turned on by default

408
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,130
because the vendors thought was a great
idea

409
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,210
individualistic in

410
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,930
here since seven issues that I've
identified

411
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:10,960
and over the last five years and doing
assessments testing talking to people

412
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,970
of first I T and security management is

413
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:17,580
unaware the risk there things like Tere
Dil

414
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:20,780
allow us to tunnel through and that
firewall

415
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,820
and it has its own problems

416
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:29,450
lot sums are not willing to find any
ipv6 so we can ensure tools are there

417
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:34,600
and network administration security
administrators don't know they're there

418
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,060
on how if you do any auditing
assessments penetration testing

419
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:43,159
K you guys do you like sarbanes-oxley or
hit their it whatever

420
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:50,010
what happens if you miss a protocol is
an assessment valid or not

421
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,570
have you guys been testing for ipv6 has
your auditors been testing for ipv6

422
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,600
hoops could be a problem than

423
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,600
um a lot of our walls are capable

424
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,780
are fully supporting ipv6

425
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,899
so we have to look for those

426
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,620
we have to have the ability to shut it
down enable it configured properly

427
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,410
and over the last few years we've seen a
lot of firewalls economy got there

428
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,900
love the vendors are telling us sir v6

429
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,570
compliant compatible losing lots o words
by a lot from him and third-party tested

430
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,330
say need a

431
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,389
do some research on that the IDS is an
IPS is how many versus

432
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,600
depend on those yes I

433
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,640
Lance spitzer um actually announced on
my list in 2002

434
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,180
that is snort didn't detect an ipv6
packet attacking

435
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,740
successfully attack easel a response one
in the people on the next message

436
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,140
said who I went back a year and I
noticed that my ideas I had to go

437
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,790
through packet traces

438
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:57,970
my ID s didn't detect um

439
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,660
ipv6 yes I too was compromised sets all
the way back to 2001

440
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,590
please make sure your ideas and viral
support ipv6 canción can properly

441
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,200
process some

442
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
on security product industry for the
last five years they've been

443
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,880
interviewing all the

444
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,630
product vendors most of them are the
same as the ISP's will get there

445
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,480
nobody's asking for it

446
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,060
demanded today we really don't have the
time we don't want another wireless

447
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,440
scenario

448
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,340
on also unpack systems up the

449
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:36,050
voter Billy specifically to the protocol
and implementation the protocol has been

450
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,399
increasing this year

451
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,130
it's doubled since last year so over the
next 2-3

452
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,300
years we should start seeing nom a lot
of vulnerabilities

453
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,360
get out there perhaps the system's

454
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,150
so here's the answer to your question so
can I compromises system well

455
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,660
if farm we have a lab system

456
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,200
and we have our target across the
internet and

457
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,160
we attempt to do it on before we have
good firewalls

458
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,310
right with IDS is attacked those things

459
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,909
unfortunately most environments by
default do not in

460
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,170
stole the v6 firewall

461
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,440
that's the number-one Vollmer Billy
we've detected is people

462
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,780
implement fire walls and v6 isn't on on
their hosts

463
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,149
on their systems fact we're just talking

464
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,980
with a group that I came up with a bit
their systems for naval

465
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,530
um so if we if you can see that we did a
pain

466
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,320
and it dropped we do trace rail it
dropped

467
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,950
if take a look at the trace route we
were able to get all the way into the

468
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,130
system then we ran en masse can

469
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,270
put a 113 35

470
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,030
seem unaware of racism that would be mmm

471
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,820
mmm do wanna notice remember earlier I
mentioned the

472
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,220
um hexadecimal decimal issue

473
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,290
take a look at that little table there
the

474
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:07,540
and take a look at the ipv6 addresses
cf44

475
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,720
f7 120 d and they see a repeat itself
don't you

476
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,340
well if we take that v6 address and map
a TV for which is a decimal address when

477
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,320
we get there we

478
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,629
68 247 1813

479
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,340
hmm there might be a problem if somebody
wanted to use scanning network

480
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,240
range that we are ready now this is the
default

481
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,870
624 again most the operating systems you
guys are running

482
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:38,370
already have the v6 64

483
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,340
enabled so that's where the problem
really comes and

484
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,520
we're we're singing a lot some tools to
make it a little bit easier

485
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,090
unfortunately i am.

486
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:50,740
I'm writing a a penetration tester
defense

487
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,420
class right now do win September which
we're gonna go through these tools and

488
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,530
actually test them

489
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:01,170
for the students and everything this is
just a very short Tulisa you can start

490
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:03,220
doing something today

491
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:09,050
and IP lookup web-based at least you can
check to see v4 v6

492
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,190
the best thing here is the capability of
looking at it viv

493
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,180
the six address and determining it does
it say that this machines and Apple

494
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,710
is it pre-configured 2624 it does all
that calculation for you very quickly

495
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,050
and also allows you to test ICMP v6

496
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,110
pings some more tools

497
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,190
another tool is a 6-2 446 gateways

498
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,170
bring up your browser fired up and from
a v4 internet you can see the sixes

499
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:42,370
our website from v6 internet you can see
v4 address so we can test your

500
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:47,090
test your servers and things like that
to see if those are open

501
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:51,630
um the and maps fidora's wonderful tool

502
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:55,500
I very limited so if you have
expectations you're going to do

503
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,420
something with this

504
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,510
it's not gonna work well remember that
slash 64 dress

505
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:07,020
if you were to start this tool starting
to scan it would take care belt

506
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,340
five thousand years for the current
technology scan the whole range so

507
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:16,070
this tool only really provides one
scanning one address it I'm

508
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,939
and only provides lists pains and full
connect scans

509
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:22,980
so I can be a real problem also you
can't do a v4

510
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,440
and a v6 can at the same time therefore
you're gonna have to think about that

511
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,840
when we're scanning

512
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,880
arm again you don't know with the
Rangers are some additional techniques

513
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,110
of learn to

514
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,190
to find those and over the next few
months you can if I'll be announcing use

515
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:38,380
the different techniques

516
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,160
across different a conferences

517
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,820
a great soul once you have v6 a new
networking you want to play

518
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,110
I this tool kit helps you exploit

519
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:55,100
misconfigured network devices that are
currently running the six everything

520
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:00,170
from Wow redirect your all your network
traffic to me

521
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:03,280
scanner handy a smurf tolls

522
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,430
I remember we talked about the too big
to fragmentation hey

523
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:11,430
router I'm all my package should be real
small

524
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:18,040
kinda problematic %uh so this is another
really good settles

525
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:22,639
de tema peabody interest in a demo many
real-life examples

526
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,679
here okay so

527
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,379
I have this little thing that maybe have
fits in my hand

528
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:34,779
I went to this website ipv6 done what is
mine v6 dot com in case they might want

529
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,250
to write that down player on to their
little

530
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:42,639
tiny devices they may have in their
hands are other things

531
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,069
it came back with an ipv6 address and we
said

532
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,620
haha was connected to our wireless lan:

533
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,389
he said from this interesting this
little portable device has this

534
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm wonder what's going on sweet and
took a look

535
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,430
and we found out that this 624 was
enabled and

536
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,680
routing already meeting even know this

537
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,910
came to us from the store by default
like this

538
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:14,190
we also had the icy tapped the automatic
timing pseudo I don't have the second

539
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,000
sly words is

540
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,430
Tunnel adapter automatic time pseudo
there's another

541
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,730
addresses provided there so we

542
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,240
unplugged it we found this information

543
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,750
so we restore the family said F must be
a mistake turn off the wifi

544
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,490
guess what we end up with another dress
win that the default gateway

545
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,450
on the handset so saddened 2002

546
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,939
is a 624 we also found the

547
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,570
I sit ap having the EFI eighty which
many had to row ball dresses out to the

548
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,010
Internet

549
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,270
had exactly the same gateway Sui Sui try
the browser and

550
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,350
lo and behold we were able to axis a

551
00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:00,240
v6 network so that could be real problem

552
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,740
so then we said mean what we do with the
address is now we can resolve it is the

553
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,300
quality record just like we did before
we took the

554
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,470
before dresses we may have to do the air
v6 addresses we mapped in the four

555
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,360
we ended up with two ranges ipv4 dresses

556
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,360
for a provider that was pretty amazing
and it had the same gateway

557
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:26,000
on by the way the 19 288 9 9.1 is a

558
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,930
default gateway on within b6 for one the
transition mechanisms

559
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:36,580
so he said he quit race route to it look
we can trace route to this phone by the

560
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:40,819
way this was two years ago

561
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:45,270
I had to do my due diligence make sure
that

562
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:49,320
people were hurt and inform them that
they had problems in a said thank you

563
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,360
very much

564
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,650
and well what can I say

565
00:36:54,650 --> 00:37:01,650
your questions

566
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:15,010
in the case a love he and the case is
this particular found you see the FFF p

567
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:22,010
that's actually a self assigned address

568
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:34,569
no no that's not a want the end

569
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,010
yes with this transition mechanism the
eyes he was actually provide for 64 to

570
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,680
create a global address my local system
was crazy the other 64

571
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,770
K so we said

572
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:54,240
whom we can trace route to it what else
can we do it reports canewell

573
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,560
two-and-a-half years ago 1/2 years ago
in three months ago

574
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,730
we could import scanned the four tall
and we had

575
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,140
very handy ports open again we on with
the operating system s

576
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,670
mazing the enough after I provide this
presentation back to the provider

577
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,900
on two weeks ago and things have changed

578
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,400
they um change the default gateway

579
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,260
they disabled the DNS what a record so I
can browse on my

580
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,720
in the device come to drag

581
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,760
and all the sudden I'm getting IP four
showing off field reports

582
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,890
and tried and map and hear some the
problems we found

583
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,049
some this was a device we and week and
mapped it

584
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:43,810
on a SUN the data transmission failures
on the device itself we were unable to

585
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:44,390
transmit

586
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:49,430
and a battery life was amazing how the
battery life we kept on plugging in NN

587
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,399
it ran out power with about two hours

588
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,970
tackle and got really hot we had to
reset it

589
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,820
so the reconfigured itself so it cool
down enough and got date again

590
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,240
this might be a problem NK

591
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,370
insert bad stuff here you guys are very
creative

592
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:16,020
mmm yeah okay so

593
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,290
which operating system we were running
yes

594
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,430
noble five miles 6 and by the way we've
tested other operating systems we can

595
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,399
form the other operating system vendors
and

596
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I again I'm trying practice do the right
thing and now I'm

597
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,490
not expose but there's others that have
it so well which phones so we know

598
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,880
this is only a smallest have some the
fans we found no we

599
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,250
blackberry curve doesn't do it and the
the

600
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,410
serb psychic although would have been
fun K

601
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,649
which provider anybody know for other
providers to

602
00:39:55,650 --> 00:40:02,650
okay so to end it

603
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,960
it's been a pleasure %uh get hold me if
you have any questions

604
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,960
thanks

605
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,100
K
