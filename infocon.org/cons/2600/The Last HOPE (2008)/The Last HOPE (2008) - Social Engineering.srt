1
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:05,910
the

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,030
go you happy

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,820
alright alright

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:20,600
but just too many of your friends
yourself

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,600
thank you that's very nice here where
the most popular up panels

6
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:37,070
at any hope conference the his ass
social engineering

7
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,190
some of the funniest phone calls I've
ever heard in my life

8
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:53,680
were done in this room on this panel
social engineering isn't just %ah

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,239
phone calls there's all sorts of
exploits you can do

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,629
you'd be amazed how many concert you can
get into despite holding the clipboard

11
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,899
having a walkie-talkie and looking
really annoyed anybody the talks to you

12
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,560
quit my secrets companies I I even got
into a corn concert that way and I don't

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,610
even like corn

14
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,090
and but

15
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,830
we know the things a little behind
tonight the 10 p.m. mine Gracia talk

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,170
XSS XSS MITM attacks

17
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,570
will start after kevin mitnick's
discussion so

18
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,009
up without further ado as a social
engineering

19
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:37,009
okay are we all having fun

20
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:45,100
the good I

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,200
yeah this is this is the most fun panel
I think I'll we've had this is the first

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,369
help 1994

23
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,500
always kind of we share stories we try
to make some phone calls sometimes it

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,530
works sometimes it doesn't

25
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,840
the mostly I think we educate people as
to how easy it is to get information

26
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,820
that we're really not supposed to have
an

27
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,040
that's sort of what makes it so much fun
in the first place I like 2am

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,549
introduce people maybe I'm the first
response for that photograph can talk

29
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:15,549
first Ohio birdie S

30
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:21,590
how did you get the photo and welcome to
the land of make believe

31
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,590
a there's

32
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,720
yet neuter about now this is the hope

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,510
police the hope the hope eric's and

34
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,329
I was in New Jersey New Jersey Turnpike
a couple weeks ago and I passed that

35
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:35,830
sign

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,500
had to get past those signs and I had to
get a picture this

37
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,150
so further on down the road you can see
with a green sign is

38
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,880
I pulled off the turnpike and I

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,500
got out with my camera and then moments
later to your state troopers pulled up

40
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,070
behind me

41
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,010
and wanna know what I was doing I was
well off the road in a grassy area

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,350
but a I had to make up a

43
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,109
okay to give a quick story because I
know the pulling over there probably was

44
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,430
a fine double offense I didn't wanna
your

45
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,190
uncomfortable please situation so I said
a really important piece a paper blew

46
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,230
out my window

47
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,280
and a blue back behind with this this
blue and brown sign was

48
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,810
and two I really need to find that
because a

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,840
the 1i have 22 reasons why I had to find
in any case they like well

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,840
of will help you find it then so i
thought well I might as well take

51
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,240
advantage of this and get them to go up
by the sign so I can take a picture of

52
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,980
them with

53
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,800
them in it and

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,310
you can see on their so there's to
nurture state New Jersey State Troopers

55
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,720
a in the land of make believe

56
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,260
from the hope eric's and a the social
engineering here wasn't getting them to

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,200
not find me

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,870
and to get them in this photo so I
didn't have to get any information from

59
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,430
them

60
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,600
but it's another example a social
engineering and remember this

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,120
the police are your friends they will do
all sorts of things for you if they

62
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,790
believe you have the authority

63
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:07,040
I to to have them help you its it's
really kinda cool thing

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,450
we have fun one the greatest social
engineering

65
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,730
engineering tools downstairs you guys
know what it is they wanna guess

66
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,670
sorry now I give you a hint it's outside

67
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:24,920
yes the fan that van is the biggest
social engineering 2002 I've ever seen

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,410
because

69
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,080
when people see the phone company then
they just assume you've got a third

70
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,310
and what's really caught my eye sockets
on the radio this week

71
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,160
even though that this thing was painted
in 1994

72
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,790
and it has the old coal right and and
blue I

73
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,660
Bell stripes bryce has now you know
there is some ugly color their their red

74
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,550
black and white

75
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,600
their trucks have not look anything like
that in years yet they still wave at

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,860
this truck when it goes by is if it's
one of them

77
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,240
I can still pull into

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,310
any phone company garage or are fenced
in area and they will open it

79
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,270
I guess they thinking that while that's
a long service call here from the coming

80
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,659
home the

81
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,690
but I think I think the most fun I had

82
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,219
was when I was moving a friend of mine a
few weeks ago and I have you guys heard

83
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,450
about this but there is a %uh there's a
crane collapse in New York City

84
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,620
a month or two ago whenever you see a
crane up in the air New York City

85
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,050
eventually it's gonna collapse

86
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,940
and this one collapse literally the day
before I was going to move my friend so

87
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,950
the whole street was closed off

88
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,940
and nobody could go up or down the thing
I was it was packed full of cops

89
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,650
literally a hundred cop to standing
around that even though they were

90
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,900
supposed to be doing they just knew that
the street was close well

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,710
I told my friend I had the van and
that's what the 2600 and is mostly used

92
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,099
for is moving my friends

93
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,960
and so I'm going down second avenue and
and the street

94
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,169
I is a one way street going west essence

95
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,620
for stephanie was close I couldn't
approach it that way so I had to

96
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,979
approach it the wrong way

97
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,990
is going to 2nd Avenue had to make a
left turn into a one way street going

98
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,700
the wrong way

99
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,750
and this was barricaded by cops I
figured

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,100
I was gonna get yelled at immediately
for going not only going down to close

101
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,410
Street going the wrong way into a close
to read but the most

102
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,270
amazing thing happened the CAF just
moved away and open the barricade

103
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,690
pictured this is amazing what can I get
away with here.

104
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,150
it got better because I had to back the
van to my friend's apartment

105
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,580
and there was a whole punch a cop just
standing there they were smoking

106
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,760
cigarettes talking on the cell phone
just like

107
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,310
you know didn't have anything to do is
we just all hanging out and this was

108
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,940
sort of

109
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,350
I guess was pay back for RNC because I
backed the van

110
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,190
I've been back into the cops fast-acting
really really slowly

111
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,950
like one mile an hour and they disperse

112
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,460
I I got a creeper cops to disperse how
cool is that

113
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,140
self

114
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,260
so the 2600 van can be used for
incredible lack social engineering and

115
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:02,460
getting people to move would never move
for you normally as I think one way of

116
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,010
doing that

117
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,240
and apparently the would not those
police officers could read

118
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,190
because it clearly says the hacker work
early on it

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,990
they were all very nice bit that they
just didn't seem like cops think they're

120
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,590
all hang around not knowing what to do
and they weren't and hostile mode

121
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,630
because there are no demonstrators but

122
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,080
anyway so thats that's one story I will
tell you many more

123
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,150
I not kevin is here ok hello

124

actually sent off the hook I'm not have

125
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,380

126
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,180

about the mission elevator no yes no one

thanks anyway up yeah and I'm

136
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:14,090
excited to tell stories I am the right
man this is a

137
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,380
Sid Vicious the world's hacker dog is
really the socialist

138
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,290
I'll try to

139
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,610
maybe I'll tells couple stores assault
his exploits but it definitely is a

140
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,650
if the park every social situation works
out pretty good

141
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,520
citizen IRC off by the way on our hands
on 26 entered on that it takes care of

142
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,380
it trolls

143
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:42,380
everything so and I'm the Cheshire
catalyst

144
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:51,050
you those of you who don't know whether
applauding

145
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:58,050
I'm the guy with my own area code
alright

146
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:03,629
on our I all I can you how great

147
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,139
arm there's always later it's always
very stressful because you never know

148
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,639
what to do and I

149
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,629
it's always a good chance it's not going
to work it really shouldn't work things

150
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:14,420
we get away with but maybe maybe we
could preface

151
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,319
has anyone done anything social
engineering lies on the telephone

152
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:18,040
recently

153
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,529
got information they weren't supposed to
get gone people

154
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,949
to help them out I miss you always if
you when somebody sympathy over they'll

155
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:28,959
tell you all kinds a bit of information
I was I was listening to something with

156
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,929
a beyond hope

157
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,129
where we call the blockbuster video and
we were just

158
00:09:33,129 --> 00:09:36,899
talking to a representative there and I
played the part of an angry husband

159
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:40,899
who had who had gotten really upset at
the fact that he had just come home from

160
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,610
a holiday and there is this this leafy
waiting for I'm

161
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,429
and either I didn't know who is using
the card I need to know all the people

162
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:49,459
using my card

163
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:52,549
well except the thing is I don't really
know what last name is being years so I

164
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:53,529
try this one

165
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:56,589
RS now that you know I'm we base this
one for all these names and the

166
00:09:56,589 --> 00:09:57,619
perception or

167
00:09:57,619 --> 00:10:00,670
I'm person at the at the front desk I

168
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,748
was just giving me everybody's
information addresses names videos that

169
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:05,540
they were renting

170
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,610
all because I was exasperated trying to

171
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,149
help me out so that I could 60
situations I was trying to help them out

172
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,679
as trying to pay this late fee which
really didn't exist

173
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,619
but it was an indication of how easy it
is to get somebody to tell you something

174
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:19,600
they really shouldn't tell you

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,709
another time we call the Starbucks and
I'll

176
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,740
we ask them if they're having trouble
with their cash register which of course

177
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,670
they were

178
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,279
and we got them to sort a breed of the
last few transactions because we're

179
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,119
afraid it wouldn't go through and I
started reading a credit card numbers

180
00:10:34,119 --> 00:10:38,079
we you know where we were pretty high
where

181
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,879
response for people here so we lower the
volume that didn't get out we

182
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,689
interrupted her

183
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:45,449
but yeah people can give and also to
information and you know what I bet a

184
00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:47,829
lot of you give out information you're
not supposed to give our

185
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,350
piece of securing them you probably
given that to the phone company when you

186
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,139
don't have to

187
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,119
or anyone else who asks for it and we
thank you for asking for ourselves and

188
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:55,819
see how many view

189
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:01,049
fell for that we didn't are it some it's
amazing as a social networking people

190
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,730
just give out all this information about
themselves and that s

191
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:09,119
that's a boon to anybody who wants to to
find out information and not posted

192
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:13,350
have access to people with their class
schedules online %ah they have all their

193
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,059

favorite likes and dislikes in secret
desires and things like that they post

195
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:18,399
them

196
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,899
because they want to share with other
people who might feel the same way but

197
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:21,529
it's really

198
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:24,679
it's really getting all kinds
information out there that

199
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:29,129
added together it's your life you know

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,100
my friend run for about 15 more minutes

306
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,890
and for will leave okay you guys can go

307
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,900
let's go we make a beeline right for the
elevator

308
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:24,000
to get out of that building go down the
elevator of the street we go down about

309
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,440
three or four blocks week watch the
front door

310
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,220
the hollywood CEO but say about seven to
ten minutes pass

311
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,460
and you see that same security guard
first thing out the door

312
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,900
down the street is looking for a
sorceress other kind of laughing at a

313
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,280
time

314
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,320
but was a real scary experience because
we thought we were gonna bust

315
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,070
but on those social engineering helped
us out of that situation

316
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,340
never underestimate people's stupidity
when

317
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,470
when getting information now I'm serious
I

318
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,910
this is something a friend of mine and
actually did when he was about

319
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,490
I guess 16 or 17 he he and I i couple by
the people

320
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,420
arm went to a central office arm

321
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,440
and basically convinced the guard at the
central office that they were there

322
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,610
to collect the old ladies because they
were gonna deliver the new ones

323
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,140
fucking guard gave him his ID card

324
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,640
this is how trusting people can be

325
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,030
I got a better one remember the days of
the PBS

326
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,080
you won't hear from a PBS days well

327
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,750
a there was a southerner hacker on the
14th Homer Cumbrian he was locked up in

328
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,490
Stockton

329
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,710
and we want to get the test number
directory for Pacific Bell all the

330
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,700
different us numbers

331
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,840
was actually pacific telephone &
Telegraph said okay

332
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,909
are you willing to pick it up if I can
get them to leave it outside their door

333
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,480
because what you talking about so don't
worry watch in a three-way in the

334
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,340
central office

335
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,629
and actually tell the same story there
were giving them

336
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,820
the new directories I and two they have
to say a

337
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,370
leave though the after the all
directories outside the door because we

338
00:19:57,370 --> 00:19:58,220
have to shred them

339
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,540
needed after an outside the normal now
works more often and then you would

340
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,990
expect I

341
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,450
are going to try something here I no
guarantee to some work

342
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,720
I had a bit of a I'm a tussle with some
car services over this last week because

343
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,000
are some people who want to send

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,300
on cars for at airports and you know
what it's really kinda weird when if you

345
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,720
wanna

346
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,780
a I taps my pick up at an airport you
can't really do it

347
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,060
it you have to you have to have the
credit card on you when you get dropped

348
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,629
off that's very hard if you're paying
for somebody else and we're trying to

349
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,440
ask me how

350
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,140
how's it possible to actually pay for
somebody if you don't have a big

351
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,140
corporate account

352
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,200
I call the person has to have the credit
card on Amazon as a whole big thing

353
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,420
people on the taking taxis I so yeah are
our first things with the car service

354
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,970
but in order to get the information

355
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:47,500
for the car service are we have to get
information from an airline go try to

356
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,190
first for this is easy because this is
completely above board

357
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,330
I just wanna find out to all the flights
coming into JFK tomorrow from los

358
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,669
angeles flight numbers

359
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,910
and I guess the biggest challenge here
are beginning a human

360
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,730
on the phone Seaholm hardest to do that
you have to sort have fun

361
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,570
scream representative at some point and
I might have to do that

362
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:11,129

398
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:23,669
years so my friends down here where they

399
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:28,200
up you know what now one night you know
it out thing I was about 12 or 13 years

400
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,720
old

401
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,889
I am somebody said you know I bet you

402
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:36,169
yes malicious twelve-years-old you know

403
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,789
try to do whatever I can on so I call up
somebody pretending to be the local

404
00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:44,649
was at the electric company which is
deep you know where I live on

405
00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:47,700
and as it turned out a it

406
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,460
ended up being a lot later than I
thought it was so was probably about ten

407
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,049
thirty eleven o'clock at night

408
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:56,899
big mistake I the people

409
00:23:56,899 --> 00:24:00,479
somehow it they did a a police trace on
the phone

410
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:05,159
I about three or four days later I got a
call from a police substation

411
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:09,480
a asking to speak with my parents when I
told them I was 13

412
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,309
I said the yeah now no thank you and
hung up

413
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:16,450
they call back hung up call back hung up

414
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,720
cell phone and they tried this for about
a week trying to get a hold of us

415
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,859
and I know the fact is that all you have
to do is got a cell phone

416
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:27,499
hang up and nobody can do anything to
you so

417
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,580
we all get caught sometimes and it's not
the end of the world

418
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,210
one

419

I'm with over one to the Public Service
Commission hearing

446
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,490

447
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,520
a well I get to the hearing and I

454

455
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,950

like I said that with neighbors who on
to verify somebody was on a particular

547
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:19,960
flight if you knew that somebody was
traveling from Los Angeles to New York

free we didn't really accomplish
anything but we got her to totally

627
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,329
believe our story and become sympathetic
and all that and that's ninety percent

628
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:02,540
of it right there you get people on your
side

629
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,210
you tell ridiculous story about how your
wife mess something up in

630
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,770
you know there they'll be on your side
giving advice even and sympathy and all

631
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,200
that

632
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,300
and you'll just have a good feeling that
while they really care even though you

633
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,720
don't really exist in that form

634
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,940
again I i have more but

635
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,240
me rest tell story or something you want
to know

636
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,640
got another method is I wanna my phone
but

637
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,700
you ask for innocuous information

638
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:34,980
from that lady likes the stuff that she
would normally make a reservation number

639
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,750
and you ask several questions over na
Kiss information when you go to the

640
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:39,900
sensitive information

641
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:43,119
usually they'll give that up to because
they're already in a pattern if giving

642
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:43,910
out information

643
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,569

something a hard the farm

645
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,069

any I the first year you met him you
paddle out and talk to them in the

655
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,099
second year

656
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:23,250

DEF concept Alexis parking had to get to

661
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,619
the hotel manager involved and the Def
Con scary stuff involving eventually he

662
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:44,270
was allowed

663
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,960
and then years after that you allowed is
easy to get him and after that

664
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,109
but he's helped me get out a speeding

730
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:58,529
or share stories too if you guys have
any social sharing stories appear on

731
00:46:58,529 --> 00:46:59,460
which are like to hear them

732
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,950
get some inspiration actually got a call
on Thursday morning from what I've later

733
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:05,950
found out BAE

734
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:09,869
sirs scammers that have been pretty well
circulating around the internet calling

735
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:10,640
all over the country

736
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,259
trying to separate people from their
money would you like their phone number

737
00:47:14,259 --> 00:47:18,980
I we can give it to us by wouldn't give
it to us up with all these people

738
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:19,859
because you know

739
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:23,839
few on oh they're scammers that well I
mean you say they're scammers but

740
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:24,650
they're probably

741
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:29,319
a investment bankers and their def this
is like but definitely shared

742
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:32,509
send us an email or handed to us and we
can look into them

743
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:36,809
a lot of times when happy wants all now
I you type a phone number into it

744
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:40,680
Google and you get all the stories of
people that had the same thing happen to

745
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,009
them

746
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:45,690
and it's it's incredible what you can
learn from a company always whenever you

747
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,089
visit somebody you don't know

748
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,859
typing their name type in the phone
number see if other people have had

749
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:50,980
experiences with them

750
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,299
if you get telemarketing call from some
weird place you don't think it's is

751
00:47:54,299 --> 00:47:54,950
quite right

752
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:58,750
use google and find out all kinds of
other things about them with other

753
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,730
people have experienced

754
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:03,250
definitely do your research before
giving out any information

755
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,000
okay second on this fine we have two
microphones the first guy have

756
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,190
mortgage on this one I got that one x I
dislike you make that call in about half

757
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:12,359
hour court right back

758
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:15,990
as I like a call I got back in half an
hour at the ritz-carlton

759
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:20,259
yeah but I'll be on my cell phone then
really i'd in the back

760
00:48:20,259 --> 00:48:24,359
yet decide sharing our general story

761
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:27,650
I or even like just a general
recommendation

762
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,970
are the easiest ways to find a common
ground for example

763
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:35,400
I'm with Oregon so if I see eleven
American you that common ground we start

764
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,680
speaking into Spanish

765
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,710
and they open up a whole lot that they
would have hope in

766
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:43,029
opened up previously like for example
the other way I was in are

767
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:47,420
subways are and the previous customer
was just giving them a lot of shit

768
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:50,569
so but you know sometimes you can tell
you can

769
00:48:50,569 --> 00:48:54,250
you get to like I know this guy speak
Spanish so the I leave iced I talked to

770
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:54,769
him like

771
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:57,890
yeah you know while he was given you a
lot of shit in Spanish

772
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,480
and without me noticing I take myself

773
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,819
and I notice that he got put to Esther
cookies for me so

774
00:49:04,819 --> 00:49:08,630
you know I don't know that it's likely
counts but that was totally a win for me

775
00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,819
you can get very far by using a very
thick accent doesn't have to be an

776
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:15,220
existing language but

777
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:21,089
just I you just talks so slowly and get
all these words wrong and they they will

778
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:24,078
they will do whatever they can to get
you off the phone I'll tell you there

779
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:25,599
their address their phone number

780
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,200
just just don't because sometimes these
representatives they've they've they

781
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,380
really like slaves they

782
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:33,859
they came and hang up they they have the
headset attach their head they only hang

783
00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:34,650
up on that the way

784
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:37,710
for the customer to hang up before they
get connected next call's

785
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:41,390
also technique when you talk to somebody
on the phone

786
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,269
that you don't want to talk to hang up
well you're talking

787
00:49:45,269 --> 00:49:52,269
that must have been accidental I and I
question the front I don't know if

788
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:55,019
anyone hears from jacksonville florida

789
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:58,359
arm but there's a radio station and this
is

790
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:03,470
all over the rural south will find these
they're callin bargain radio stations

791
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,259
and I'll say their phone number
over-the-air choosing FM

792
00:50:07,259 --> 00:50:10,440
band a little bit below the commercial
band between religious stations

793
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,380
and you they will have buyers numbers
you can call

794
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,440
this say the station say they say don't
answer your on the air mediately

795
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,130
and and I'll say hello what you want is
JJ XR

796
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:25,609
and then you say hi and bye remember 806
JV

797
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:31,819
I'd like 50 truckloads uva Purina Dog
Chow delivered to my house and I'll

798
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:35,579
usually put it in the system under
whoever's buyer numbers that is and you

799
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:38,269
can usually figure out the fire number
just by listening to two or three of

800
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:38,589
them

801
00:50:38,589 --> 00:50:42,380
and then you've got about thirty seconds
on the air to say whatever you want

802
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,740
before they chop you off

803
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:48,990
so look the stations up one who's in Jax
called the BJ XR

804
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:54,230

welcome here

805
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:58,079

think you could

806
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,049

airline but you could probably see if

807
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:02,759

808
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:05,960

811
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,880

842
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,280
revel in the back row ahead make it
quick

843
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,460
I like to mention social engineering you
from

844
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:15,650
where everybody knows what all marketing
you day it's annoying when they call you

845
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,870
in the call you with

846
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:21,000
numbers at this point the caller ID and
when they spot the caller ID that

847
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,760
when you try to call back it's a
disconnected number and nobody can call

848
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,700
what I do is I had to change my number
that wasn't the reason I change my

849
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,100
number but I change my number

850
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:34,090
they had the nerve cuts my phone numbers
listed in the phonebook

851
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:37,560
they have the nerve to look at my phone
number look at me

852
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:40,570
and call the new number now guess what I
have to do

853
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:43,940
thanks to you in manual either in this
from you change

854
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,260
my last name in the directory and you
could do that without a charge

855
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,600
you don't have to pay that unlisted to
her you know

856
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,630
gotta pay usually get the name unlisted

857
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,620
first name remains the same the last
name to change

858
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:01,400
so in other words now when they try and
look up your name are well

859
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,980
it's not listed so hopefully this whole
marketing was not so that

860
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,200
education you got to basically know how
to social engineer people know how to

861
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,800
to to do these okay thank you

862
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,510

868
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:33,620
some useful advice

869

letterhead and

879
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:07,420

obviously but I said what there's got to

880
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,260
be an easy way to make these friggin
shirt so I just started looking for the

if you prefer even if you're not with
the theater pretending you're in theater

885
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:26,400
allows you to do a lot of stuff like all
these are fake weapons I can transport

886
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,860
them into this far the city because
we're doing a production
