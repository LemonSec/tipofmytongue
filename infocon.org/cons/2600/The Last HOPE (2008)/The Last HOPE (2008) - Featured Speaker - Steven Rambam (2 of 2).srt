1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,220
that's bob bob is at work I love this
example

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,559
this is a real example Massachusetts

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,429
DMV the driver's license people
Massachusetts couple years ago when they

4
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:14,769
were

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:18,380
implementing their their facial
recognition program

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,930
i mean you know they were up late with
pizza

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,080
jolt cola they will punch you the 602
humor comes out so they said

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,090
let's test this out let's get

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,079
some photos from the Americas Most
Wanted website and

10
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,519
let's compare it to the Massachusetts
you in the driver's license photo

11
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:38,350
database

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,239
and they did actually called ago they
call the state police they said you're

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,379
not gonna believe this

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,530
State Police's yup it's really

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,890
Robert Howell and they want to rush them
New York Times article

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,280
sometimes article from a

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,850
earlier this year Illinois implemented

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,100
facial recognition with their driver's
licenses ran a program to compare all

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,950
the drivers licenses against all the
other driver's licenses

20
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,439
to the tech people getting multiple
drivers licenses for a whole buncha

21
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:13,890
people

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:20,890
now we're not the government a really
annoying

23
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:26,979
television producer came to me he said
lesson you've got all this technology

24
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,520
K you just run databases

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,820
on photos and names and catch wanted
people without going out for working

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,710
from an isometric

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,399
of course this is what up this is watch
Archer to do the story said

28
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,619
nevermind a curious

29
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,149
so I went to the state of Illinois child
support

30
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,549
enforcement database go home try this
yourself

31
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,240
it's unbelievably easy you can write

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,729
an algorithm will do this anybody ca
here's a guy

33
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,560
Blaine who

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,929
less pay child support 2007 ne-yo's
forty thousand

35
00:02:07,929 --> 00:02:13,620
806 dollars his MySpace page with all
this information

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,940
ferriers and the links for use with

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,560
summers on for child support X 1024

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,390
he ever got Ronald who

39
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,290
less paid 2007 Rios almost a hundred
thousand bucks 99,000

40
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,659
sixty six dollars a

41
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,150
their arses wanted poster there's as
MySpace page

42
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,030
I want you to work or to look at the
difference between the top forwards like

43
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,370
offering in good shape and happy and
clear of the bottom where

44
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:49,900
he's laying on a couch wearing a t-shirt
you know putting on weight

45
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,069
blurry eyed as MySpace friends so now
you know why

46
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,260
that's where the child support the
sleepless go

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,609
okay so you guys are hackers you learn
about exports and you try to figure out

48
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,180
countermeasures so you where you know

49
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,980
you you decide you know these these
facial recognition cameras are gonna get

50
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,760
me I'm gonna

51
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,500
go to the novelty store and get a
Groucho Marx nose and glasses

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,819
walk down the street or no there are no
official recognition algorithms that are

53
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:24,689
being developed

54
00:03:24,689 --> 00:03:29,250
being made better and better and better
and better on a daily basis almost

55
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,280
that any piece of exposed skin

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,849
can be compared ninety-five percent
accuracy

57
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,099
now for certain things that's crap that
means if you check

58
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:43,700
a thousand people you gonna get 50,000
false positives

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,329
the answer to that is you take that
sucks that a fifty thousand people

60
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:51,640
and you rerun rerun so you're fairly
actor

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,140
but the nose and glasses won't work so
what's a

62
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:03,230
you get a hoodie for up at the Elephant
Man's masking your walk down the street

63
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,099
saying I'm a human too

64
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,560
won't help they will recognize the
Elephant Man's gait recognition

65
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,459
this was first developed I spoke about
this is Steven's

66
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:18,699
this was first developed of course and
surveillance crazy

67
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,759
anyone a few guys remember monty
python's

68
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,770
Ministry of Silly Walks that's probably
to develop

69
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,560
but they have a thing I can tell who you
are by the way you walk

70
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,169
and the proof that it has some potential

71
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,490
FBI is investing up billion dollars I
mean like quite the little guy a billion

72
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,690
dollars

73
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,969
in the technology cameras are gonna be
able to look at how are you walking

74
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,310
where I have to worry

75
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,050
your mask it's Paul with the head over
to your basket

76
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,050
by the way this is one time when
intrusive technology was great this guy

77
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,340
was a pedofile

78
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,210
they found him molesting little children
on data for web sites

79
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,859
that was the original photo Dutch cops
figured out how to

80
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,440
on swirling they rushed so even if you
think you can conceal your photo and do

81
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,569
other things

82
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,699
figure are

83
00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:20,110
so you say they're going to recognize me

84
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,889
they can tell how I walk I'm gonna get
my core

85
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,509
I'm gonna took the windows and I'm gonna
travel safely only like

86
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:31,539
pop out at the last moment to run it

87
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,699
this particular system capturing

88
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:39,180
up to 3,000 license plates in an hour

89
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,310
we have to forward facing cameras

90
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,789
and one side facing camera sat facing
camera

91
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,860
is a at a 90 degree angle and it's
basically for doing

92
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,949
parking lot applications I can go into a
trap

93
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,780
I think that shopping center and dad
drive down the

94
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,030
lanes of the parking lot as I'm doing
that I'm running every single license

95
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,870
plate in a parking lot

96
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,389
forward facing cameras a one is forward
facing

97
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:11,099
to the lane to the left and one is for
facing to the lane to the right

98
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:14,229
and what I'm getting there is sad
typically

99
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:17,340
oncoming cars and

100
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,650
the camera to the right I would be
either callers in the number two man

101
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,750
or causing a paper on the side of the
road

102
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,479
set the screen gives you here is it
gives you an overview picture of the

103
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,080
vehicle

104
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,448
the software then I slow so I suspect
that gives you the pouch

105
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,810
and what you see here in the yellow box
above the a patch

106
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,470
is wet the software actually read the
plate to be

107
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:47,880
so let the other applications for this
system is too frequently checked

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,880
parking lots for vehicles that have
interest to the police

109
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,930
wanna show you but to all of the f10
traffic enforcement only scratched the

110
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,569
surface of what ailed PR's capable of
doing

111
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:06,849
we also happy we get the picture

112
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,409
that's for real this is this if you if
you are observing an off drive down the

113
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,490
interstates

114
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,330
you'll see every overpass every bridge
abutment

115
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,599
every possible place to mount a camera
cameras are now being mounted

116
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,300
if there is a polo if there's a be on
the lookout notice

117
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:29,800
for of driving Subaru license plate ABC
123

118
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,009
it will be programmed into the license
plate recognition alert

119
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,800
the minute you drive down the street a
couple know where you are

120
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
the vector right into that's a good
thing

121
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,030
now bad thing

122
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,240
bob is an annoying hacker we want to
know who is meeting with where he's

123
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,940
going

124
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,860
but he's really sensitive to
surveillance any checks his car for

125
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,919
bumper beepers

126
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:56,590
and he doesn't have an iPhone only takes
the battery out of this fall

127
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:03,039
any pays cash for everything because
still track

128
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,280
couple things and I'm gonna now start
going through this at the speed of life

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,030
because

130
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,650
10 allow time for the Cure it's gotten
so good this is a real quick VT

131
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,060
billboard then I'll go but you look at
the Billboard the Billboard looks back

132
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,970
at you

133
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,569
knows how long you're looking at the
Billboard what you are looking up

134
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:25,610
facial recognition glasses now how many
times have

135
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,990
somebody come up to you all about it
during your sure who is this

136
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:34,530
or you have to do in a couple years hit
a button

137
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,020
oh this is Fred he owes me fifty dollars
and a

138
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,329
you know is always trying to mooch money
offer yeah I'm sorry I don't know you're

139
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,140
go

140
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,439
it's a this is an actual beta testing

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,420
CCTV is just letting you know not very

142
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,079
worthwhile in the real world if you
catch somebody you've got the video you

143
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,410
can use it to convict them

144
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:01,829
but actually using it to catch them not
very effective

145
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,330
now you know the one thing is

146
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,760
photos over crime in progress

147
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,240
I it's a great thing I mean it's a photo
photos don't lie

148
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,050
you know it's not like a photo can be
made to show you doing something

149
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:23,760
you you didn't do your offense offense
that couldn't happen

150
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,920
I love up

151
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:30,550
final word on surveillance cameras okay

152
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,190
one more time from Baltimore

153
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,880
a girl ok

154
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,700
very quickly interpretation of activity
in very few

155
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,160
I've been talking for two hours now how
people watcher and help people track you

156
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,189
and how they gather this

157
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,290
for the most important things is they've
got all the stator how they do it

158
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,319
well they runner through artificial
intelligence programs

159
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
the runner through other programs that
interpreted for them

160
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,180
7 analysts sitting there with printouts
are in front of a computer screen

161
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,810
the computer decides if you're a good
guy or a bad guy

162
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,520
a lot of times it's legit

163
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,610
I mean you check flights to we're on
right before a farming and split

164
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:22,490
you buy a book on fighting cancer either
you or somebody you know as cancer

165
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,630
you read a gay porno movie

166
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,189
you're probably get a you put in address
into MapQuest

167
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,560
you're interested in that address

168
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,200
you fill a prescription for Xanax refill
a prescription for voyeur

169
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,670
DAW is my favorite you're on a plane
four times this year

170
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:47,319
sitting next to the same mormon was not
your wife

171
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,510
I mean on likely it's a coincidence and
it means something

172
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,830
and this is the state of things

173
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,930
her to big programs that are being
constantly worked on an updated

174
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,650
for the US government to interpret that
what is called Norwich dance for non

175
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,990
obvious relationship awareness

176
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,890
this was started in Vegas casinos the
stuff that you see on the show

177
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,750
I think it's called casino or Vegas or
whatever

178
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,340
James Caan place the casino owner and it
shows the zoom in on the guys face on it

179
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,240
immediately tells the murders

180
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,820
and oppose Opus whole history absolutely
larger

181
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,790
casinos really do that I'm really can do
it's being developed for the government

182
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,439
and the example of this when it was
pitched by the casino guys

183
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,560
to the government was the black church
dealer

184
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,990
once shared a telephone number with the
sister the guy I know warning biggest

185
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,170
table

186
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,890
think about that for a sec not hard to
do

187
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:53,410
for a database the something called
advise analysis the seven-nation

188
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,459
visualization inside semantic an answer
only the government can

189
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,200
the this is being developed for DHS

190
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,900
apartment home in secure showing

191
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,770
links between data and all the links
above these links to individual people

192
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,060
in 2004 DHS at their

193
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,630
at their the conference in Virginia that
they held that year

194
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,040
at that time their requirement was
storage

195
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,050
for warn quad trillion works

196
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,200
that now

197
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,400
beyond belief now look

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,730
I'm an investigator I'm not going to say
it appears that your this is all bad

199
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,910
sometimes it's good

200
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,990
when the government actually uses the
right information

201
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,730
in the right way and does its job it
saves lives it could have saved three

202
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,350
thousand lives right here in new york

203
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,450
let me interpret this for you

204
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,740
of the 9/11 hijackers

205
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,750
true were known as all Qaeda terrorists

206
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,680
for coming into this country to do a
terrorist

207
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,450
all his way and all bit or they were no
they were known to the CIA they were

208
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,840
known to the FBI

209
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,580
unfortunately the CIA didn't tell the
FBI they're already in america

210
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,210
that's another story fourteen of the
other terrorist groups linked to them

211
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,990
through the most basic database checks
that even a private investigator

212
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,800
Mohammed of doctoring sure to address

213
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,480
50 the terrorists shared telephone
number with

214
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,880
another terrorist shared a frequent
flyer number

215
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,689
and another terrorists not on the watch
list shared an address

216
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,950
just this basic database matching if
it'd been done

217
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,480
if it had been done in a timely way and
it'd been done efficiently

218
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,890
World Trade Center with conceivably
still be standard

219
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,410
and this would be a different world so
this is not

220
00:13:54,410 --> 00:14:01,410
always a bad thing it's a bad thing want
to use on S&P

221
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,750
now I'm gonna flip through water there
some sort

222
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:12,860
i wanna talk about we're gonna talk five
minutes

223
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:19,600
about a real world case their workers go
to Q&A

224
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,020
when you're an investigator you're
building a profile on somebody

225
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,420
when I teaches classes I tell people
it's like pulling a piece a string

226
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,800
as soon as you have something to pull
onto

227
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,250
something to hold onto and start pulling
you're gonna get more information and

228
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,650
more

229
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:41,750
now here's up very very typical use

230
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,620
you have a telephone number everybody
knows the telephone numbers gonna give

231
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,900
your name and address

232
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,200
from there you get a date of birth and
social security number

233
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,070
bother anybody who doesn't believe you
know demonstrated

234
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:01,240
pass the dresses family members places
of employment businesses corporations

235
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,660
real property public records marriage

237
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,270
you CC's taxes permits licenses

238
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,370
carry permits for gones your driver's
license for motor vehicles

239
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,550
accidents you've been credit reports

240

eight hundred-number course purchasing
histories donations

241
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,630
I don't have a screen big enough it
would go up down the ceiling down the

242
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,460
other wall in the back

243
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,630
as long as you've got a good starting
point you can build up

244
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,520
this is basic database investigation it
start a billion times a day by law

245
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,530
enforcement

246
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:45,430
and private investigators so

247
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:52,430
for relief

248
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,540
two years ago before the hope talk that
was

249
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,640
rudely preempted I went on

250
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,970
of the hawk the 2600 radio show which
you sure orson

251
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,730
I S for volunteer in the next morning
are going to email

252
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,290
are my name's Rick Baker I want to
volunteer army writer

253
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:20,150
gives his very brief contact information
so the first thing I did was I ran the

254
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,720
phone

255
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,870
now obviously a respect for Rick a lot
of the information is gonna be truncated

256
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,600
just for running the phone number were
able to get his name is addresses social

257
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,790
security numbers data birth worry works
in thirties a real person it seems legit

258
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,480
so I gave him a call and I said record

259
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,500
we had a problem in 2004 I did this with
a guy

260
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,840
who I met the day before as a courtesy
support I just like to know what you got

261
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,290
on

262
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,180
so I don't have a heart attack in the
audience I met with the man I should

263
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,350
have everything i gather

264
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,790
and that night I gotta call my office
from his attorney who said I know

265
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,570
he gave you permission but if you do the
presentation I'm gonna sue you

266
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:07,000

lawsuits against so I couldn't do it

267
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,980
2004

268
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,930
I 2006 I had a waiver

269
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,810
and I senator director andric signed

270
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,560
I wanna reach you one key paragraph
Florian which is my agency

271
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,500
may disseminate any information about me
which obtains and/or compiles to any

272
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,580
person in any venue

273
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,250
as it sees fit even if the dissemination
of that information

274
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,710
could cause me harm emotional distress

275
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,410
pain injury humiliation or ridicule

276
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,590
or other personal or financial data
damage

277
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,159
and even if the information disseminated
is partially or completely false

278
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,630
now okay

279
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,920
you know what he signed that and had it
notarized

280
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,000
carries right here and we have good

281
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,880
that site is not going to barter here's
what we didn't do

282
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,030
we spend a morning that's it from
breakfast to a late lunch

283
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,129
no field investigation whatsoever in
some people out there were two do

284
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:16,780
interviews

285
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,460
we didn't do Carballo geo ceilings trash
by the razor

286
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,430
on believable investigative technique we
do pretax return call up his family

287
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,170
say we're calling from the hospital and
you know Rex laying on a

288
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:33,660
a gurney whose is medical insurance
company or idea that good stuff

289
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,020
we can use any government databases we
used

290
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,260
what is available to civilians

291
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,990
I mean well-connected civilians with
civilians we use guerrilla trace reused

292
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:45,790
I R jimmy's

293
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:52,670
you something at the development called
or Inc we started with the phone number

294
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,020
we got his name we got social security
number got his date of birth

295
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,120
we got were reworked we then took to
social security number and RAM that

296
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,360
and we got every name in every address
associated with the

297
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,440
which and this brother is a routine
thing for investigators

298
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,260
because one dollar to do and we got
every addressee ever lived at including

299
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,010
a guy who was

300
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,580
the name of a guy Jeffrey Stanford who
was using social security number

301
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,800
more information for more information
and more information addresses

302
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,080
in less than five minutes we found this
complete name social security number

303
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,139
when he got it where he got it somebody
else using it date of birth the address

304
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,180
and we polled bricks credit report which
he signed a waiver for

305
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,270
I we got every worry banks and how much
money he makes all the importers is ever

306
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:41,840
showed

307
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,270
and how quickly faces he pays a pretty
too quickly

308
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,740
just good to know Asustek Computer and
we found out that he showed us a

309
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,640
property owner at his address

310
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,930
and we pull the property record and we
pull the property appraiser record

311
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,720
which said 89,000 books and we figured
no way

312
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,460
you know not even in this economy and we
want to swallow which is even better

313
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,350
they gave us an appraisal

314
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,850
474,000 284 dollars

315
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,080
and then we decided to take a look at
the property

316
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,350
again without leaving the dusk so we
went we got closer we are closer we are

317

big parking lot

323
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,240

00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,370
real world example

411
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,740
on rock always wanted to say this

412
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,310
but wait there's more now

413
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,330
after reckon I did this we got to be
friends

414
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,560
mainly because you forget it better be
my friend I now

415
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,450
are know everything about but we really
did get to be good friends and we

416
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,860
started talking about doing a project to
go

417
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,080
and Rick called me up and he said

418
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,669
I got a great idea you know when we meet
are you talking about

419
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,560
he says let's do a book where you
investigate

420
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,560
I try to stop you but we have to do it
differently since you were

421
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,679
and we tossed around we figured out and

422
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,930
if you know me and Rick this is even
gonna be funnier but even if you don't

423
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,080
we made a bet the bed is

424
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,220
Rick tries to hide I try to find

425
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,470
I mean actually find them you are at
this location right now we're take your

426
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:09,630
it or that sort of thing

427
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,080
if reckon stay hidden for 60 days

428
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,720
he wins knife to vote straight
democratic the next election

429
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,540
now

430
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,440
I'm trust me you would see on Google
News private investigator jobs or

431
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:31,020
bridge before before that happens

432
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,730
if Rex a setting for 60 days he works if
I can find him

433
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,460
ten times in the year

434
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,410
I want and yes vote straight Republican

435
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:47,390
are you would basically say novelists
jumps off bridge before that out

436
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:51,890
so we made this bet and Rick and this
really happened would put if you're into

437
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,700
this word on

438
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,230
free up right we finished we finished

439
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,410
gonna come back from bullies was the
church for food

440
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,700
the arts fighter known it all explained
that the second was

441
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,330
okay we finished in December right so

442
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:18,520
what happened is you when you try to
hide

443
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,910
he got offshore bank accounts or credit
cards and phone names

444
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,980
and state I mean it was his excuse for
staying with every girl he ever

445
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,530
a and but he got a fake placing started
delivering I mean

446
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,660
drop phones and everything I mean if you
really

447
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:40,040
tried and a corporate easily a couple
times

448
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,740
so you bout summer the bus wrote a book
about it by the way caught stealing your

449
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,500
own identity

450
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,140
there's a website up and you can
register for the book and will give you

451
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,120
autograph copies if you register

452
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,110
yes I am showing this and I've never
done this before but

453
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,580
it the if I studio to midnight I
couldn't cover all the stops on

454
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,580
yeah there's really a reason for the
book

455
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,919
and hear some for the bus cited by the
way we called a truce after the knife

456
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,070
bossed so

457
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:11,030
we can both vote our conscience is I can
are basically cancel each other out I'm

458
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,920
sure

459
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,960
so the truth is we should probably you
know

460
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,990
go out for dinner on election day not
even bother

461
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,970
and then I'll sneak out vote but not

462
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,140
so here's what I did: let me tell you
about somebody's bus

463
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,740
records records in water and he sells a
lot of his own books

464
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:35,410
he's got like a house full of books and
he services hammers on any services

465
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,660
people go to his website

466
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,930
so I set up a dummy email account I
started emailing him as a bookstore

467
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,950
owner

468
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:45,480
as an obnoxious British bookstore owner

469
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,270
but I i in each of these things I try to
be fair and I caught myself

470
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:52,820
rusty Shackleford and

471
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,950

00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,250
an eyesore going around interviewing all
the potential witnesses identified

762
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,520
and everybody talks to me and everybody
gives me more information and more

763
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,460
information for more information

764
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,010
his father gives me information his
brother gives me information

765
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:55,200
his mother gives me information

766
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,630
eventually I going to interview his
in-laws

767
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,730
and his in-laws fork

768
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,790
and is in los a

769
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:11,620
you know we have to do something about
this you've told us that

770
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,210
he's got another wife we for our
daughter was his wife

771
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,930
you've told us he's a convicted felon we
for he was the crown prince a force you

772
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,480
and by the way that was a that's not a
joke his own

773
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:26,530
ex-wife is on current wife is in-laws

774
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:31,570
all four he was really this Austrian

775
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,840
member for royalty it's amazing

776
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:42,720
the family complaints that the door the
door to complaints to the Prince

777
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:48,690
the Prince complaints to the FBI the FBI
comes and picks me up

778
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:51,910
not very nice I did my job

779
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:55,770
I did it within the law ultimately as
you all know

780
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:59,880
I was released pretty quickly factors
about to go to

781
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,880
China on a job at the judge said come
back his passport as I can be a fugitive

782
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:05,220
regina Rizzi

783
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:10,930
and the prosecutor or Noorani wonder if
you're

784
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,490
that's what happened water acquit
disappear for civil for informational

785
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,160
purposes if you're at all

786
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,270
why it took you two years to hear the
stork unless you're one other

787
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:22,600
the lucky few that went to Stevens
Institute

788
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,740
that's why but that's not why I put this
off the main reason I put this up guys

789
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,770
when I give the stork I like to say I'm
not going to tell you what to think

790
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:37,110
I'm gonna tell you what to think about

791
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:41,670
this is the exception I'm going to tell
you what that's like

792
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:46,220
there's a reason that in this country we
have a right to bear arms

793
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:50,220
that's because two hundred years ago
power came out of the barrel over going

794
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,280
to quote

795
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,830
a guy I don't normally call and the
government understood if we're gonna be

796
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:57,319
a free people

797
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,810
there has to be a counter balance
between the citizenry

798
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,220
and the government guns are not a
powerful anymore

799
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:10,210
information is filed if I as an
investigator

800
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:14,930
didn't have access to the information
which would have got me this guy's true

801
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:16,050
eternity

802
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:20,000
and true information and help me help
albert's and Toro

803
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,160
up its answer would have been real let
me tell you that in fact the government

804
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,640
is trying to close the

805
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,640
in ways you can't even conceive for your

806
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:33,089
access to information access the private
databases

807
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,480
it is 8 tidal wave of information being
removed

808
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:42,470
I mean some of it is really ridiculous
Richard Nixon in 1971

809
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:46,170
gave a speech a public speech on
television talking about how many

810
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,200
a ICBM's Russia house

811
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,440
four years ago that information was
reclassified

812
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:56,580
this is the honest to god truth why how

813
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,290
I don't know I don't care I am proud to
say I don't understand how the

814
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:04,110
government thanks

815
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:07,800
it's a it's a shame what happened with
the FBI I mean these people

816
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:12,650
were considered by me to be my
colleagues before the serpent

817
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:17,650
not so much now

818
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:21,820
but one thing the reason that I come
back here for every convention

819
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,260
and the reason that I feel comfortable
as an investigator

820
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,900
speaking to you guys not that sort of
crowd that I would normally lecture to

821
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,860
is because you are sure common interest
in keeping information open

822
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,740
keeping information free fighting
government affects the clothes

823
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,710
information

824
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:45,620
you know this is the name of the game
these guys these days you've got to be a

825
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,589
large

826
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:50,740
you've got to be vigilant you've got to
look at what I've spoken about today's

827
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,200
sec

828
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,800
how does this affect me what should we
do

829
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,890
I guarantee you that their is in this
audience

830
00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:02,810
this is not a spot the Fed contest kasar
pretty sure I know where they are in

831
00:53:02,810 --> 00:53:04,009
their

832
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:09,530
very very close to the stage the are
guaranteed to you and I'm not gonna

833
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,730
point about because

834
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,940
they are my colleagues even though they
are terribly

835
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,510
misguided politics I

836
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,950
there are federal law enforcement
officers here today monitoring the

837
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,790
speech

838
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:27,350
for going to report back inside Steve
robot put this up

839
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:31,040
your memo please remember to write

840
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,050
I would put up there what's in the open
public court file

841
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:39,000
gentleman II will also tell you that the
FBI

842
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,870
made a complaint about to the new york
state licensing authorities

843
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,850
Friday morning I assume to try to

844
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,850
prevent me from giving the speech

845
00:53:49,850 --> 00:53:53,620
a you know what

846
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,790
I don't tap dance in a minefield I stay
within the law

847
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:02,440
I do it I'm allowed to do 99.999 percent
of the time

848
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,090
I think I make the world a better place
sort of

849
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:13,090
up

850
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,410
why

851
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:19,259
1

852
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:24,710
your one very western and this is from
the paybacks a bitch the for

853
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,440
now remember that

854
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,619
wife that I told you about that he
abandoned thirteen years ago

855
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:37,339
Notre also for wife didn't know where to
find a room

856
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:43,078
too soon on other a public-spirited guy
I turned the information over to the

857
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:45,410
Oakland County Prosecutor's Office in
Michigan

858
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,500
there's no bench warrant out for I

859
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,740
sometime next week I will be going

860
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,920
unless I'm locked up as I leave here

861
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:00,000
I will be going I hope with the new york

862
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,220
NYPD Warren scored waiting for this to
be put into NCIC so anybody can act on

863
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:05,619

864
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:09,210

pulled out by

865
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,160

on him he's a bad man you'll notice

866
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:14,779
there's no warrant out on me so

867
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:18,089
presumably there are not that many other

868
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:22,140
haven't figured it out I

869
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:26,828
we are not going to happen yeah that's
one of my favorite quotes or SARS a pass

870
00:55:26,829 --> 00:55:27,250

okay let me tell you

879
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:05,190
I have these little false credentials

880
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:10,460
everyone gets one who asks a question
rick is giving out copies of geek mafia

881
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:13,650
and the best question the first question

882
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,250
that's an investigator naked too sure

883
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:21,380
so so please don't waste time

884
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,060
ask a good question are I'll start with
a quick question

885
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:28,589
you're talking about Google and the guy
in Florida yet search

886
00:56:28,589 --> 00:56:31,779
the yacht bullet wound to the chest the
right side of his chest search

887
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,660
and the detective recovered that you set
from a cash did you mean:

888
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:38,920
I just want to clarify did you me from a
browser cache on the client side on the

889
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,430
on the suspect I don't know I don't know
we had over

890
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:45,280
I don't know the answer I know it was
recovered from his computer

891
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,710
okay computer receives that was
recovered they did I don't even know

892
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,670
what I'm talking to its like the voice
of God

893
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,810
toward now but you know if they think
we've

894
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:58,359
this is God not thanks I

895
00:56:58,359 --> 00:57:02,690
I know it was recovered the guy's name
is Justin barber so

896
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:06,460
I'm sure with a minimal amount of
investigation you can you can find that

897
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:06,780
out

898
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,790
fine knew you were a give you a little
will probe the turkey virtual yeah

899
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:17,089

00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:23,420
this is benefits

916
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,820
I up

917
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,530
reducer licensed private investigator

918
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:37,210
very close call your mind wander the
best polygraph guys in the country

919
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:41,450
a I like to say he's the second-best
investigator the New York

920
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:46,490
New York City area know his is a
phenomenal investigator and anything

921
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:50,330
they're over there anything anything
that

922
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:54,330
anything that a you know I can answer

923
00:58:54,330 --> 00:59:00,299
reggie Rekha backtracking

924
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,460
for the Alzheimer's patients I'm

925
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:07,840
their say several times they're not
gonna know now

926
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,930
%ah are really sorry

927
00:59:11,930 --> 00:59:15,260
and all that so I've I'm really sorry
saying that

928
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:20,620
I i do think it's a good idea I mean
look the the the the privacy rights that

929
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:23,359
are appropriate for you and me for for

930
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,700
for in my case a partially competent
adult

931
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,390
I you know shouldn't apply to an
Alzheimer's patient

932
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:35,790
orchid what would you say is the
importance

933
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:39,820
up an online presence because originally
I thought that it's really important

934
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:44,250
have some presence online so it somebody
doesn't pretend that they're you

935
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:50,550
so wrecked this is a question for you
hello

936
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:53,730
a while I to I

937
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,490
I I think just go with it I think the
point is just be aware why I think

938
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,750
I my takeaway from my experience and and
my tech way

939
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:06,710
from even the first time I saw Steve's
talk is that I think it is important and

940
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:07,360
useful

941
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,630
in the example he cited as a good one to
have an online presence

942
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:15,290
just be smart about it be aware just go
into it this is how I live

943
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:18,580
now every moment of my life I just
assume that somebody's gonna find out

944
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,259
what I'm doing

945
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:24,810
lists and stuff like that I read hidden
track you don't

946
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:27,790
you don't get off the lists ABS how do
you get off less I don't think you do

947
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,320
get off the list your on the you

948
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:32,800
that the data doesn't get a race you
know and so

949
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,980
you just kinda live with it and that's
kinda crappy world we live in now but

950
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,330
that's my business with things

951
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:43,420
everybody should know is that anything
you do

952
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,390
he can communication you have whether
it's on the net on the phone

953
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:52,520
on his cell phone or eggs lets you write
that a tablet showing him

954
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:56,300
you have to assume that everybody in the
world

955
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:00,040
you can find this out and no but even if
it's in cryptid

956
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,150
well they do then who's gonna get ask

957
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:06,370
yes secret that at some point some read

958
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:11,350
at very true for so if you're sending
encrypted files yourself you might be

959
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:11,830
okay

960
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:18,259
are up you have the bad and the book

961
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:22,970
the bats was 25 cents to you month us

962
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:27,510
that's our twenty cents less him half

963
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,940
one question is the edges worth

964
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:34,720
good or buildings these days are asking
for your ID

965
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,570
and the scanned have all the information
right there so

966
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:42,070
how do you I get was an alternative way

967
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:46,140
to getting buildings with out giving
your driver's license and

968
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:49,560
every all the information I think yes

969
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,840
house how does it look at ways to avoid
having

970
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,920
you know like a bar that makes you swipe
your your card is only way to avoid the

971
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,070
stop drinking

972
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:01,760
stopped working I just normal buildings
do that

973
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,030
not quite passport that's a good one now

974
01:02:05,030 --> 01:02:07,900
they're gonna start running it's a good
one for the next six months or whatever

975
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,810
it's all of these buildings are carrots

976
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:15,509
it's a private place on this if they say
of getting

977
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:21,770
the concert you're not real at such a
crime

978
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:25,930
yet so with loop yeah that's right
thanks

979
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:28,640
so a lot of scary stuff great talk I
appreciate it I've been thinking about

980
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:29,970
this for a bit and

981
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:33,790
really thinking that is the asymmetrical
control this data that matters most so

982
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,920
two-parter how do you think these
dynamics change if you start tracking

983
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,100
all this information about yourself

984
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:42,500
and the coming on Big Brother and second
part how we get these tools into the

985
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,930
hands of journalists educators and
social scientists who really need to

986
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:48,080
understand them now

987
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,350
okay

988
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:55,600
I'm sure is a good question but it was
just

989
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,680
are little heart okay so what you are
talking about its I

990
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,820
guys it's probably a bad idea for us to
do this from

991
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:08,330
from two locations can can when you guys
just like take control of the question

992
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:11,900
your alright

993
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,050
real quick so how do how do these
dynamics change if you start keeping

994
01:03:16,050 --> 01:03:18,560
track of all at your own data yourself

995
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,000
and become your own big brother and how
do we get these kinds of tools into the

996
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,910
hands a

997
01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:25,930
journalists educators and social
scientists who could use them to do

998
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,450
better

999
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:30,920
then the governments and corporations I
the answer is if you keep track of your

1000
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,190
own data

1001
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:36,170
all it does is it lets you effectively
know how screwed you or

1002
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:36,960
I

1003
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,130
it it does not remove that data from
other people's access

1004
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:44,270
I i mean if you start being proactive in
the future

1005
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:47,720
what people ask if your social security
number you give it to them blindly

1006
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,079
they have no right to it when I
registered my phone in Texas

1007
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:55,319
there sry for my social security number
I refuse that there's a there's a

1008
01:03:55,319 --> 01:03:56,980
limited number of people

1009
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:01,010
up types of entities that have a right
to ask for your social security number

1010
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,050
for example

1011
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:05,430
it's not a question of being aware of
your information

1012
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:09,309
it's restricting forgets it to the bare
minimum but I think Steve

1013
01:04:09,309 --> 01:04:12,359
the second part is question is actually
cycling gear yeah I know

1014
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,170
that's why bring up because this is
right in line with your talking talking

1015
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,630
about

1016
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:19,190
using the same sort also a taste
yourself and

1017
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,290
and just keep making more people where

1018
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:25,849
especially journals and people like that
love the same sort of tools that are

1019
01:04:25,849 --> 01:04:28,920
available the drying abuse then this is
exactly what you're in favor of your

1020
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,020
ever have the information is going you
we've had this conversation many times

1021
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,280
that I so yeah

1022
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,059
and I've gotta tell you that's that's my
that's my crusade

1023
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:41,059
to get this information out to everyone
make people more aware

1024
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:44,140
keep the information free on Journal so
the bus that

1025
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,808
number one get journalists to go to hope
so they could

1026
01:04:47,809 --> 01:04:51,299
so they can actually attend seminars on
this but there are

1027
01:04:51,299 --> 01:04:54,809
i mean the the reporters Committee on
freedom and privacy puts this

1028
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:55,950
information out

1029
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,280
and and their workshops now I mean
journalists are really starting to get

1030
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:00,930
it out for

1031
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:04,960
yeah I think just from my experience are
with doing the research for the book and

1032
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:05,569
everything

1033
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,589
I and i really am firmly convinced that

1034
01:05:08,589 --> 01:05:12,599
there's no going backwards on it and so
I'm I'm definitely in the camp above

1035
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:15,799
make everybody aware how to get all this
and

1036
01:05:15,799 --> 01:05:19,359
and the ice if all that information is
gonna be out there

1037
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,700
then it shouldn't just be in the hands
of a few them

1038
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:26,500
information has been out there for years
now they want to put it back in the

1039
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:26,980
bottle

1040
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:32,730
privacy advocates wanna now restrict the
use is so security numbers

1041
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,890
but guess what if you have a guy
person's name and date of birth

1042
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:40,279
or phone number you get everything about
him anyway for only problem restricting

1043
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:43,530
so Security numbers is give you a
problem when people have to do

1044
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:45,170
background investigations or

1045
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:48,660
new lover I E I do

1046
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:52,200
Lori potential employees a new employee

1047
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,530
were anybody for that matter since your
new coach for the kids

1048
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:59,220
we have to have some they can be
identified the person

1049
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:02,400
as okay we got

1050
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,849
you know I'm no I'm getting the getting
a big corporate I

1051
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:10,339
to pull this off the stage so so three
more questions

1052
01:06:10,339 --> 01:06:13,610
%ah the

1053
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:17,650
because because between the three of us
we weigh like 100 for you

1054
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:21,720
nobody's properties focus of so is okay
seriously

1055
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,880
I three quick questions and I tell you
what

1056
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,980
I'll go outside the room anybody wants
it or 3 I'll stay there for an hour

1057
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:32,430
we're going to look at on the vendors
are even better

1058
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:35,470
you know what red rick has a Rick us a
table

1059
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,650
will go to the vendors area anybody
wants to talk to us we'll give you

1060
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:39,540
unlimited time

1061
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,370
got three more questions here a safe
hang out

1062
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:47,040
I do it galloping a question for you I'm

1063
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:54,040
considering especially since I've had on
14 experience with Ashley

1065

you want to go back down track on his
ex-girlfriend that's what they're saying

1066
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,470

1067
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:07,210
Steve opinion first make sure she
doesn't post to

1068
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:11,220
don't deter yeah a I

1069
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:15,610
look the truth there's the amount of
public information out there

1070
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,470
is extraordinary for for for something
like a potential date

1071
01:07:19,470 --> 01:07:23,880
your friends unfortunately I'm sorry to
say you don't need a private

1072
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,680
investigator

1073
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:28,260
look at our myspace page is looking for
a LinkedIn look at our

1074
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:31,640
look at her blog activity and you know
what

1075
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:35,080
see how for back it goes

1076
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,100
make sure she didn't create that
eternity a year ago

1077
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,540
just a little tip their next question

1078
01:07:42,540 --> 01:07:47,750
you're there

1079
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:52,000
your the Iowa House here

1080
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:59,000
are a PITA but go quick one question

1081
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:06,310
how do we protect ourselves from
tracking with Google and others are you

1082
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,420
don't because Google not you don't use
them

1083
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:17,700
Google not only amalgamate its me
tracking by Google or tracking when you

1084
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:20,200
use cool you know

1085
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,580
because not only is information that
you've contributed which I'm guessing is

1086
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:27,720
already endorsing you can't put the
genie back in the bottle

1087
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:32,280
not only is that they're but everything
that anybody else writes about you

1088
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:36,450
I i mean hence the title at the store
privacy is that get over

1089
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:41,010
really is you can't do it you can get
the genie back in the bottle

1090
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:44,430
once information is posted it is
therefore

1091
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:49,859
ever or a last question just

1092
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:54,410
are big

1093
01:08:54,410 --> 01:08:58,479
yes you keep repeating that that's
something you can find out about a

1094
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,220
person but it seems like

1095
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:04,310
a society that's what information about
person is much less

1096
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:07,890
damaging and so society has changed in a
way that

1097
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:11,980
finding out this information about a
person is not as valuable worries

1098
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:13,270
damaging to that person

1099
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:17,970
where do you live New York not damaging
in New York

1100
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:22,430
talk to the the to the nice educator
from Kansas

1101
01:09:22,430 --> 01:09:26,040
ask her ask her what the prevalent
attitude is in her community

1102
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:30,880
would be better society became a place
where was okay of course

1103
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,130
but here's what you're listening to

1104
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:38,799
a trick up his his at I've heard this
talk now yeah I heard this talk several

1105
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:39,290
times

1106
01:09:39,290 --> 01:09:42,450
and his point is trying to make an I
kinda hats or the same actually did the

1107
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:43,429
first time I heard

1108
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:46,630
his porn is trying to make is that it's
something that traditionally and still

1109
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:49,279
today most people want to keep private
and are not aware

1110
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:52,769
how they're so as an example but it it's
one that gets bukkaked charges

1111
01:09:52,770 --> 01:09:56,030
work but there's a radical left is like
out there was discrimination

1112
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:59,170
this discrimination just go on your data

1113
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:03,620
are you an african-american our UK

1114
01:10:03,620 --> 01:10:07,940
are you jewish are you a left-winger are
you are right corner

1115
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:11,010
if I look at your data I will find
something

1116
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:14,510
to dislike about you potential I what
i'm saying is

1117
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:17,990
you need a maybe quickly but

1118
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:22,710
what i'm saying is you need to be aware
that that information is out there

1119
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:26,310
the same way just your name and address
is out there

1120
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:33,310
alright thank you very much for this guy

1121
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:41,050

1122
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:46,690

1123
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:53,690
