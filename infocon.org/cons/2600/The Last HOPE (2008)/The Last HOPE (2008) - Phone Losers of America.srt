00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,600
some companies have been talking about
using on seven occasions since at least

316
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,740
the early nineties when I first heard
about it

317
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,970
but this is the first time I seen any
company actually use it

318
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:29,480
and it's a good idea in theory the
problems that actually removes a layer

319
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,350
security

320
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,779
not me I would need to get personal
information about wesley texas is

321
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,610

322
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,840

344
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,889
this by agent steel

345
00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:54,450
so you know but we got next

346
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,330
try to get try to get that CNBC on CNBC
clip for Ghana

347
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:03,029
nothing that we just have the idea year
okay he said the idea for

348
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:07,470
yeah again

349
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,510
I'm basically a basically what they're
talking about the the prank call that

350
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,429
that that

351
00:21:11,429 --> 00:21:15,590
that they're gonna be featuring I guess
on the on here we don't have the video

352
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,730
which is probably for the best because a
SN video sucks

353
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:23,139
heavily on air it's just CNBC you know
awake something I don't see every day

354
00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:24,129
anyway

355
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:27,260
so it's basically Brad looking at the

356
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,029
at the camera Lake deer in the
headlights you know just not very good

357
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:31,809
on TV

358
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:36,059
he's not you have very photogenic I I
wish you just play the videos you could

359
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:39,720
see brad's amazing impression yeah he
made was pretty good grade by its

360
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,419
principal is talking to unlock

361
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:44,950
yeah but basically what they're what
they're talking about is this a is this

362
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,149
Franco added to a Walmart

363
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:48,809
where basically move

364
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:51,899
a how can I explain this the

365
00:21:51,899 --> 00:21:55,720
they people call Walmart the the main
number Walmart and they get

366
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,990
night a customer service representative

and I you know they play they play a
couple the calls

369
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,370
from that and then bred discusses it and
again the guy girls and for being a

370
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,490
basically a and he covered terrace you

401
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:13,679
late 90s and I'm we just capitalists

where people can so that things

403
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:21,720
adonis and the list could I have looked

407
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,549
the store security to be able to take
that call whoever Dwight was that did

408
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:38,820
bass leaving yes I we just kinda drifted
from department to department in

409
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:43,039
pick up the phones as the calls came and
in recorded them from the store

410
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,070
we have another call somebody listening
books call initially for directions I

411
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,428

hear this

412
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:54,590

413

414
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,619

415
00:25:01,619 --> 00:25:06,720

417

get to the store

418
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:20,700
if this reminds me of some other morning
radio where they have a RvB prank

419
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,210
callers want to be favored

420
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,750
and choices for morning radio
entertainment

421
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,450
however bad there is also legal

422
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,250
and certainly ethical issues associated
with the

423
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,169
either destroying property or from im
we're presuming to be an employee when

424
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:38,039
you are not

425
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:43,109
where is the line between prank a.m. the
law and we just

426
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,490
kinda often think about that we're just
going two hundred

427
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:49,659
time to time we get all this in the mid
90's and had

428
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:53,490
how did you take over the overhead
paging system this is how we discovered

429
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:54,080
the

430
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,939
paging code that they use to get on the
paging system we called in from the

431
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,480
outside and ask them to transfer as to
that extension

432
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,359
and that put us on the overhead paging
and we're able stay on for hours just

433
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,789
telling jokes and seanangs imitating and
wanted to say on the air

434
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:13,779
now how much of this was for fun

435
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:17,139
and how much of this is because you have
a a particular

436
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:21,809
I'm issue with Walmart I'm

437
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,100
at same or less it's pretty much of a
fine if thats

438
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,649
I don't have anything personal against
wal-mart I don't like them too much

439
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:29,379
better

440
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,509

441
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:36,289
so what are those big you did because it
was there to do we we called Walmart an

442
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,220
awsome for comment they were not
familiar

443
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,840
I'm with your activities and so they
didn't give us a comment although I

444
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,450
imagine

445
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,389

televisions tonight Brad a pleasure to

447
00:26:47,389 --> 00:26:52,799
thank you well in basically that's a
that's how it went down girl unlike a

448
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,320
like a if I can terrorist or something
and

449
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,320
we weren't in the store obviously I

450
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:03,009
basically what we did it was a it was
all social engineering we did nothing on

451
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:04,200
site

452
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,070
a basically we do we'll call we'll call
customer service line

453
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,019
for business business line and say hi
this is the manager you know it the

454
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:17,139
Walmart in Gainesville or something do
in Florida anything

455
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:20,710
and a you know air phones aren't working
or not getting any calls into getting

456
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,710
any calls out

457
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,899
we need to have calls coming in to get
them forwarded to maybe like a home

458
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,740
office is some kind

459
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:31,039
it's a yes sure you know them you know
that as I get the manager's name

460
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,590
the district managers name is usually
good to have both those things

461
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:40,599
I and then jizzster there was a okay
will give us about 50 minutes they call

462
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:44,599
they would call you you know it the
whatever number you did what we did is

463
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,799
we set it up to a a conferences

464
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,990
teleconference that would terminate
silently

465
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,330
so it would just be me and him on the
line there we hear the click

466
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,990
every new customers online and then we
can just talk to them

467
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:00,019
so you know there's nothing on site it
was nothing like that

468
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:03,109
so yeah

469
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:06,539
and it is a hero I notice that we're
just talking about you so yeah

470
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:10,450
now misgiving yes okay

471
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,799
I think so I'm saying yeah yeah I just
while so it

472
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,759
you guys know that as you can tell by
his vice president very educated

473
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:20,349
intelligent very

474
00:28:20,349 --> 00:28:24,418
smart man very calm that's them is
listening to this is me

475
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:28,399
yeah yeah by the way he says it as much
as he says he loves you on thank you for

476
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:31,049
coming to this panel is really great

477
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,769
then he said some really disgusting
things that when I can repeat

478
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:37,980
cement all your moms in a so it's going
back to

479
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,450
such as an a-hole going back to people
people that you can pull pranks on

480
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,750
from I thought members have this lovely
subculture we have

481
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,619
from we've we've always found targets
for our vitriolic I like Walmart or

482
00:28:51,619 --> 00:28:57,659
you know movie theaters or you know you
know God or whatever but the

483
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,139
he's really something to bring but I'm

484
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,500
you know the another another another
occasional target

485
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,169
and I want I won't say this is a regular
thing but it's a fun when it works out

486
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,340
is I'm love you so a we we decided to

487
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,950
I'm we became kind of you can kind of
known for putting out that tutorials for

488
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:18,190
various things and Dom

489
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,299
just that just for the sheer hell amid
we decided to put together a tutorial

490
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:26,220
that did not work and um we might get up
and decided to

491
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,669
basically see who had the who would fall
for that so I'm

492
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:36,509
week she shouldn't should be for say
that before all this happened hard

493
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,629
mmm feel right now gotta keep going yeah

494
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:43,230
that before all this happened we had
there is a video there was put around

495
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,019
over

496
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:47,820
love a bread and and his friend Raj 05 I
A

497
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,000
be going to a Taco Bell and attempting
to order food and then for some reason

498
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,919
using modified ham radio equipment

499
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,700
and bad they were able to then overpower
the

500
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,149
in the Taco Bell radio receiver in

501
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:06,990
you know speak on the on the speaker box
which made so yeah you might have seen

502
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,609
it on YouTube with a bunch a comment
saying oh god there's no fuckin way they

503
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:13,090
could do this what a fuckin lie it's
photoshopped

504
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:16,169
things like that you know saudi families
pixels

505
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:20,519
it's like a I seen these before yeah I
can see the pixelation so

506
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,450
basically that's what's been going on
with it had been around for about three

507
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,359
years it may be YouTube rounds about
sixteen times in you know sixteen people

508
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,679
saying look kinda radio can I do this

509
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,320
I april fools bread made this retreat me
this video so

510
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,599
press play now now press play press it

511
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:41,649
I summer but just I love choco

512
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,099
Tahoe is a humble

513
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:51,889
rules of my jump on Google money-maker
nice huh

514
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,070
want to

515
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,939
done

516
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,240
nice Ochoa back in 2003 we need this
video that showed us screwing with an

517
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
attack upon striking frequencies

518
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,580
after we done did nothing with them for
a few weeks we decided to go through the

519
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,929
drive to ourselves

520
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:13,600
with the camera and family man and his
reaction last modified and I so tech

521
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,750
messed with my order here

522
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,860
and

523
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:21,660
God

524
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,179
per share like embed has been well spent
it on Facebook

525
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,370
dig I don't you want to come and
separate sites

526
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,840
and it's caused a pretty constant flow
you know to me

527
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,280
a pass-first millions of people asking
me how to do it

528
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,590
service manuals and show you how to even
eat a proper

529
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:44,510
frequencies are pretty much done a fast
food joint in your town

530
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:50,220
don't you come here and talk to me like
that why

531
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,750
got some but heck yeah okay

532
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,830
guy

533
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:02,980
good you're bound to find something as
Cartier cvx.n

534
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,769
and that's what we used to take on the
topic of frequencies the problem with

535
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,809
using AC is the price

536
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:11,879
the cheapest I could find one is
probably two hundred and fifty dollars

537
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,220
then you have to modify it

538
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,429
than most people just aren't comfortable
opening up a two hundred fifty dollar

539
00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:21,450
piece of equipment some ushering in our
county parade

540
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:24,830
a penis to get started this you only
need two things:

541
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:29,519
land is a CB radio it has to be attended
a CB radio that has beautiful number

542
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,340
display on it

543
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:36,019
the second thing and is called a 6.55 36
magnets custom

544
00:32:36,019 --> 00:32:39,500
I don't know what happened to my husband

545
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,130
the CBN radio pull out the existing cost
one-sided

546
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:47,159
all possible CB radios use the same
frequency of course the inside

547
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:54,159
which is a 1.73 magnets custom replaced
acosta with are 6.5 536 make its crystal

548
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:58,090
replacing the crystal inside will
actually triple the frequencies

549
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,750
I just happens the policy but he was and
remains the drive to restaurants

550
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,600
broadcast on

551
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,779
reverses the polarity to Tennessee
should be

552
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:09,279
thought someone might have something in
mind into place got

553
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,190
12 probably less than 10 bucks before

554
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:18,309
spot staff spiner heat

555
00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:22,070
you should be able to find one man from
the 50 or 60 bucks come to

556
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:29,070
when investment Kinko's is good to cost
about 6.55 36 minutes in slightly more

557
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,480
complicated

558
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,500
which one are you can buy these crystals
from so you have to take

559
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,460
does a defense that uses them already I
believe you several has twice as good

560
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,929
use these kind of crystals

561
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:43,240
most common one even funny and he's a
toaster

562
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,769
from national tests were manufactured
after the nineteen eighties will happen

563
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:48,220
in his group's inside them

564
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:52,559
attached to pass through super you can
assign an apparent as you should

565
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:56,289
easily be able to plan out there
fitzpatrick I'm going to be using a

566
00:33:56,289 --> 00:33:57,840
walkie-talkie CB radio

567
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,029
it's a realistic TRC to know something
from your site

568
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:04,690
to spent the crystal lattice

569
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,810
first thing on particular escape
clinton's to unprofor

570
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:13,369
if you tryin to green retired

571
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:17,030
summed it up a bit got to escape

572
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,030
just come from you speech since taking
them out

573
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,080
perhaps griping and types of possible
before

574
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,668
picking up a pair of with what my first
rehab

575
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:32,040
posters manufactured after the nineteen
eighties had this crystal inside them

576
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,609
the used as a safety precaution and the
cantata concealed heating coils inside

577
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,460
the test

578
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,859
sustenance crystals and he has plane for
Houston Chronicle such as I

579
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:46,489
geyser a heater UConn and even in your
electric stove

580
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:51,790
much to type of you should be able see a
circuit board inside

581
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,449
good

582
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:02,450
on soccer body preparing your crystal
good

583
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,660
measures to keep

584
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,310
connections to meet the cost of perhaps

585
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:16,220
very very basic stuff people

586
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,550
attest to my stomach without the
crystalline solid

587
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:24,119
but it's not a month instead of thinking
about us

588
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:27,770
the federal taking a CB radio

589
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,670
should be just as easy as taking apart
the toaster mysteries and publication of

590
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,099
inside you'll see a circuit board its

591
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,000
because the on-site look exactly like
the custom printable toaster

592
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,109
the only difference is the ones on Obama
frequency

593
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:49,830
most apostles just plugged into a socket
something happy Easter Sunday 1921 in

594
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:53,770
as you can see it. AC 2007 it was
plugged into a socket right next to the

595
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:54,830
transmit button

596
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:01,830
so anytime this man outs Greg Nickels
terrain

597
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:07,869
but the lady does not make a difference
from this open and what's really plugged

598
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:08,510
in

599
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,210
after that's done in December your CB
radio and you're ready to start having

600
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,760
fun

601
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,380
afternoon sleeping with you smart people
to conceive the channels anymore

602
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,800
1727 group range

603
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,020
by replacing the customer insight into
CB radio you've actually tried to bring

604
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,410
your CDs capable

605
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:33,020
ever seen and transmitting on I just so
happens that 6.55 369 it's not something

606
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,630
he needs to be able to listen in top two
tries to frequencies

607
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,790
once you find us to stop he popped

608
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:46,009
on certain post I put into a chance and
to keep on talking

609
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:50,780
16 question it's as easy as pressing the
tab key

610
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,980
in saying anything you want to them
censure CB radio several times not

611
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,550
problem employees headsets the customer
should only be able to hear you

612
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,660
you're trapped between and not the
employee inside

613
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,810
and good

614
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:11,980
and good

615
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,849
and you

616
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:14,870
like it

617
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:21,870
