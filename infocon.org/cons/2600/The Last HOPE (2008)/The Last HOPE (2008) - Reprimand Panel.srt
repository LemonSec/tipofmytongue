thank you for and

94
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,320
I'm trying to get my way he said no
museum

95
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
we had to leave with

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,560
threats forms to its we meeting rooms so

97
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,110
my we've got on the bus for were

98
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,580
the minimums for oh one other thing that
some

99
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,310
humans alley is allow the windows were
boarded up

100
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,250
but they were painted with the I so they
had a black curtain with the

101
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,960
draw string on them and these like a
year ninety percent when those are

102
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
painted this way

103
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,850
and um so I get none of us can figure
out what happened

104
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:22,170
and that our area because it got by now
but the arm

105
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,130
I but the water reservoir wants that on

106
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:32,159
worship near watershed and them and so
they could most an area

107
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,400
yet nothing was like everything was
untouched

108
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,380
so does not like so we just that got up
and left but we couldn't find any

109
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:44,030
logical explanation for why some
people's leave

110
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,740
and the houses for the borders of and I
just put up a

111
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,850
have those things mean that in the
Windows like that side

112
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,940
too much of an effort for something so
simple

113
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,040
was an accident that happen maybe some
gas plant

114
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,910
people would've come back eventually so
it seems like it was like a little like

115
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,740
leave now and never come back to
everything but logically nothing

116
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,190
make sense in that and that situation

117
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,430
you also ahead I'm this

118

gold

591
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:51,690
some lobby lead

592
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:54,269
I'm

593
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:59,180
and K

594
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,379
guys

595
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,100
this morn I'll miss the said

596
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:10,140
that the not yet

597
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:13,390
a hotel is now making money over now

598
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,290
has been hit hard by the recession
because I achieving

599
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:21,730
bear stearns I'll the Sun it's also
chief Morgan for Taunton

600
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,730
I I think thirty million that dollars
the

601
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,690
Visteon's measures were passed because
bear stearns has a building

602
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,500
worth over a billion dollars I think in
Manhattan something

603
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,130
sup so on what happens as a

604
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:39,580
JP Morgan by Bear Stearns for the
building basically

605
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,120
to navigate the building they don't need
to buy a submissive a note

606
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,490
this land 780 has no by anymore

607
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,440
the sort going to demolish nom sensation
and move it somewhere else

608
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,670
and I don't understand how to get
permission the city's do that in the

609
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,540
first place

610
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:00,560
because he had a subway at the end
affect periods a goddamn

611
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,590
Jersey Transit and you have up why are

612
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,240
yet by overrode such a move all that

613
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,650
to the gym for the city would require
Tom and CEO

614
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,370
would be impossible my view so I good

615
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,410
here your

616
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,710
so bananas crazy but at least now the
hopefully they won't

617
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:25,910
demolishing buttino you can't force an
insane person to act scenes

618
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:29,140
would well actually I know the future

619
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,620
his room things on Martin year

620
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,930
but as always wanted with them you know

621
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,450
to spoon with hackers who's the worst
grueling

622
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,720
there's going to be a much no no I'm

623
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,890
to be more than just a poem no when
people hitting at 5am

624
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:54,670
you

625
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,490
goes

626
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:01,300
your my just fine event hmm hmm hmm

627
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,810
but he's not having an easy time is to
have a Manhattan

628
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:10,650
up said its Manhattan the pricing for
the conference face

629
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,910
is insane so I this is it because those
holes

630
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,240
as older and arm yes

631
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,610
the the space is cheaper for them so
that

632
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,230
but I gets demolished of the lot up will
become I'll

633
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,690
will be a lot more expensive as a whole
to host home which

634
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:31,760
would mean the entrance fee will be is
be more expensive

635
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,180
we won't have as much space am hopeless
rob has grown constantly so

636
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,529
feature hopes need actual space

637
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,280
sick and Frank it down so at this if you
have like a

638
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,570
you know thats shove the venue you'll
either need to get

639
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:52,180
either charge people like athlete like
such book on charges which is insane

640
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:52,810
prices

641
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,860
now or basically up

642
00:41:55,860 --> 00:42:02,860
move in at a Manhattan a.m.

643
