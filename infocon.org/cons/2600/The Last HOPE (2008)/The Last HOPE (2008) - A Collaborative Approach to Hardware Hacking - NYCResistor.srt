1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,210
so you don't get to see what you she
acted out

2
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,910
yes what's happening here authors 200
feet of surgical tubing and me on a

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:08,860
hovercraft

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,280
and I enjoyed that they are put it up on
our website

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,620
and and you'll see something really
unhappy happen

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,100
I'm so then I'll art

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,539
the thing called hackers on a plane
what's happened which was probably

8
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:26,710
a really defining event for space in
that a

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,740
George Peter and I went on this thing we
went to fifty

10
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,190
we went to Def Con in on the CCC which
is a camp it happens every four years

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,729
and those things 20 everywhere and

12
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,039
a everyone in the store all these
hackers spaces

13
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,399
and got really inspired me so that
presentation you just saw

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,920
a year ago in rc4 and

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,019
georgian I afterwards recovered many
have been traveling around for like two

16
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:54,879
weeks together and look so where you
from his like New York I might come from

17
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,699
New York to

18
00:00:55,699 --> 00:00:59,049
which produce means that your careless
both

19
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:02,799
occurring in names we spent four hours
committee for the name and then I woke

20
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,659
up in a min

21
00:01:03,659 --> 00:01:08,070
put together although like a so here we
are watching their presentation with

22
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,440
with Jensen pylon and

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,270
not broken there you go

24
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,110
we're all really excited about this and

25
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:24,260
then we got all the arm produce like
their mailing lists all that stuff right

26
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,830
there

27
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,300
we came to its going automatically came
back to NYC

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:34,230
who've stop there and then we can all
meet up just the three of us

29
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,430
and we started meeting just pulling
people together

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,430
read that would be good from people and
we met kinda

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,930
interesting places and the

32
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,210
rooftops and such and then

33
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,580
they are incorporated in what we started
doing is um

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,070
recovery later actually researcher in
microcontroller study groups are invited

35
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,520
people to come and bring projects and a
show-and-tell San

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,729
that was really fun arms the project
became

37
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,250
like this this is Dave's are you also
still project which is i

38
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,440
awesome and the neck taught this call

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,669
like how to use a little light to make
things like

40
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,010
reproductions of things so is a general
like talking into chatting and becoming

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,679
friends

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,680
and we decided that we need to obtain a
space yeah

43
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:29,049
Bryce right there writer okay and Dave a

44
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:33,200
so after we ever got to go inside to get
a space we

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,889
put together a budget about two thousand
dollars and and Senate some basic

46
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:38,680
criteria

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,980
reasonably safe neighborhood you know
certain a spacer mushrooms

48
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,798
want to have a kitchen and stuff so that
showers we could have guessed that

49
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,900
done actually end up working out but
those were because you're looking for

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,219
we try to you know talk to friends
people we knew

51
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,950
who who were doing similar things like a
what sets basin

52
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,359
williamsburg artists to third

53
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:07,040
Third Ward yes we talk to those guys
they handle a on a good space is the

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,879
show us in

55
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:11,939
visited Craigslist and brokers were
where the main sources and

56
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:16,279
so we divided up into teams maybe three
or four people looking at a few

57
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,840
different neighborhoods are each team
looking at an individual neighborhood

58
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,769
with two three or four neighborhoods and

59
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,400
you can form that out and got together
as a big reported a few spaces

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,529
we can it started out with this somebody
made this nice cat diagram

61
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:32,799
what we were looking for ideally can
remain space and

62
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,559
little work areas on the side looked a
lot of places

63
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:41,510
all downtown Brooklyn essentially Park
Slope and how many guys are from New

64
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:42,129
York but

65
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:45,700
those were kinda but lot of us live
there and that was reasonable budget

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,180
wise

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,799
compared to Manhattan and can we ended
up with was

68
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,419
doesn't look that much like the original
can diagram but it's a big

69
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,739
open kind of industrial commercial space
it's about a thousand square feet

70
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,599
as you can see it can actually fit quite
a lot of people this is

71
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,069
these pictures are mostly early on the
one down the bottom right is kinda want

72
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:07,680
it more looks like now that's a

73
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,090
now that it's four stuff but it's really
great space

74
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,969
you get these big were tables and there
you have classes you can have these big

75
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:15,579
meetings

76
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,630
so i think im worked out really well
who's next

77
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,170
up next are so they may decide to move
in and these are just a bunch of

78
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,790
pictures overs making stuff

79
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,490
moving in yea

80
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,810
and then

81
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,660
next up is Kelly

82
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,820
so the biggest problem but we had early
on with the space month based up

83
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,849
a big problem is organization and the
fact they got really made me really fast

84
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,010
um so there's a couple things we did

85
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,680
kinda combat the clutter and there's
nothing more infuriating

86
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,270
been having good for the morning and
knowing that somewhere in the space is

87
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,700
exactly the key when you need

88
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,599
and in wanna lick seven different bags
and you never to find it

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,940
a so Alicia quick to put this together
his and tipping over right now

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,350
up went crazy and got containers

91
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,320
and labels for everything and what we
did was born is reading but was put in

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,070
the boxes

93
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,320
and then labeled it the label so the
most important part a

94
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,599
we also give everyone their own space a
shelf with their name on it you know who

95
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,610
shot that was and the public shelf

96
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,660
that was the share shelf so that
everyone knew that these are the things

97
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,260
that you can take whatever you want
these we think you should ask someone

98
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:27,760
for

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,460
and these are things you should never
take a stand yours

100
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,650
so drawers buckets been labels just

101
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,250
anything you can do to denote what stuff
is and then magically

102
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,890
people start to use it and follow it and
then you can actually find things

103
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,159
am it takes a little bit effort it's
something that's kinda ongoing thing you

104
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,490
have to do it's not magic

105
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,950
hi you know once might have to say okay
its organization day we're gonna

106
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:53,159
take that big but in a weird stuff in
actually put it where it belongs I'm but

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,160
once you do that it makes you space so
much more usable

108
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,379
just

109
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:11,559
okay sign a talk to this after rare

110
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:15,349
and talk to the slide deck and haven't
seen in like a month so you

111
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:18,878
bear with me some talk about some things
that happen and NYC resistor

112
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,080
I'm one of things that we do it because
called

113
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,240
exploitation cinema night this happens a
its sunday it's sort of like a good way

114
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,009
to end the weekend hang out

115
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,789
comfy got the most creative way to make
popcorn using a Jacobs ladder whatever

116
00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:32,610
else you can find

117
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,719
and basically you know revel in sum up
the

118
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:40,469
finer slashed cheesy movies that have
come out

119
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:43,550
I'm especially highlighting are
exploiting our culture

120
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,870
and so if you have been doing this for a
couple months

121
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,430
and gone through quite a lot of the
usual suspects

122
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,669
I'm and avoided some of the other ones I
think

123
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,180
a swordfish was vetoed a long time ago
and

124
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,439
although it's you know it's sitting on
the hard drive have to

125
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,830
you know have to admit it's on I so
basically we do they have a projector

126
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,300
laptop hard drive for movies all

127
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,499
eclipse legal backups love ones for
which you'll have a hard copy

128
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,779
placed in the vault and the collective
NYC resistor box

129
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:19,360
I'm please don't come after us

130
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,419
up the another thing is I started

131
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,308
that I call security research Fight Club
where about to break the first rule

132
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:30,740
rules a security Fight Club

133
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,909
first robots keep my club you not talk
about to get to be searched by club

134
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,998
hopes %uh sorry a second rule

135
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,599
apparently do not talk about was
presented at ski resort reichl

136
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,990
I'm basically the idea is

137
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,800
this is something we can presents like
sorta law ideas and so you wanna make

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,809
sure that they can kind of be about it
these are people before

139
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:56,979
I got going public with them I'm speed
me as I had a long history of people

140
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:57,558
basically

141
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:01,110
taking so its own else is none saying
it's theirs and so you have a lot of

142
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,289
attention to that sell

143
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,438
I'm can have some ground rules like that

144
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,289
I their rule song says stop

145
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,550
or goes limp AK falls asleep it here
presentation is boring and it's over

146
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:19,199
I

147
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,889
I'm not gonna repeat that I

148
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:26,449
and to only one person to a presentation
money after

149
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,089
if be able to hold your own I one
position one presentation at a time

150
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,729
and no vendors no pitches no company
name

151
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,880
snow any crap like that

152
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,490
presentation last 20 minutes and most
importantly

153
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,680
it's your first night skin research by
club you have to present this is

154
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,800
unavoidable basically the idea is
everyone has to be a contributing member

155
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,079
and so you have to be able to teach
other people something interesting

156
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,079
and so I basically had to get back to
you

157
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,399
discovering something teaching other
teaching your friends

158
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,589
you can to keep the ideas flowing so
that we all we also hope that that kind

159
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,260
of raise the bar a little bit sets like

160
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,510
here again when impress people would
show up have prepared least something

161
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,930
tech I find interest

162
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,350
interesting things how to define define
interesting

163
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,319
if things are fine but appeared it's the
people who were there you know

164
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,819
if if I miss you is not cool enough

165
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,920
here if the fall if we fall asleep

166
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,139
you know it's not interesting act

167
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:38,250
I think it's just east I am just some

168
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,910
um so what are the ways that we up from
the space

169
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,920
beside membership dues is every once in
a while we throw the party

170
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,920
I'm so that's a lot of fun we like the
parties to have themes one worrisome

171
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,139
parties was the blinky blinky blinky
party

172
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,480
and one upcoming parties are having is
the are the game party

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,130
and so what we're gonna be doing is
inviting people who want to show off

174
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:02,459
video games as art typeof demonstrations

175
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,279
gonna set up a whole buncha really cool
looking stuff in the space

176
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,399
and then we're gonna get a bunch a beer
and have people over and

177
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,610
he will pay a pretty hefty but you know
worthwhile entrance fee and that will

178
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,800
help keep the space going

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,990
so summers some other things are going
to be showing off

180
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,389
are one is closer to I am and if you've
been by our

181
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:25,579
our space our spot and the hackerspace
village messiness

182
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:30,089
so it's a physics simulator with some
genetic algorithm tools

183
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,529
so these basically these little robots
evolve right there on the screen

184
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,709
and it's pretty cool to watch them do
stuff

185
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:39,829
um the version that were showing up here

186
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:43,600
is is a very early version and the
version will be showing up at this party

187
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,630
will allow you a greater level of
interactivity

188
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,610
you be able to pick parents and train a
little robots and have them compete

189
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:51,390
against each other

190
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,689
should should be a lot of fun and then

191
00:10:54,689 --> 00:10:57,630
another thing that will be showing up
amongst a lot of other things but

192
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,250
anything

193
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,709
for showing me showing up is some
gameplay demo stuff so

194
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:06,410
basically we've been out several some of
us have been hacking on Gameboy Advance

195
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,290
code

196
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,620
making neat little things on which
happens the because a

197
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,429
happens to be because I taught a class
on Game Boy Advance development recently

198
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:20,420
so everyone's all excited so there
should be a lot of game was tough to

199
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,529
that's it you me

200
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,750
hi I'm Zack and a 10

201
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,829
the slogan so then my sister from the
star has been to

202
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:35,339
make learn and share and so

203
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,079
a after we make things character when we
make things we learned how to do them

204
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,640
and then at then we like to share what
we've learned with other people

205
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,459
on and sell one other ways you can do
this cast and raise to teach classes

206
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,120
other classes are nice because you know
we're in New York and

207
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,730
a rental costs are like extreme like
ripping my two grams for

208
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,799
a tiny thousand-square-foot room and %uh
so by teaching classes allows us to

209
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,640
bring in money but also given our show
other people so

210
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,040
if you the different classes with tight
like we kelli tyler PHP class

211
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,279
on add-on and Raffi on some guys teacher

212
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,899
an LED matrix class which you know if
you come over by our hackerspace village

213
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:21,339
area and I we have all sorts of LED
matrices and

214
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:26,209
a pretty fun to make arm Rafael teaches
surface mount soldering class

215
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:29,230
so you can learn how to several other

216
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,500
time will parts on boards like this

217
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,670
IIT 10 introduction Eagle class so if
you want to learn how to actually make

218
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,640
the PCB

219
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,910
sir you make your own board it's kinda
nice

220
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,439
on and if you're in Essen and sign up
for classes

221
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,890
you can just come up this tiny screen
here or the projector

222
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,939
and will sign you up I

223
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,429
actually on our website NYC resistor dot
com there's a

224
00:12:54,429 --> 00:12:58,439
does the header so

225
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:03,250
come and learn and fill your brand's

226
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:07,459
and Pat I also liked enough not seen the
sides in like two months so

227
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:11,480
forgive me if I'm rusty but I I think
the transition here is that like

228
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,610
between sharing our knowledge in our
resources in the kinda get here

229
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,100
rate greater so

230
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,769
we gotta have two forms and stuff at the
space physical an imaginary

231
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,540
and so physical stuff um is kinda like

232
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,000
you know whatever are Joe Press are NYC
resistor toothbrush

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,120
and that sandwich in the refrigerator
things like that

234
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,689
so those things are pretty easy to share
because you guys probably all have

235
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:38,480
roommates

236
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,589
it's the same thing is Shane a
toothbrush to remain or anybody else

237
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,620
people do it so yeah is never a problem

238
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,620
finding ways to share these kinds of
resources and then we have the imaginary

239
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,189
objects so those are a little bit more
difficult

240
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:57,540
and so I'm kinda like what you know is
talking about

241
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,699
we have to have this culture of like you
can come and share ideas and not worry

242
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:01,639
about people

243
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,149
yes the IM and so like that's kinda
something we have in the formalized but

244
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:06,829
it's like

245
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,399
something that kinda this come
organically because I've you know just

246
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,559
the culture everybody

247
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,649
you know here and so that's kinda
important to us and I think important

248
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,809
in an environment like this that you
have to make sure that you

249
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:21,000
protect people's ideas and you down you
know have

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,040
you wouldn't steal somebody's sandwich
in refrigerator so

251
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,889
don't steal their Smurf for their black
box or whatever

252
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,740
um so then the physical stuff like I
said before it's pretty easy

253
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,980
you know if you need the drill press and
I was using it you go and use it

254
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,130
and you know we want to make sure that
there's not like one dude like Zac

255
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,589
always using the Joe Press

256
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:42,939
so you know you gotta make sure to
balance those resources just like

257
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:46,189
you would any other physical resource
and like I said about the imaginary

258
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:46,880
things

259
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,750
you can see I didn't see these lights
cuz I talked about this earlier but we

260
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,880
basically have this

261
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,559
this on you know that this is kinda I
wrote the slides

262
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,620
as like a description of our culture not
necessarily like we decide decided on

263
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,020
these

264
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,640
and our culture grew out of that and so
that's kind of important

265
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,600
thing to know um so we just make sure
that it's very open like you don't have

266
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,669
to worry about

267
00:15:07,669 --> 00:15:11,400
hiding your ideas and then you know its
trust that the you not gonna steal

268
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:18,400
anything you're gonna proper the tribute
people who helped you

269
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,949
Hirose

270
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,200
a I'm a sociology PhD student cuny

271
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,860
right now and I'm also number ever
sister um stuff the

272
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,050
I do a includes a sir

273
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,269
everything to do with textiles some
things to do with sex and what I learned

274
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,949
resistor a is how to include electronics
and also

275
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:44,810
be a physical computing kinda aspect to
the craft

276
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:48,279
things the I'm previously been is in arm

277
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,889
when I say that I'm a sociologist it's
not the I'm inner person from the

278
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:52,569
outside

279
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,230
coming into report back about the geeks
and freaks

280
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,610
but instead is me as a geek going in San
Agent Provocateur

281
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,560
into academia sir that our wonderful
ideas about how to self-organize

282
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,579
and our culture works can be shared with

283
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:13,440
a more academic our mindset um

284
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,040
modern sociology have developed a min
nineteenth century

285
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,490
as a way to respond to order to describe
what was going on

286
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,630
a as people were moving to cities and
urbanizing and also industrializing

287
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,009
what's been happening at the and the
20th century and beginning and 21st

288
00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:34,519
is the humans organizing in a different
way which is using the Internet

289
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,839
arm and says he only has really
responded to that

290
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,829
arming and in fact say that you

291
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:44,839
taking part in virtual communities and
they always put the quotes in

292
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:48,769
or the second wave their hands when they
talk about the Internet um

293
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,550
but that's the place where we all live
it needs to be talked about um

294
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,170
the I am additional a part that is

295
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,430
that the current fought in sociology

296
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,150
is that especially in america um we're
all losing touch with each other we're

297
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,069
not part of community is we're

298
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,490
bowling alone as Robert Putnam call that
arm

299
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,579
but that's not happening in the world I
within

300
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,149
we're all here to cart France we're all
sharing a space together working on

301
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,280
projects together

302
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,220
and as you've heard I'm all the other
members of the group A we have a lot of

303
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,809
thought to how that culture works

304
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,339
and how we're going to present it to the
world

305
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,620
we create media we also I'll to sure

306
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,590
taken back the means production that's
what I mean when I say the

307
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,240
we're gonna have a revolution um you
know marks explain to us

308
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,690
in the nineteenth century the capitalism
was a centralizing have resources

309
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,120
arm and that I'll it but took the means
of production

310
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,260
away from the people and put it with the
corporation's

311
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,629
arm where the people who take back the
means of production

312
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,799
arm and a to recall

313
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,629
I'll for Baltimore reilly he was quoting
william gibson et

314
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,230
I don't revolutions already here it's
just not widely distributed

315
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,559
arm and to go back one I'm and i also
think that hackers and key to the people

316
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,500
who can make

317
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,010
some parts of capitalism and especially
summer to globalism

318
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,340
good for all of us and we continue to do
so

319
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,918
hi

320
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,590
I think so

321
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,850
I work at the new york times during the
day in the research involving group and

322
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,260
at night I put on this really cool
outfit morning right now

323
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,480
add and I go to the hackerspace so
itself my talk is really about

324
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,669
you know if an LED blinks in the world
know is I see is it really blinking

325
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:48,040
okay so so I think we do is we we
document everything before after and

326
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,129
during and we put it

327
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,860
on our site and so you can go to up to
the blog which is NYC resistor dot com

328
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,510
and and we we document everything that
we're working on pretty much we also

329
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,400
document things that

330
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,840
other people working on the community so
this is an just a a project that Adam

331
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,449
was working on

332
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,730
which was bar but which was a at robot
that got you drunk

333
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,909
but end up getting drunk itself is
stopped working I'm

334
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:14,179
this was a this is just that I'm exact
as he's really cool videos where he does

335
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:14,520
these

336
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,389
these at films is up ily things and then
and then speed them up and and they

337
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,020
really called put those on the site we
document the classes that we teach

338
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,360
and and and how we teach those is one
the class is going on a

339
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,669
this is that some some stuff from other
sites we've taken away and we we talk

340
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,110
about this

341
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,580
you know large we know stuff cuz were
largely no obsessed and that just

342
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,649
explaining how things worked linking to
the code different things like that and

343
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:39,340
also on the site we tweet we show where
our classes are and how you can sign up

344
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,980
and and things along those lines we have
a a calendar

345
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,570
over here we have with people to donate
seashell Dhoni

346
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,899
I'm we have in our IRC chat the people
can go on and talk about

347
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:54,370
at actual these guys are talking about
their pants status but I get to that

348
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:54,799
later

349
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,379
and then we had we at we we put things
on other sites so you know we put our

350
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,870
videos above how we make things on on
you too

351
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:05,840
blip.tv video this is that the danger
shield which is really cool

352
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,189
product that we're sign down stairs and
the people put them on the persons like

353
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,179
this is Bri site

354
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:13,210
I'm pretty set up there at this is ax
give site

355
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,380
and then pretty much anywhere else that
we can actually documented show what

356
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,340
we're working on these are photos a on
Flickr how to build things

357
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,559
on the make site and and and also we
tweet about things

358
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,450
and and you'll see that this tweet is
about somebody not wearing pants and

359
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,179
that's because

360
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:32,110
one night we are out and and and restore
my cell phone is in a tweet that said

361
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,270
10 staticy cause I'm not wearing pants
in a public place

362
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,000
at so you can actually send a pet status
three right now it'll go to go on

363
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,200
on the pants status web sites up at Penn
status dot com

364
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,059
and then we at we also have a wiki and
and this is really where we document

365
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,120
everything and allow people to come on
it and and

366
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,299
and and and download tutorials this is
the Eagles Charlotte attacks on my

367
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:53,990
before

368
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,980
the game by 10 on classes we put code on
their we put all these different things

369
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,790
on there

370
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,590
and so we're not fucking around pretty
much like that's what about counted

371
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,090
well its

372
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,649
someone hacks and as you can tell were
incredibly awesome

373
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:14,840
I have no idea how to advance the slides
right pro

374
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,309
awesome think thousand so the question
is how do we stay awesome

375
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,370
cuz we are pretty awesome and answers we
fail

376
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:26,700
you take failure as a target

377
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,790
film massive all kinds of research is
coming out saying that

378
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,480
the best way to learn is to just screw
up over and over and over again

379
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,840
so some ways to fill interestingly said
impossible deadlines

380
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,230
we're gonna by and master and bring to
help a laser cutter

381
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,460
yeah okay

382
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,230
expect you'll get unlikely levels of
participation so if we can just get a

383
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,580
hundred and forty-four people

384
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:58,840
each for the 120 mo what laser we can do
blinking lights to the space station

385
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,370
really easy and the last thing is don't
be the man you know

386
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,320
the men you can only tell you what the
system should do know what you should do

387
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,460
with that

388
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,139
you should read the manual after you
fuck a

389
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:16,200
so for example what's the contest on
clothesline

390
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,260
I

391
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,230
ok hank

392
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,030
again that's while you're doing all
these things about failure make sure you

393
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,600
put safety someplace on a number line

394
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,309
safety third tends to be bad luck to
stay away from safety third

395
00:22:35,309 --> 00:22:38,570
but anywhere between 10 and approaching
infinity flowing

396
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,320
the more judgment used the lower
priority complete safety

397
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,010
for epic success you most epically fail
first

398
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:57,010
which brings us to just

399
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,730
so my party talk is on things I could
destroy us

400
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,040
which a guest is pretty self

401
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,830
explanatory so womanhood group

402
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,639
of it's a Mac it's really hard to use
yeah

403
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,770
okay things like a distressed number one

404
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,400
on a bottom bottom-up

405
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,160
so is what we're saying here is when
you're in the hackerspace people have

406
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,030
great ideas

407
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,280
and so those ideas are incredibly
dangerous don't always go along with

408
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,590
them

409
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,120
sometimes you have to say that might
kill me or that will kill me

410
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,540
or that guy over there is bleeding and
it's a bad idea so

411
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,980
don't screw up don't get the lawsuits
and don't die

412
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:47,390
green energy

413
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,790
so stay sickly

414
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,629
since I'm a huge fan of the republican
party and I'm totally not

415
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,760
communist um I have to up

416
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,990
provide the counterpoint here to allow
these hackerspace is exist in

417
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,770
metropolitan areas for a reason

418
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,240
it's because a lot of people in it area
where there's not a lot of

419
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,930
you know space so a lot of us run around
we get these hackers basically live in

420
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,840
small apartments

421
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,449
and its easy because a lot of us in a
single isolated area if he suddenly

422
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,610
develop a great green Energy's resource

423
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,620
we might spread out and what will happen
I don't know

424
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,590
but as it is it's really freaking being
solder

425
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:32,240
I so

426
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,470
yes I wrote that whole thing I so

427
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,049
siders really bad for you so is a lot of
other things I

428
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,820
Eric was here I would add tell you about
a optical incident involving

429
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,039
I think they're chloride not a good idea
solder

430
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:49,408
also get lead poisoning this this
happens it's not a joke

431
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:53,169
you know exercise precautions and
working with interest chemicals

432
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:58,190
pressure same idea

433
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,190
so the other thing is storing

434
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,140
in keeping cut chemicals can be
dangerous if you are making your own

435
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,909
black powder

436
00:25:04,909 --> 00:25:08,380
you're probably going to get arrested
sorry

437
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:15,270
up its gang wars with rivals

438
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,110
so

439
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:22,169
there are a lot of hacker space is out
there they're the Germans are the New

440
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:24,010
Yorkers are washing DeSean

441
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,059
billion I guess all the West Coast guys
were

442
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:31,440
crazy don't get into wars with them

443
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,260
be friendly I know at times it's hard
when Nick Farr comes up to your knees

444
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,658
pat you on the head calling you names
high-tech

445
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:43,340
I don't do that

446
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,960
to hackers enter one hackers leaves
competition is healthy

447
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:54,100
just doesn't know we all die by the way
I just signed mention that up

448
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,860
my Dr mortality it's true we all die

449
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,130
sorry the Amish

450
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,480
I

451
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,200
they're out there but

452
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,780
they are real okay

453
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,809
so it in our current day and age

454
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,918
LED's are kind of dangerous I mean you
going to an airport with LED's I knew

455
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:25,929
you get attacked

456
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:30,360
its it's what's going to happen so
exercise some caution remember that not

457
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,110
everyone out there

458
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,900
understands technology in people react a
little strangely too especially in these

459
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,390
trying times where there's

460
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,860
terrorist out to get us and the TSA

461
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,539
so police report

462
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:48,919
don't put on a jacket with flashing LED

463
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,059
countdown clock you know that's don't go

464
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:56,960
running through here airport I okay

465
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,659
I yet itself up next

466
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:07,659
Large Hadron Collider could kill us but
not for the reasons that anyone knows

467
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,179
about cell

468
00:27:13,179 --> 00:27:17,250
I like to thank you sir nasa because
hackerspace collected in the world

469
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,010
yeah best with the best toys for sure

470
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,230
self you gotta love when these guys get
together have a conversation about the

471
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,950
end of the world

472
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:29,570
being possible with my their experiments
and whether or not this is something we

473
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:30,520
should be concerned about

474
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,270
self yet they could kill us all

475
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,270
arm poverty

476
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,639
toys are expensive blowing up toys even
more expensive

477
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,890
burning your space down time expensive
leaving the door open the middle

478
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:49,360
Metrotech also expensive is lotta ways
run out of money

479
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,380
and you know thing I just basically said
around in boxes or garbage files as the

480
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,220
case may be

481
00:27:54,220 --> 00:28:01,220
and then there's creepy people now

482
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,700
if you have a hackerspace you have
people over

483
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,539
its it's a communal thing a social
aspect which means

484
00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:15,419
even if you've been up for four days
straight and you've been coding nonstop

485
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,440
you might want to do. spray something on
yourself I mean

486
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,870
obviously this is a joke a lot of people
over here are famous

487
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,320
pedobear special he's a good guy arm

488
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,779
the they are

489
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:32,860
creepy people

490
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,830
don't have min your space because it
scares the women folk away

491
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,139
these don't ban me yep

492

yeah so

501
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,880
we are a que te Kura it is really great
is that every hackerspace have a cake

502
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,340
hacker this is the a cake for some extra
cheese it's actually

threats this this on points this is

505
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:44,270
the PDP code for happy birthday yeah

506
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,040
with which is awesome and I'll

507
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,240
what I think that happened that we
didn't explode that a third an added

508
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,730
bonus every hackerspace

509
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,900
is we've actually um we've all become
really good friends

510
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,970
and which which is just really nice read

511
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,160

515
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,570

516
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,950
not come into be smelly

517
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,050
yeah I'm and now we've actually got

518
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,370
I'm a considerable amount of time a hope
got a half an hour for questions

519
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,179
and if you don't ask questions will just
good and another pretty but also climb

520
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:40,650
up

521
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:46,620
questions yes the Guyana

522
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,140
with the hand good

523
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,320
I love

524
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,960
you we do we have a I'll

525
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,720
so it's interesting what yeah

526
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,960
yes doing the registers I

527
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,250
but if you are actually it outcome to
you

528
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,650
if you go to the site is that place
there's a

529
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,390
account today you can see but we can
hold the mic a controlled study group

530
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,910
once every few weeks sometimes every
month it it depends

531
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,170
and so it is prolly gonna SQLite
download it for the summer but once

532
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:30,060
Toxicol Danny I want most are doing a
little more

533
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,590
yet for the party party you may get
blown up

534
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,600
or something fun like that our robot
might get you drunk

535
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,010
yes his your all servers

536
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,500
circuit breakers like for space

537
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,700
dude Mike

538
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,230
for Street some we should have taken
that into account

539
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:00,560
got I offered I think I I thought that's
what so ever dare to

540
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,820
the microwaves the biggest offender

541
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:08,870
and also I'm

542
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,179
so we're looking into getting a laser
cutter and wanted the issue said

543
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:15,630
came up was a school huh Italy's are 15

544
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:19,200
power it somehow um and so what we're
actually looking at this point is having

545
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,800
to have

546
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,330
I'm a contractor come in and put in more
electricity because the front

547
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,340
so it's definitely something that you
should consider in your space

548
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,640
and a and also what your needs are for
exactly

549
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,030
equipment you plan on using should
always steal power to

550
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:41,030
in

551
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,409
research is yep

552
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:53,409
percent said that's a very good question

553
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,399
hah don't talk about

554
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:01,009
okay I can no longer talk about it yes

555
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:05,139
there's nothing special about Fight Club
you can have a fight club in your town

556
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:05,749
as well

557
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:09,340
I keep

558
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,649
I'll I him

559
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:17,950
that what was the question how to get
people to pay dues

560
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,990
has actual take that one arm

561
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,460
well you have to be a real bastard about
it so

562
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,740
make sure your treasure is a jerk sack

563
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,210
that's me or at least able to be a jerk
at certain times

564
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,210
but seriously I we use Pay Pal

565
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,929
on because in this like recurring
payment service and so

566
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,139
that way like the money just comes in
every month and

567
00:33:42,139 --> 00:33:46,529
you don't have to but people cuz like
bugging 30 people to give you money

568
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,730
every month is

569
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,879
is not fun was like enough is comes
either

570
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:55,340
bank account like that forget about it
I'm

571
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,360
just a question was I'm how do you get
the people in an existing group to paid

572
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,619
user how do you find a group of people
who are willing to pay dues bird

573
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:06,200
we've actually just been having internal
discussions

574
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,869
and decided to raise argues spinner the
we're all paying

575
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,020
um in order to have a more comfortable a

576
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,589
cushion in our bank account so that
isn't a problem

577
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:23,589
that we've had today to

578
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:30,639
27 members over there we plan to take
over the world

579
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:35,078
one hacker time now if we act 3

580
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,609
and probably we're actually basically

581
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,409
stopping for the moment it new members
because we're it's kind of a left then

582
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,839
we can I want to get to know everybody

583
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,609
and then once redo will we'll go from
there

584
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:50,710
we got 27 now

585
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,609
three times three times three I

586
00:34:55,609 --> 00:35:01,049
his back there good

587
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:08,049
rule you should totally come to Nick
farce presentation tomorrow is going to

588
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,690
talk about that

589
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:16,690
and you and I didn't know that they
exist

590
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,130
so when we first started it was it was
actually ridiculously cheap it was forty

591
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:27,950
three dollars a month

592
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,750
and which KP forty two dollars sorry I
apologize please don't beat me up later

593
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:35,430
and but at and the call was we're gonna
have

594
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,730
you know forty members are several we
didn't know how big of a space we're

595
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:39,740
gonna get and the space week got

596
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,540
at quickly filled up with a lot of
jumping tables and tools and things like

597
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,340
that and so

598
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:48,720
we recently just reevaluated in and we
punted up to

599
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,700
seventy if I 75 citing wanna get their
own

600
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,940
and and so and that that's actually an
innocent question

601
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,580
the weekend you know help love money in
the bank for when we won't need to get

602
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:00,960
things like tables in

603
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,570
or chairs and things like that passes
house

604
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,860
boo arm the classes

605
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,970
work really well on when things are
going to do like the classes were

606
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:19,870
are a good way to earn money for the
space we also want to make sure that the

607
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:21,509
teachers are fairly compensated

608
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,100
on so like there some other places where
people can tease in the it like be like

609
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,080
an hourly rate

610
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:31,770
on what we do is to split it 50-50 so
for teachers a full class in there

611
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,220
they're making some pretty good money
sell om

612
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,370
that that works pretty well I mean it's
definitely not enough to pay the bills

613
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,630
so you know which is why we're raising
do this because

614
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:47,280
arm what were the reasons we're raising
do this is because a

615
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,750
we wanted to make sure that all the the
space itself was paid for by the members

616
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,710
so we don't have to like

617
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,360
every month scrambling are we gain of
classes re

618
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,210
you know we need to throw a party to
make money like we want the space to be

619
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,490
in a safe place so that like if you know

620
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:06,500
everybody gets busy and Mike July in

621
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,160
going to hacker conference is every week
and that the spaces in

622
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,250
just a min to crumble and fall away
itself

623
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,600
but the parties in the class are great
because om

624
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,810
in addition to the do sale hours to
serve bill up this war chest that we can

625
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,700
then use to

626
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,230
like to cool projects are you know maybe
by laser

627
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,640
or me in you know do things that are

628
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,690
you know beyond just paying the rent
because not just paying the rent is not

629
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,650
a good place to be

630
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,680
the classes in the parties are also

631
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,819
really amazing because the community
that's built around it and the classes I

632
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,410
mean everyone that's come has been
really great and we've had

633
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,960
you know people ask for different
classes and its its the community aspect

634
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,010
is simply amazing

635
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:52,550
Corp

636
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:56,490
yeah

637
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,800
%uh and thanks

638
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,950
said other after

639
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,720
model use arm so we

640
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,960
for no real reason all just decided to
incorporate is in LC

641
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,410
on I use the word on the street is that
doing

642
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:18,029
a corporation like that like somehow
shields you from getting sued

643
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:21,260
existence is a person sela

644
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,640
you know we want to make sure that you
know by building space and we were gonna

645
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,049
put

646
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,560
in your the like initial founders
everest personally

647
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,630
oMG that's already serve the big rest in
itself just like star

648
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,260
space like this so we want to make sure
that like enough

649
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:39,410
if Nick cuts his hand off on that on

650
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:42,430
chops on that you know like

651
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,819
re Miller feed our kids I

652
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:52,820
ethnic small up

653
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,790
yep and reuse talk about the
marshmallows

654
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:05,870
oh yes oh I

655
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:10,330
Danielle came over with some homemade
marshmallows

656
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:14,060
to twits video yeah

657
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,779
and it took all I think it took like one
minute before Max was like

658
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,400
um Wiley roasting these over the Jacob's
Ladder

659
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,350
and you know what case federal the wifi
is anybody gonna have to computer

660
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,130
it's not months ahead

661
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:33,940
ago as a yes to both answers I progress
since

662
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,070
a okay I'm the backup you go to my
sisters so

663
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,400
there's a good video that so we don't
repeat reply to the Jacobs ladder bounce

664
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,350
a but i think thats the only thing we've
actually done the space

665
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,250
but got other people who are obsessed
with but it's not just my control stuff

666
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:49,500
so

667
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,610
so you know like dinos working on a
lotta programming

668
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:55,920
things and as the game boy stuff in it
so there's a bit this wide variety I

669
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,160
think that the Michael to control stuff
really

670
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,750
shows more in the photos cuz its fun to
take which is blinking lights

671
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,970
you know things like that so back

672
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:12,970
then the right gotta hand I only started

673
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,310
a the people who up has only started
Europe we like

674
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:23,660
how do we get this off the ground and
then the nine of us who are

675
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,509
at that time he'd put in a thousand
bucks knowing that you never see it

676
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,080
again

677
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,170
and that was kinda are yeah

678
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:34,370
thank thanks a lot guys

679
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,740
could therefore we are kinda like I

680
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,980
right up until that program like I love
this exists or not

681
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,850
in which put a thousand bucks in and it
was like fuck yeah this is gonna exist

682
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,360
those pics thousand bucks in

683
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,700
yeah so um which is a it was just a
route for this in my mind it was like

684
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,740
this with someone like

685
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,500
yeah okay this is going to classes can
really happen to like yes

686
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,630
combos question got I'll

687
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:06,110
sake so that point but the Syracuse and
then %uh then it sort of went to like

688
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,550
okay

689
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:11,360
who needs keys and so like after I think
Lisa had woken up Zack Ryder

690
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,050
10 to 15 times to build on the space
like finals I find your keys

691
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,790
and now I can you like pros like you see
the date for the dealers are deposit is

692
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,740
you have to the hardware store around
the corner

693
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,350
and spend twenty dollars on something
for the space

694
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,089
and then different cities is like that's
a key deposit

695
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:33,080
yeah any of the lockout three times

696
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,340
I think that some reason we started meet
the reason I never was that they were

697
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:40,020
the core start members in the company's
computer system so that we'd the people

698
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,200
but it does not have the keys in the
other people

699
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,560
would have to kazakh in the morning when
he was sleeping to get in

700
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,970
and and the community of people that but
we ended up

701
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,510
that end up doing is basically members
was too so great that we

702
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,460
we realized it wasn't any different she
Asian and so that was really important

703
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:02,420
it's an attested to that point I i
accepted 31 Sam

704
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,670
you know where are we at with a meeting
every Tuesday night when the government

705
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,660
first Russian I said

706
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,759
you know you look around the the people
that are part of this group is this

707
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,030
really really amazing

708
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:13,140
it's it's an amazing group back there

709
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,140
come to our party

710
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:26,790
I classes yet to causes come to the
microcontroller study group only post

711
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:29,370
%uh public events on our blog whenever
we have them

712
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,400
on it's a great way to kind of come and
get involved and that sort of stuff

713
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,960
you know you don't have to have a
project you're working on come to

714
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,780
migrants are

715
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,530
so you can just have an idea or just
want to talk about to people about what

716
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,300
they're working on

717
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:45,080
I'm so it doesn't have to be structure
and in the PSN and it's great another

718
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,670
hacker group start doesn't you know that
doesn't 271 Agrippina my CD rates so

719
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:52,690
you know in if if anyone's interested
you should come and talk to any was

720
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,770
afterwards and we can

721
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,150
we can explain or cork email as and when
you come by the space and explain what

722
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:57,910
we went through in

723
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,580
and how you can start your own hacker
club to we also

724
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,900
on Thursday nights um and we're not
having these

725
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,340
for the rest of the summer but will
resume again we have craft night

726
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,530
answer people come to the space with
more craft oriented projects but that

727
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:17,010
doesn't preclude other people working on
certain electronic space Products

728
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,670
on and that's another time the the space
is open I me know

729
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,130
I mean I'm be little I mean we usually
don't tell people exactly how to become

730
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,730
a member quite honestly but

731
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,000
I'll tell you basically ish you have to
arm

732
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,500
yet we pizza making love him invited to
be a member

733
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,370
if all a big members can our consensus
that this personal

734
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,730
is it will be an awesome feather and
basically the kinda

735
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:46,430
like ur tears that they should have some
mobile kung fu interestingly enough

736
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,509
remember who actually thought that that
meant the new

737
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,220
had no confluent luckily she knew coming
from and

738
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,620
of I and um

739
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,850
there have to be something that we feel
like we could give their our house keys

740
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,580
to them

741
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:06,029
and be able to go away for a month and
come back and our permit would be in

742
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,210
just as good as or better shape so
that's kinda what our criteria those are

743
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:11,280
kinda some food definitely helps with
that

744
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,390
I no so that's a that's kinda criteria
for

745
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:20,410
because it's because we're young work
but basically this is only existing

746
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,020
because a

747
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:24,970
our friendship and trust in each other
and so it work at were still in kind

748
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:25,390
ever

749
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,540
the labor that's me I'm not gonna if

750
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,430
also you know you may want to come and
check out the classes in comfort is good

751
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,379
as awesome as we see him up here

752
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,230
in privately actually sock

753
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:42,900
sana I was set also like the other thing
with that when we

754
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,230
is that that we don't have members like
a jim has members

755
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:50,540
I everybody is a contributing member
which basically means being involved is

756
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,990
actually

757
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:58,990
like you have you're expected to work
and take out the trash and stuff

758
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,580
another rule fear a here attack club

759
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,810
clean your fridge seriously

760
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:12,049
good and after you clean the fridge
remember throw out the trash

761
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:17,880
within two or three tests I

762
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,140
keep your eye out for the NYC resistor
guide to house cleaning for Sikhs

763
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,670
group

764
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,190
I think I have 10 minutes if anyone has
any more questions

765
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:34,230
yes yep

766
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:40,000
physical security we have a baiser good
I'm not fucking kidding either we have a

767
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:40,530
Taser

768
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,280
I and I think numerous people have been
taste with it

769
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,930
yeah you can you can use it is it a
lineup LED's

770
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:53,440
his of

771
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,800
westerns we still trust each other way
I'm with business insurance if we all

772
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,460
trust each other never make sure the
doors locked in

773
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,310
you know at but but this insurance on
your

774
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:08,230
I don't think anyone really has anything
have huge value rate

775
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,670
meron yeah if

776
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:15,070
there now we have a link worth stealing
in our space

777
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:18,220
nothing there's a guilty man from the
door

778
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,060
five Tigers mentions the Kung Fu

779
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,290
I

780
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:30,440
the character

781
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,780
arm the danger shield is a funny little
beast

782
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,630
on originally the I had this idea that I
wanna teacher class on how to program an

783
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,700
Arduino

784
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,750
and I didn't feel like teaching new DSi
like put

785
00:46:42,750 --> 00:46:45,770
LED's in a bread boards so I A

786
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,050
made a shield the plugs directly into
the art we know that just us like

787
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,859
sliders and buttons and blinkers and

788
00:46:51,859 --> 00:46:55,460
you know all sorts of things that just
fits into an art we know lets you get

789
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,859
strange programming without having you
know a single thing about

790
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:01,990
electronics cell om

791
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,710
no and then once I made I realized hey
this things really fun to play with and

792
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:06,890
so

793
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:10,420
I its it's a great way to learn or do we
know I it's

794
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,810
the really fun to play with you can do a
logical things

795
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:18,150
with them and Nick wants me to tell you
that there for sale downstairs

796
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,760
home and really help me because
hopefully I can start hacking full-time

797
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:29,270
if I cell 10 more yeah I'm

798
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:33,600

799
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,609
youth

812
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,240
weekend and also there's the hackerspace
village

813
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,359
and down on the second floor arm bad

814

816
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,510
talk

817
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,510
more about what your juices might be for
not starting a hackerspace

818
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,910
and why those excuses are stupid um

819
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:27,129
and not sure whether talks there are
question over then runs to questions

820
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,050
like that

821
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:34,190
in the front first up world in New York

822
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,750
arisen hours like we're gonna do this in
Manhattan

823
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,040
because speak in Manhattan

824
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,500
and I was like how many of us live in
Manhattan yeah

825
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,820
and a and those yeah I was like okay
where you live

826
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:54,920
everybody that near but downtown
Brooklyn so

827
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:59,680
I meant in every resident African good

828
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,379
your park so

829
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:08,060
well there's also there's a guy from the
Bronx is a couple people from Queens is

830
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:12,150
guide from New Jersey so it's not just
Brooklyn but the majority is definitely

831
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:17,109
hers of

832
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:20,400
sheen's yet

833
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,400
I'm be

834
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,190
where you from

835
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,430
just lose yeah

836
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:35,100
yeah there's no tiene the thing is is
you really don't need

837
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,370
like we have 20 27 or so people you know
that you can just you can just do

838
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,589
I mean but one thing that we have that
actually really helped that we didn't

839
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:43,410
expect is

840
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,850
having um shelves if you make people
come

841
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:51,750
and leave their crap there they have to
come back to work on good

842
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:56,020
you but you know week so I i think im 18
excuse for now the city they're not sexy

843
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:59,600
the biggest assets into in the classes
like when I've been at the cost I

844
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,940
usually ask away from

845
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,410
and there's gotta be twenty people have
come to the class is just from from like

846
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:07,330
the outskirts of New Jersey not just
from from New was actually a lot of

847
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,529
people and injures a lot of people

848
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,810
New Jersey they come in I'm sure that
also

849
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:15,370
books looks at the sky and simple have
arms

850
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:20,779
yeah more people don't do it under
honest I fell from like a completely

851
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,920
different perspective

852
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,180
a one other things I do is make and sell
kits online

853
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:28,350
and I I sell kits to places like

854
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,040
Alabama and Ohio and was like back with
places all the time

855
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,540
there are a lot of people out there
there are bored and

856
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,840
there you know if you build it they will
come also

857
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:42,010
you know it's cheesy but it's true also

858
00:51:42,010 --> 00:51:45,350
to everywhere besides New York City rent
is much cheaper

859
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:49,020
you need way fewer people to actually
get a space you build it

860
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:52,160
they hope will come soon to lose it and
and if you're interested in the lease

861
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:54,000
space in why I would say he knows

862
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,690
to register your I'll no NJ resistor dot
com whatever and

863
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,020
and email it to us and to make a nobel
posted next thing you know you'll have

864
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,380
fifty people one remembers

865
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,960
you know it's that simple n we have 27

866
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,050
people and arguable you know we could
have many more

867
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:14,280
in New York City I think that you could
easily find twenty seven people in

868
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,500
Delaware Pennsylvania

869
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,190
done you know talked for mccaw and
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia

870
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:24,660
they've they've got a group here the

871
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:30,710
here work

872
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:37,710
well

873
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,370
see see you in New Jersey you got to
bring your in your crew so far

874
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:49,730
more on that point like II I'm in
Manhattan it takes me like an hour and

875
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,870
20 minutes to get there

876
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:54,799
it's like when you consider like if you
have a car what your radius is when you

877
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,810
can go anywhere

878
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:59,299
%uh like you know an hour 20 minutes
like that's a pretty big area

879
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,380
so mean you might be considering like

880
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:06,210
the area's a liner its because everybody
has a car

881
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,270
New Jersey so almost and

882
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:13,210
and we started meeting every Tuesday in
artist the last year

883
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,640
and we didn't have our space and we met
every Tuesday

884
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,730
until february 14th women's indoor space
we still meet every Tuesday

885
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,400
if but the idea that we're actually
organization for like six or seven

886
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,390
months

887
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,140
just basically every no a

888
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,980
the we men cotton jobs in other people's
houses we met everywhere like

889
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,700
and mother sorting out some we can
actually have to have a space

890
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:43,400
start out one last question I think have
to wrap up

891
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:50,400
we have little gremlins the

892
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:55,670
that dude worse kidding sack I use gold
Phoenix PCB

893
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:00,530
I I wish they give me money for some
service affiliate fee but

894
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,910
and how they kick ass we also have

895
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:07,049
all the ferric chloride that four kills
all

896
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:11,780
if we need to thank you

897
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:18,780
thank you thank you

898
00:54:51,569 --> 00:54:51,819
that
