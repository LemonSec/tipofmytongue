1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,960
just before star up enough to make a few
nights means

2
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,000
and DVD sales of all talks are

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,930
and taking place at the vendee they're
just outside to fund their

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,320
and eyes are Robert Steele speaks

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,870
and there's

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,360
on schedule track information and

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,360
in the use them and cracking at ngos at
nine o'clock

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,239
an outlet at eleven o'clock and
discussions

9
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:54,239
discussion session on packing the body

10
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,670
if anybody can understand my accent on
sticking too fast too shy of

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm come from a land your England

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,790
call Scotland and this

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,990
this is whenever our an oil refineries
pictures your

14
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:22,990
so it's there topical by the usual
disclaimer

15
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,660
I'm I have no qualifications to subject
a they are

16
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,720
and don't believe anything RCA

17
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,080
we fight doing independence arch and as
usual was lost have differing opinions

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,780
depending on your political persuasion

19
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,479
eccentric Setra rights or

20
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,310
as you vote I've already told you I'm
from Scotland solve

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,270
how do they get to New York and

22
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,780
obviously have my talks about you the
environment so

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,780
it's going to be a bit tricky

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,549
Sophie first evolved ball quite
naturally

25
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:10,340
and salute to see when the next ferry
was a long

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,150
had been one since 60's or 70's

27
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,280
so I was kind of over the over the
picture

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,860
and so the only two other

29
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,060
options I could find was their cruise
ships %uh freighters

30
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,569
so I am hooked up there

31
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,700
this the and few ships sailing so the

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,230
the Queen me really something Hampton on
july the 16

33
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,959
good yeah july the sixteenth and it
takes six days so

34
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,540
i'd have missed the conference and

35
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,328
bike I could the previous one was on
june 2nd

36
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:52,739
so I am are tight other a good

37
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,880
a good stay in New York probably
whenever money

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,310
by we just thought they could stay and
those are nice convenient one ceiling

39
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:00,799
back

40
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,110
leaving the July the 22nd and

41
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,290
yeah with the fears a bit pricey not was
the spear star from

42
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,250
I don't think I could take on %um as

43
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,569
three times unfortunately don't think
that i've a true

44
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,420
take about thirteen days each way and
they

45
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,319
go to slightly strange places if you're
passenger

46
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,650
they do come to New York but your spin
on things

47
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,239
and their little bit

48
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,690
by the same prices on a cruise ship so
where

49
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,010
airplanes or either planes as I with 29
Sep

50
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,090
and direct fly

51
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,519
two flights party just under 1000
dollars for the return for

52
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,579
so which do you think it shows about

53
00:03:55,579 --> 00:03:59,549
before tell you I'll go onto the the
nitty-gritty the numbers

54
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,200
and so well led to believe that

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,569
planes are these tetherball carbon
emitting air

56
00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:10,950
vehicles and to some extent the arbor

57
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,209
based on one metric can we use here
which is

58
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:19,560
energy consumption and notion

59
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,610
ocean liner so I think not so something
along the lines of security to use of

60
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,039
passenger capacity of about 3,000

61
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:31,669
and uses about

62
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,159
100 kilowatt hours for the VF
hundred-plus

63
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,590
passenger kilometers and

64
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,070
with I saw eighty percent full Boeing
747

65
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,090
has a slight as a up a better

66
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,240
energy consumption although it depends
how full is obviously

67
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,020
and so

68
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,000
looking at these figures flying is more
sustainable imports

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,469
so is or what we've been led to believe
is that

70
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:13,030
is it wrong well this is on our ocean
liner a few

71
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,419
went back to the fairly soon soft
Titanic type boats

72
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,180
well that's a bad example we had

73
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,830
your yourself first-class so what's your
vision

74
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,419
I don't think he had a swimming pool per
about bus over in 15 min the band in

75
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:32,000
things

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,450
and then you had your you're so hostile

77
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:41,150
what's a bong Bates third-class and so
if you

78
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,360
if you're poor and was was packed to the
rafters

79
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,719
I'm sure you could get much better
numbers and now

80
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:52,909
a plane and of course verse more
complications spike

81
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:56,110
greenhouse gases have a great effect a
high-altitude

82
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:00,840
mmm blah blah blah solve

83
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,760
I picked the flight so

84
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,599
I'm sure most you come across this thing
after know when it's so far start to if

85
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:11,539
anybody knows

86
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:16,180
speak up and that carbon offsetting is
this

87
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:22,830
wonderful thing where you go to the
website and since I some flights

88
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,380
actually

89
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,520
provided as part of the working process
and that gives you this monetary figure

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,490
on how you can

91
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,490
do you something of say the

92
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,440
the carbon that will be released by your
flight and I'll be

93
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,260
used to in various projects plant fees
by energy-saving lighting

94
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,490
build a hydra John when the things I
know it's the bodies as they are mainly

95
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,990
at which is based in the developing
world so it's an idea the

96
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,919
you take a plane flight I'm will get
somebody else to

97
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,609
reduce their carbon footprint to make
make up for your that extravagance

98
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,969
and doesn't really in college you too

99
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:10,870
to come back and be getting nice warm
fuzzy feeling and

100
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,500
so you're this nice little web form that
says for the return flight it's a

101
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,510
1212 pones and fight

102
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,630
a think also go I got an option to

103
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,750
most part my flight that was ten dollars
which I thought was

104
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:32,240
ultra-low

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,770
solve what what's love underpins

106
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,719
environmental threats so

107
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:43,130
there's lots of different environmental
for its

108
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,530
and

109
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,419
some more significant than others and
but what

110
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,840
1 pin forward euros something if you

111
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,830
if you trace things back to the source
probably economics would

112
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:02,830
BR a reasonable guess some

113
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,870
yeah I would that was when the things I
came across numerous arch was the

114
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,140
an I this I'll give you some reference
sisters are

115
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,390
professor a from Cambridge University in
England

116
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:21,650
used to solve drafting a boutique with
the whole the

117
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,830
fam ace energy energy-related

118
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:30,240
figures and that he worked some figures
out for the UK military for their

119
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,830
door so for with all energy usage in
Iraq and that was quite considerable

120
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,130
so some

121
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,669
planets even furious some this probably
familiar to most people

122
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,340
sows wake all these things as free arse

123
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,680
so it's reduce reuse

124
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,560
and recycle song to stare

125
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,430
so go for some these and and I so love

126
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,540
tech cracker

127
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,849
technical typeof this now you

128
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,980
so I do don't know if you've had a in

129
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,980
in the US but n and UK

130
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,600
and they're just so mass media so things
like BBC

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,250
have banned for a new story and that
that

132
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,880
at the end or something the safe
remember unplug your mobile phone

133
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,070
charger can do you

134
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,210
block so where who

135
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,320
on bone saw

136
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,890
people have done some experiments and
plug in an hour

137
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,530
a phone charger with the war war and

138
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:42,490
while your phone's not plugged into
being charged we submit

139
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,510
just under half a war in heat

140
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,350
saw and what

141
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,940
what while a war is our like instant in
your man

142
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,550
instantaneous measure the power
consumption so come on to wall

143
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:03,860
a kilowatt hours is actually consumed

144
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,860
because a me

145
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,620
I

146
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,130
I think you've got some we've got some
type of the going here

147
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,300
and so promptly is saying

148
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,610
going to beat this seventy million
mobile phones new UK

149
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:34,620
I think there's actually less people now
and so I think some may be set in

150
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,570
cupboards or send in a landfill site
with a contract

151
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,000
so they're still can't the network and
some

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,690
I'm I'm being quite conservative in
saying if thirty percent such that the

153
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,310
total so I think this is maybe

154
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,520
over overstating at were to leave the
Chargers on constantly

155
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,130
so this half I for drain then

156
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,060
over the course of the year champion a
slight bias over the course of the year

157
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,160
about a.m. ninety take a walk hours
would be

158
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,160
would be consumed and so what why if the
same thing

159
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,370
wife wife and each each household so

160
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,950
published by twenty 47 20 4.7 million

161
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:22,240
households replaced of standard 60-watt
with far

162
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,570
equivalent uses 11 won't serve energy
and assuming the hot

163
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,670
that light was on for free hours a day
and over the course of the year the

164
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:32,300
abode

165
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,580
1000 325 gigawatt hours

166
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,860
you can see it's quite low last

167
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,260
nice to be you know you shouldn't leave
you move of

168
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,450
phone charger plugged in but I think
sometimes there

169
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,670
there used as a scapegoat

170
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,959
was some more things for for standby on
certain appliances a low

171
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,620
and a star at least the standby mode has
been

172
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,100
particularly wasteful another love

173
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,240
comparison and I'm sure

174
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,530
loss over snow babies and CCTV de
commerce UK i think is

175
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,810
probably the one of the most densely and
populated

176
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,100
and years for CCTVs everywhere

177
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,070
and double-decker buses and

178
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,110
have a great eat CCTV cameras spread
about the boss

179
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,330
and in fact and have a

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,670
a small a LCD display at the fund the
boss

181
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,020
showing you all the camera footage on a
cycling

182
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,090
I think so I haven't walked to the park
consumption wear them but must be

183
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,040
considerable so if they were to run

184
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,620
ninety-five percent of the time
continuously which most of these

185
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,690
cameras are and I've plot the figure 5
what's so there

186
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,280
a lot these cameras use less not Alward
recording equipment and

187
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:05,060
so on will probably use a ASO us using
about 170 to go over so us

188
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,240
said button but more than the mobile
phone charger about

189
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,910
still soak while so

190
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,630
PC power consumption and

191
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,230
just have a show of hands how many
people leave

192
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,090
at least one PC on 24/7 unisex five days
a year

193
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,190
after be on hand to hello I'm thinking a
ways off

194
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,010
not doing it I used to have you're free
but nosed into one

195
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,460
saw another visa bans

196
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,480
we when you had your first computer
whenever that was did you are not 347

197
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,990
so

198
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,620
as interesting who so

199
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,620
so we should make software that crashes
more often by so

200
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,870
I'm sure a quarrel over us can be away
from their computer for more than

201
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,850
well hours days months

202
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,700
and every and you wanna have

203
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,310
you won't be able to more can act
however circle to call here

204
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,130
your home PC you work PC so you have
your free environment eyes left that

205
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:24,280
sewer

206
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,569
wimp most of us know by this suspend to
disk hibernate which

207
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,850
and Stanley this laptop didn't come out
hibernate mode

208
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,860
so maybe wanna see is not quite true

209
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,250
and so that over

210
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,960
so last 10 10 years that's been more or
less %uh

211
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,040
more or less a standard thing and sought
if you combine that with weak up online

212
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,140
services are

213
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,330
technology has been around for quite a
while pink onto

214
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,630
motherboards whereby and if you send our

215
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,930
magic packet and to

216
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:05,530
to the machine is powered off although
it's obviously going to have to be using

217
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,980
their power to

218
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,900
keep his network card up in listening
for packets then all

219
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,710
machine all-star up and if it's been
hibernating that would turn to its

220
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,600
previous state well

221
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,450
because I have keys

222
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,410
am but Bev a clue in the name week up
online

223
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,469
so local area network so if you're I in
the

224
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,760
the whales and you want to wake up your
phone PC how'd you do that

225
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,890
well how to hunt got this working
anchors my

226
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,510
your doesn't support this that
particular fact

227
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,439
and but is possible to set up port
forwarding for the take a look for a

228
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,350
call

229
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,040
and it uses to send it to the broadcast
address

230
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,640
new internal network and the smart
tickles online if you solve go for that

231
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,140
on how to do that and this one of these

232
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,080
at Freds has been going for yours and
I'm sure continue for years is

233
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:11,270
is switching on and off for PC does it
reduces hardware life so does it

234
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,300
as more lately to the hardest to feel
the

235
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,750
is a motherboard good break into cuz a
thermal wear and shock

236
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,920
and soul I

237
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,070
I would say things like discs in fines
if not running

238
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,320
d'oeuvres not subject to to wear and
tear

239
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,810
for and its

240
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,180
store topic for discussion I guess

241
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,890
saw candy a lot worse this is something
I just came across I

242
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:46,210
I've never used that buy was actually
looking looking to use it

243
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,280
solve another show found so many people
if you scan the air

244
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,390
to get on top state things right so
reasonable number

245
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:58,580
and hands up if you think it's got your
net

246
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,110
good

247
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,420
so those no love you have probably a bit
here baby trace amounts

248
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,840
so the use of and it there

249
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,859
and each each sc and neither is

250
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,870
I'm not gonna I'm gonna try to pronounce
s

251
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,140
past is any chemists here don't laugh

252
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:24,360
tetra Florida you think and no new

253
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,720
I think there's a I've a few

254
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,950
different and speech

255
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,800
and HF she's been used over overtime

256
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,860
and so space like the refrigerants was
used in

257
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,620
and other applications as well so I
guess if you

258
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,090
if for there were people who are fused
can dear values turned upside down in

259
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:52,409
frozen things in

260
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,310
your and coming on tonight and so the

261
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:01,570
there's our I forget the name of that
i'm peter and your

262
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,280
some signed to retirement by the the

263
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,080
I was gonna see effectiveness busboy
long hard effectiveness

264
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,050
of an substances for global warming

265
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,919
so and HFC one free

266
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,150
40 has a boat just over am

267
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:27,820
1300 times that affect both the same
volume carbon dioxide

268
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,300
as a greenhouse gas and people are
taking notice

269
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,310
and the EU is find that form and you

270
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,210
automobile air conditioning after
johnnie 2011's

271
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,530
reno's no cutting-edge do

272
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,810
fix fix a problem though and I'm sure
laws

273
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:52,250
lots of other applications like and
their will be faded changing to another

274
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:57,440
similar and compound which has West Sand

275
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,420
last greenhouse gas potential

276
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,940
so alternatives exist and

277
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,010
there's %ah some came across which looks
like

278
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,560
Oct and Nov them ang

279
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,810
time there but in fact you could pump of
bicycle pump

280
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:22,190
and seeing pumped on it for couple
minutes not with pasta we while

281
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,070
and a I guess it wouldn't a top

282
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,678
hey wouldn't last that long because your
doesn't compress

283
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,650
to you well and and obviously if you
limit

284
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,150
eliminate the need for the and be the
sole can the transportation

285
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,720
said researcher and their

286
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,330
get wouldn't name in this but it's often
it's like a

287
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,419
squeeze you think we've kinda looks like
that like a spaceship

288
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,570
mines with the CCC rocket

289
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,899
rights so there's all these

290
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,130
solve problems and things like that but
what

291
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,310
on always talk soon renewable energy

292
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,510
and but what does have something that's
quite some polls

293
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,950
but we can maybe to you and that doesn't
involve lots have

294
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,220
energy so and create producing

295
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,580
fast-food Devo ke it and solar panels so

296
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,939
solar panels take someone turning me on
and electricity

297
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:30,200
the the sequel of manufacturing

298
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,410
the waste processing things so I'm gonna
give examples so hot water

299
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,080
which is quite soft hacker friendly as
you've seen a minute by it.

300
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,540
to its you can go then that
professionally installed system

301
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,010
so let's just companies have sprung up
with this ORF

302
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,780
green and Green Drive

303
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,450
to sell you their know where's so where

304
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,110
esquivel have about six to ten thousand
dollars for domestic property which is

305
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,640
quarrel of call money even if fuel
prices

306
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,000
increase and and around the world is too
from government grants

307
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,870
some some better than others so
sometimes you can get some slightly

308
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,620
better

309
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,150
bear deals I am although quite often you
have to

310
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:20,510
don't feel of the group and have more
complex systems to get the grant

311
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,370
but there's a this a middle ground which
is due yourself cats

312
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:29,020
so they are slightly cheaper see get the
cat from

313
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,889
your local DIY stores take it home
install it because instructions

314
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,350
and so going back to the economics

315
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:43,720
Fred and pay back for these can be

316
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,429
for the ever almost and a few

317
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:52,290
spend ten thousand dollars in a system
and you and only save

318
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,629
a dollar TN hot water heating

319
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,810
market and

320
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:04,928
obviously depends how you much Sun all
sons its own strong think the light is

321
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:08,250
possibly find he textin hot water so
even in

322
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,290
cooler climates such used such as the UK

323
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:15,200
and chanted quite quite good months
delay

324
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,850
and in quartersawn sunnier climates it's
even better

325
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,380
I'm so ice fuel and fossil fuel energy
costs

326
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,550
and increased then the BP by pierre Yves

327
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:33,379
reduced ambers there's a there's a
hacker way of doing it

328
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,720
so put on surviving find some

329
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,000
sign some material so we baseball team
in %um

330
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,060
piping inspector and usual things
applying

331
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:48,090
people say or you can't do that you got
going

332
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:52,879
by then the same structure from all

333
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,810
am war first time certainly

334
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,450
and keep key working on

335
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,710
and with with

336
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,200
Soho or the the technology is quite
simple

337
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,590
you you take your war you pass it
through the panel

338
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:13,730
care for water and but you can go down

339
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,270
much more complicated to use of some
solutions involve pumps

340
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,429
aching do your and

341
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:24,730
comparisons a temperature and I and
decide whether you

342
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,040
your solar panel is actually reducing
the temperature if you hold water

343
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,570
question X

344
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:40,570
you have

345
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,330
damn I'm coming on coming too few other
things the others lists hundreds and

346
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,159
hundreds have

347
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,670
things over there yeah your search
engine is your friend

348
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,500
and so the the P back period

349
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,270
is gonna be a much reduced so if you

350
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,510
if you strange land deals for free and
essence of time is free

351
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,840
and then you can pay back almost
instantly

352
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,820
and about what you have some fun

353
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,659
so just a bit boring stuff

354
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,910
over planning permission promising
things

355
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,790
you don't have people coming and saying

356
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,389
tear off your roof helplessly as

357
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,120
tried to solutions so if you live in a
apartment flat

358
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,740
and it's kind it difficult to stick on
with

359
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,950
you don't have to either get the

360
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:42,520
the landlord all other neighbors
involved

361
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,629
and a little II

362
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:48,660
I came across one source

363
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,590
thing when I was doing my first arch an
searching the web

364
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,300
an that was all about can he be solution
or

365
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,760
saw another one which was largely
sticking I site there

366
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,980
and going for window so it can be done
if you're

367
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,220
not wanting to involving

368
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,250
also sipping things on roofs

369
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:14,950
and yes there's a

370
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,420
soft pet show whether these and so for
me

371
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,450
once I think this is a Alexa are women
on the back

372
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:28,150
and probably some copper tubing that's
been

373
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,059
into some so grey color so a dark color
of it works better cuz it looked sharp

374
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:32,629
heat

375
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,170
and what are the solutions are came
across and that people have been doing

376
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,490
online was actually to use and

377
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,440
silicon piping and so the colder
climates such a sass Scotland

378
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,750
in the one to one of the problems is
that you and if there's water left in

379
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,380
the panel

380
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,960
it will freeze and if use copper piping
you get cracked pipes

381
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,040
so if you something that will expand a
little helps a lot

382
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,610
there's all sorts of to you def

383
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,640
different methods to use those direct or
indirect

384
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,960
and he think so that the indirect

385
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,740
and method parts by and heating some
water and then running every of

386
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,790
a coral inside the horse owner so the

387
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:20,149
the waters actually passing through the
and

388
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,830
panel is not what you uses

389
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,879
in from your heart top and of that

390
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,520
the professional systems and general use
that's over approach

391
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,610
and the way they get boned the then
freezing problem

392
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:39,750
stash the pre antifreeze now not water

393
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,920
so as to be changed every few years in
is obviously an

394
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,160
environmental impacts for that
antifreeze

395
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,530
and to the direct system

396
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,340
which the case the water from the your
whole warsaw under

397
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,380
decipher your your you're there

398
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,870
solar panel and sends it back and to the
hot water tank where hopefully it's got

399
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,770
a little bit hotter

400
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:09,070
source of going

401
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,850
still on the the topic or fruit juice so

402
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,750
missus aung gotten the photograph from

403
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,800
Flickr and I think this is our

404
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,470
Spanish TV store or something and so

405
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,080
I think they're selling things
downstairs which may be on things

406
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:33,290
TV be gone said nobody heard I'm plus if
you listen in the ceiling

407
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:36,649
they've got these and I think the way

408
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,770
halogen downlight first so these things
that

409
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:43,360
I think retail stores have a law them
where the I'm

410
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,490
thing the consumers sixty walls some
like that

411
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:51,100
so where see how many can see their
quell of

412
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,669
no I

413
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:58,620
Pittsburgh publishing things as well so
should have long fluorescent strip

414
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,750
lights in the store

415
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,440
so going on to solve

416
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,530
and I guess more

417
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,460
and reuse and recycle so this was their

418
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,690
picture I think we've taken in London
somewhere have some days there

419
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,890
more after they've been don't in a
stream or river seeping widowed

420
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:25,560
so yes

421
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,639
reducing computer waste and

422
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,450
so using using less hardware so I'm sure

423
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,900
also must be sick to death the V word
and mind

424
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,100
attended a talk earlier and

425
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,630
talking about the security aspects a
very virtualization and how that

426
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,540
virtualization is not particularly
segregated

427
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:53,290
the with vendors say may not in fact be
the case

428
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:57,540
sort out those computer work a quick
minute replaced as frequently as a

429
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,200
as scuttling so how are these
corporations in

430
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,280
large organizations have a policy to
replace a hardware

431
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:14,389
somewhere between free for years and I
think so longest for probably six years

432
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,419
and after that period that the
hardware's

433
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:23,270
partially usable and failure rates may
start to increase

434
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:27,658
again maybe running 24/7 me this link
which could reduce the

435
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:34,659
the lifetime gonna have to get the
finger

436
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:39,159
and nothing is

437
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,350
times the whole thing and should
software have more modest hardware

438
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,190
requirements on

439
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,760
amorphous not a mocha name a particular
product

440
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,629
and interview I think

441
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:59,630
question

442
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,330
yeah I will because obviously this an

443
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:14,570
energy taken to and produced the

444
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,780
new computer transported generally

445
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,970
tune from China at least twice and

446
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,730
completing the components to meet
somewhere transported to accept rough

447
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,870
and obviously the tradeoff is

448
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,220
and if your computer is using four times
in my have electricity

449
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,240
then maybe us work for you've also got
to read

450
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,260
consider the did the energy and

451
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,970
and impact of disposal which is rare for
use

452
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,760
uses their summing if you can do

453
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,440
knots and I'm after so can can you use
your common elsewhere so

454
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
just because it can be used to for your
high and

455
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,730
graphics design doesn't mean the camp
you somewhere else

456
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,950
so on in são level love

457
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:08,500
cascading so you can probably take

458
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:13,000
to a free levels until it becomes
absolutely and utterly

459
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,390
and obsolete so public terminally ill
years downstairs if you've come across I

460
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,460
some machines there average and
preventing

461
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,730
been down a few levels I think of this

462
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,970
waterfall so

463
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:32,860
charities non-profits if if he's able to

464
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,900
dated to them I'm sure they'll then

465
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,590
find a use for again sure some of us
involved in

466
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:43,400
working with them to come home with
their computers

467
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,540
and making social projects community
projects that

468
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:51,060
give fair give people access to
technology

469
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,379
and friends relatives although we've got
to washington come back to you for

470
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,540
computer support for the rest of your
life

471
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,360
and a local freecycle

472
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,630
switched have a mailing list we can

473
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,760
offer up could still cling people coming

474
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,540
collect them and a

475
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,570
if used if you can we use its and
recycling

476
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,010
which quite often actually just isn't
sick as

477
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,570
responsible disposal so there's also
some legislation I don't know both the

478
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:30,389
probably some American equivalent Disney
you and

479
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:35,500
convoy stands for Wiese energy reduction

480
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:40,130
something love and so aspin
responsibility onto you

481
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,300
and equipment manufacturers to take

482
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,990
and equipment back at the end of its
useful life

483
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,810
and and I think they're supposed to try
to

484
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,740
we use it but video from that same
melted down in the

485
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,980
component and metals

486
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,980
reused or disposed of

487
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,420
yet the question is and in the you can
you

488
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,290
make your equipment I have an so toxic
materials

489
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:24,710
those affiliated its a statute call are
the way chance which is reduction of

490
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,440
hazardous substances

491
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,640
so the dissolve an

492
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,580
go hand in hand and so the idea is that

493
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,690
when you do need to do you recycling and
or

494
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,030
Cove and disposal lace easier to do to
quite often it's

495
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,060
and trying to reduce the number love
component hazards associated

496
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,270
easier to extract

497
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:56,270
so with all this and talk for increased
fuel costs and

498
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:01,600
and increasing temperatures and are
really

499
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,610
going to reach a crisis point I'm not
going on saddam

500
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,630
I'm sure nobody knows so

501
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,850
the the the Impressionist

502
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,668
that current levels of resource
consumption

503
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,199
are increasing specially was like serve

504
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,490
and China and your and

505
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:25,690
increasing a loss there industrial
production

506
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,960
although in some cases it's moving out
from

507
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,080
I and other on the pasta world you up

508
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,949
US into those countries so it's maybe
not totaling

509
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,649
increase and one other things are

510
00:34:39,649 --> 00:34:42,859
came across in was in the news last few
weeks

511
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,960
was that as part of the drive to reduce
oil prices

512
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,090
and opec the

513
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:54,950
to avoid producing cocktail

514
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,129
to think it's like me calling up this

515
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,820
fully with a little bit like it as and

516
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,920
isn't being be in college to increase
production

517
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,220
and because one of the rules of
economics is

518
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,500
increase increase the and supply

519
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,790
the the prices late it's a good time so

520
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,090
might work in the short term before
opening up

521
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,320
finite resource you just moving your

522
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,410
date with your of your oil supplies run
I

523
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:28,700
sooner so that when you do reach that
point

524
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,810
where that do the supply is

525
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:36,350
diminished and you can have a a bigger
effect for prices

526
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,240
one other things about oil production

527
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,320
ace those loss if was different

528
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,390
and oil feels with

529
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,240
and easier extraction

530
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,910
and costs opal fan there monetary costs
and environmental costs

531
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:59,240
so are they the easy or oil it's
probably diminishing

532
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:03,940
so there's going to be much more and
difficult and

533
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:07,210
time-consuming and drilling activities

534
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:12,490
so with I guess is not going to be our

535
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,500
no overnight change and there's not
going to be a

536
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,640
crisis tomorrow but

537
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,319
it will be over probably a appeared a
few decades

538
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,310
so might be in some of our lifetimes
children grandchildren

539
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,509
or obviously those

540
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,550
those protections add to my go into too
much detail the protections because so

541
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,860
many conflicting ones

542
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:40,720
the or from and between about fifty
years in 150

543
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,800
yours for for you so laws that

544
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,030
law the solutions burned about is we can
just maker

545
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,380
technology much more efficient

546
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,450
so we can increase the proficiency
overall our PCs

547
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,460
we can make more fish in cars and

548
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:06,880
is not going to help well does pull
their psychological effect to with

549
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,530
all my car doesn't lose much or uses
less less gas

550
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,900
well I can drive a father then see your
back in the same position

551
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,420
I wanted a and

552
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,280
examples because I is an and their

553
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,660
have is using a waste cooking oil to
fund

554
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,470
one car seeking one diesel cars of we
sticking of to do in a passive

555
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:31,390
and

556
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,629
filtering Accenture and saw that was on

557
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:38,630
media article a store where at the they
handed

558
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,690
the driver who'd done this said process
said

559
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,880
I don't feel guilty is no using my car
not and their noise using waste of time

560
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,230
so what

561
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,690
what more can hackers to if we get to
the sort of crisis point

562
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,900
school ones we've reached that point one
soil dry

563
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,560
and the resources are woo

564
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,500
to be very few resources left to use so
where would have to make do with force

565
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:07,890
last

566
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:13,819
solar the plastic cops the their

567
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:18,530
plastic trinkets the times I've

568
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,200
empty cans a fan and

569
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,790
canned air their never what we're gonna
have to be

570
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,380
left me do with so will be we taking up
landfill sites

571
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,980
so possibly conventional engineering
science may be slow to react

572
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,680
and quite often development state maybe

573
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,779
couple decades to come time come to
fruition

574
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:47,390
so I am much using things in

575
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,549
unusual in creative ways is probably
something that comes pretty naturally to

576
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:51,970
us

577
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:55,300
so that might be we'll be able to help
fight song

578
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,290
for example my watch strap is actually
armed guard in there

579
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,210
garden T ed feet I so I had

580
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,800
you buy a cheap watch the watch Los

581
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,200
book watch by people who lost about five
or six years watch drop

582
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,920
last six months she go up by I'm fine
you watch

583
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,460
so you have 10 watches when you only
needed one if you'd had a

584
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,450
I something else that was there

585
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,810
much more repost and death

586
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,680
this sharing knowledge for fathers were
58 and

587
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:36,160
any softening impediment trying to make
try to make money events or you will

588
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,420
will sell you this wonderful and and

589
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,260
technology but it's gonna cost so

590
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,880
just before I fish shop an arse for any
questions

591
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,930
to say get some and credits to

592
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,390
Emerson you give us some love talk at

593
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,430
and CCC conference last year

594
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,200
and photographers who I

595
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,859
and use the picture phone for feeling
and their

596
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:09,930
the whole volunteers and organizers and

597
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,618
or people who spend sauce few months
doing all the work now is

598
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:17,690
here looking some cables and lines
yesterday but

599
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,500
all the the people probably haven't
slept all last night

600
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,060
thanks to your home and there's my
references

601
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:34,060
and any questions

602
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,450
maybe you I got an iPhone microphones
working just lose DVD

603
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,930
buyout I would be the question

604
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:49,930
that their

605
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:55,630
here Street

606
00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:02,630
yes

607
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:13,470
yes

608
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:19,620
side

609
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:26,620
years hour

610
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:33,000
work

611
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,860
sure sleep use

612
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,559
work

613
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:42,089
yeah I think there's some drivers

614
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:46,969
and some some i forward movement on some
other stuff so

615
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:50,069
correct me if I'm wrong but I think some
with the Apple

616
00:41:50,069 --> 00:41:54,630
and in your Apple stuff how's this Sat
and idea if using

617
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:58,709
yo wats when its not being in stock
actively connect

618
00:41:58,709 --> 00:42:03,379
something there's also a power supplies
and computers generally if you have

619
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:07,430
come by a computer power supply it's
something like go have a stick on the

620
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,339
bike for 150 wats

621
00:42:09,339 --> 00:42:12,578
saw if if you have a

622
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:17,180
the PC in its effectively I'd also the
CPU's and drawing much

623
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,259
and power are the tests so maybe

624
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:24,709
in perceive mode upper supply will still
be using maybe fifty wats

625
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,819
because the internal components are such
that

626
00:42:27,819 --> 00:42:30,900
and ill just lose a lot of heat for it
was a star

627
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,109
if the powers not being actually used so
there's an

628
00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:38,288
those power supplies to

629
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:41,979
have higher efficiencies and although I
think they're

630
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:45,140
the they have so reach the market
village and least

631
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,799
quite specific so not been paid in PCs
by default

632
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,170
the the perfect trip and

633
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,229
there's obviously SAR some devices like
mobile phone charger the obviously tone

634
00:42:56,229 --> 00:42:59,589
mind so and if you were to

635
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:03,920
have for the five for them an easier way
of doing that with the plug it into

636
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,229
per shoot for five in just unplug the
power strip obviously there's lots to

637
00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:09,969
the Sophie C ours

638
00:43:09,969 --> 00:43:13,779
and some things that probably don't even
need a clock in them

639
00:43:13,779 --> 00:43:17,029
so this these things that have clocks so
might the waves

640
00:43:17,029 --> 00:43:20,329
okie can set the microwave to to keep
your your

641
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:24,459
dinner before you get home and but
you'll see if you walk around the place

642
00:43:24,459 --> 00:43:25,959
you'll see lots of things washing

643
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:28,868
12/12/12 and

644
00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:32,700
so I'm get I dismissed definitely some
some room for a room for improvement

645
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,039
there

646
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:40,039
the other questions

647
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:55,589
the the question is have complete the I
compared to difference between

648
00:43:55,589 --> 00:43:58,609
at both complain but what's difference
between d

649
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:01,619
was that in the plane and see which
we'll travel

650
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:06,249
and it depends on the distances involved

651
00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:11,009
and bought and also the occupancy

652
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:14,089
of the whatever vehicle so if a tree in

653
00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:17,828
is full has a much better and

654
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:22,419
energy consumption Park passenger them
see our

655
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:26,109
a car playing if you have a a train with

656
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:29,538
10 people into it's a spree were

657
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,899
and subject generally if

658
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:36,699
a fan and if you want to look up the

659
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:40,469
the do references and its

660
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,009
the one in particular is an this

661
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:48,019
professor David mmm Mikey and he has
this

662
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:52,099
and quite long and very detailed big and
it's in the draft for me

663
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:56,159
can go online and with a whore you're so
that goes into what these energy

664
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:57,630
calculations into

665
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,339
huge amounts to detail and including

666
00:45:01,339 --> 00:45:06,749
and why you if a plane was tied for
Julie &

667
00:45:06,749 --> 00:45:09,880
which uses speed in my actually use more
energy

668
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,819
in order to keep that you're born and so
the

669
00:45:13,819 --> 00:45:16,929
the those standards and figures average
and we fit if it

670
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:20,789
if hope if it takes off the ground its
high energy consumption

671
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:24,349
you know equations

672
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:31,349
yep

673
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:34,320
this

674
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:41,320
soul

675
00:47:06,099 --> 00:47:13,099
says

676
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:30,870
yes

677
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,580
yeah I know a lot of ways I am Vortec

678
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,330
motek technologies in way sexy
technology gas

679
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:46,360
so you know space space travel you know
you

680
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,750
it's the quake quiet politically

681
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,860
a good thing to do in things Amilo
things

682
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:56,900
me as you say and studies in

683
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:01,480
tease goldwater all collagen things and
isn't as

684
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:06,920
it will make the new system is to such
an extent and

685
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,020
and the example given the above of a
solar hot water

686
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:14,030
am that's nice a volver

687
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:17,190
so renewable small-scale energy

688
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:20,550
that's the one that's simplest a house

689
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:25,340
least byproducts so wanted when I was
steamer sarge one that the

690
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,490
and the sofa hacked

691
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:31,720
and versions issues to a small fall to

692
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,880
for Devo ke move to for Devo ke etc and

693
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,430
solar cell next to the the war powell to
fund the pump

694
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:43,279
at 1200 then professional

695
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:48,070
Kwan Court systems actually use
electricity to pump the water around the

696
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:48,910
solar panel

697
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:52,120
so they lose about 20 percent

698
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,230
of the and well both

699
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,470
of the twenty percent of the energy n

700
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:02,160
Elektricity and use and

701
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,440
sauce a case where and

702
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,340
be keeping it simple is that definitely
a

703
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:16,340
a better plan

704
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:31,250
me

705
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:42,580
all

706
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:49,580
okay

707
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:41,400
all

708
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,260
me

709
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:51,260
three

710
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:25,210
K

711
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,520
me

712
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:38,520
you

713
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,560
right

714
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:04,560
night i think im gonna just want one
more point and then we have to go

715
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,280
good

716
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:29,740
home

717
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:36,740
so

718
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:54,890
I thought it was fun
