1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,880
after kevin Mitnick arm

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,530
thank you for the opportunity deals with
iraq my name is Joshua ginsburg and I

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,860
served as Senior Systems Administrator
for the Free Software Foundation

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,369
in the world a free computing the EFSF
is the orthodoxy

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:23,720
the ones who put their money where their
mouth is good

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,689
and go out in the world to proclaim the
Gospel the good news

7
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,980
but our efforts have somehow progressed
the cause a Freedom of Information

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,320
from restriction in general but more
specifically the software

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,510
as Senior Systems Administrator usually
only presents

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,620
to talk shop about the complexities
assistance

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,550
infrastructure improvements web
application platforms and other such

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,030
black-and-white 0&1 developments today I
get the chance to speak with you today

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,649
about

14
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,159
the value of your liberty because while
the new project may very well have

15
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:54,030
succeeded

16
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,440
increase in the free operating system we
needed the work for software

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,568
individual freedom is far from over what
I love my talk

18
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:04,829
today suggests that is we're going to
talk about the hacker

19
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:08,130
now what exactly is hacker

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,280
what I consider myself one and I'm sure
many of you consider yourself to be the

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,820
same

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,200
or at least have a conception up what
one is and if probe our response is

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,600
probably not unlike justice Potter
stewart: to the Supreme Court

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,939
who in 1964 route for Jacobellis v Ohio
that

25
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,960
I shall not today attempt to further
define the kinds of material I

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,719
understand to be braced within that
shorthand description

27
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,130
Africa perhaps could never succeed in
Intel's we doing so

28
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:38,189
but I know it when I see it if you're
laughing it's because you know what he

29
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,310
was actually talking about

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,939
much the same with a hacker we probably
should agree that whether a given person

31
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:44,810
has this

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,520
essence the Senate the hacker we can't
quite explain it perfectly what makes

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,240
one a hacker

34
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,759
but we know we see in so I'd like to
start with an exam this gentleman want

35
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,820
to create a sort of

36
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,350
comments for the intellectual and
cultural

37
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,590
enrichment lawman here's how it would
work: different people from a wide away

38
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:05,979
for

39
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:09,899
white with their wide a rave professions
and social stature

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:14,209
would use this common resource discover
answers to questions they had on any

41
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:15,209
topic think worry

42
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:18,400
in turn when the opportunity arose for
them to

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,980
offer wisdom on subjects they were
knowledgeable about they could

44
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,119
contribute back

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,200
he was concerned about personal
differences in different social agendas

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,030
polluting the quest for the simplest

47
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,310
and purest Ruth so we developed a said
rules

48
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,110
for the community beguiled by to ensure
the end result up the discourse

49
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,110
was a neutral point of view faithful to
empirical truth is possible

50
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,489
at this point you probably waiting for
me to mention the name

51
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:46,830
have Jimmy Wales creator of Wikipedia
and Wikimedia family of sites

52
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,010
however the community I was referring to
was for older hot leather apron club

53
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,950
and founded by benjamin Franklin the
club's members will pose questions

54
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,069
intellectual moral or social interest
they would debate

55
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,650
discuss and research the questions at
the end of it their produce

56
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,150
a an essay compose describing the club's
conclusions

57
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,549
rather quickly they discovered that
between them they own

58
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,189
relatively few books to use new research
and the shortage

59
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:16,170
could not easily be corrected because
the availability of books was too low on

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,360
the cost was too high

61
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,680
as a result Franklin instigated a peer
to peer sharing program remembers the

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,110
club would make available to the
collective group

63
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,239
the whole love their library so no
members intellectual

64
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,939
and cultural enrichment was limited by
scarcity of materials or financial

65
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:32,750
resources

66
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,480
franklin had actually disregarded
copyright laws in the day

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,760
an early i RUV the contemporary
publishing industry sparking a wildfire

68
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,090
American publishers republishing British
works without their office consent

69
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,099
we continue to look at Franklin our
sense of deja vu repeats

70
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,340
much like a modern visionary we know
very well Franklin set of copyright and

71
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,030
patents

72
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:57,810
and that as we enjoy great advantages
from the invention of others

73
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,840
we should be glad an opportunity to
serve others by any invention of hours

74
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,400
and us we should do freely in generously
and that despite having invented many

75
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,610
products that would affect

76
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,700
untold fortunes in the market franklin
never made no proposed to make

77
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,980
the least profit by any of them

78
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,989
Franklin was a miscreants

79
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:21,660
as a taunt in intellectual rival to an
intellectual rival Franklin predicted

80
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,949
his rivals def

81
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:26,150
in the Poor Richard's Almanac or some
bastard the france

82
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,500
he submitted fake articles the French
press simple to see how ridiculous a

83
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,600
story he convince them to print

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,030
by comparison Steve Jobs and Steve
Wozniak used to build and sell boxes

85
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,449
place to place free long distance phone
calls

86
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:40,590
prior to founding Apple computers
richard fineman

87
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,690
research on the Manhattan Project with
cracks ace containing classified

88
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,870
information simply to see a pic with

89
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,620
franklin's inventions were hacks he
invented bifocals

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,669
because he was tired switching between
two pairs of glasses

91
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,250
consider his contemporaries one cells
with indoor fireplaces

92
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,080
and as a side effect they would often
inadvertently burned their houses down

93
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,520
from observing this this social ills his
solutions included the franklin still

94
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,690
a Volunteer Fire Brigade and the first
fire insurance company

95
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,380
he hacked no da mettere onto his
carriage nor make postal delivery more

96
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,300
efficient

97
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:18,080
there was no end to his ability to
devise creative and unique solutions to

98
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,380
practical problems

99
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,639
the purpose a general social benefit

100
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,520
what these qualities a Franklin all have
in common isn't really miss

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,130
by which I do not mean standing
perpetually as a dye Paul against the

102
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,650
desires authority

103
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,960
but instead a disposition in which rules
limitation and barriers

104
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,969
an axiomatic in nearly except instead

105
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,009
every lock is made to be picked every
law of nature design to be questioned

106
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:47,250
and every problem an opportunity for
solution

107
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,009
Franklin will certainly was the epitome
was not unique among

108
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,449
the framers the framers themselves were
in a sense

109
00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,199
government hackers bread at the cynical
philosophies of Hobbes and Locke

110
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,180
is been much noted that hack is both a
term for an elegant solution

111
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,560
an ugly one but they both disregard
rules

112
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,310
the framers hacked government modules
together orange in opposition to one

113
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,039
another

114
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,789
so the excesses have one will be
tempered by the other

115
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:18,190
for example much like the surely
subsequent French Revolution the framers

116
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,819
believe government rules the has to the
government

117
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,900
and us democracy should guarantee the
people's assent to its leaders

118
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,669
yet unlike the French the four did that
democracies whims and excesses

119
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:33,270
with layers republicanism and the forms
as

120
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,789
the forms of State appointed senators
collegiately elected president

121
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:41,270
and presidentially appointed justices
they recognize the majority's decision

122
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,948
should guide the ship of state

123
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:46,530
the tempered its power civil liberties
strictly limiting the avenues

124
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,740
state power and shorten the American
experiment

125
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,590
as a constitutional libertarian
democratic republic

126
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,389
was in fact a government by hackers and
for hackers

127
00:06:57,389 --> 00:07:01,240
and the results this cultural
unwillingness refusal to accept the

128
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,340
restrictions and limitations

129
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,150
given to us as maybe United States a
mecca for hacker culture

130
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,009
if this were true if they want something
so compellingly American about the

131
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,310
Senate the hacker

132
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,690
it would be simply for anyone anywhere
to create a community

133
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,819
in which we can see the symptoms
agriculture

134
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,400
Paul Graham venture capitalist identify
several such symptoms

135
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,669
innovative and competitive startups
educational institutions that attract

136
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:30,198
and develop the upcoming hacker
generation

137
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,789
and culture of compulsive creativity and
irreverence

138
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:37,530
driven by intellectual curiosity in
practice

139
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,470
this doesn't happen elsewhere what makes
it work

140
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,500
let's look at three American centers
where this is an a hacker

141
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,560
is found Silicon Valley and San
Francisco Bay

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,770
the route 128 quarter in Boston and
Cambridge and the Round Rock area

143
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,128
your Austin Texas the city said the
magical combination

144
00:07:57,129 --> 00:08:00,389
which makes them havens for hackers by
extension centers

145
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:06,220
innovation in creativity grams hacker
center symptoms are all present

146
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,330
they all have universities the function
as centers a free intellectual thinking

147
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,609
san Francisco's geeks flow freely from
both Stanford University in Palo Alto

148
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,190
and the University of California
Berkeley in Boston

149
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,139
hackers fine homes wedge between MIT and
Harvard

150
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,080
and Austin draws hackers from the halls
the University of Texas

151
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,190
they all have plentiful and free-flowing
capital as well as a host of larger

152
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:32,240
established corporations to absorb

153
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,799
and market successful companies and
perhaps most importantly

154
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,630
they have a culture in history that
draws hackers to stay

155
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,810
the cities are filled with young people

in Boston MIT maintains a healthy
tradition

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,900
and encouraging each class to surpass
the hacks the students from the year

an Austin prides itself on the weirdness
of its local culture

166
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,310
so that when zombies marched on City
Hall demanding greater rights for the

Pirates graham also notes that there
have been many well-funded attempts to

170
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,110
replicate Silicon Valley

171
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,100
but none have succeeded between and
Chile in TV and niece

HPX ensuring Honeywell with slow Renton
plentiful band with

but otherwise it's just a technology
park doesn't have hackers

178
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,110
in China the Chinese have dumped
billions of yuan into young from

hackers do not thrive environment we're
coloring outside the lines

183

State defense what these two examples
and countless others lack

184
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:20,170
is a cultural elements the personality
of the city's

185
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,280
is such that people say and do what they
want

186
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,920
without top-down structure more
importantly

187
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,959
good ideas when Thomas Jefferson wrote
to John Adams that there is a natural

188
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,780
aristocracy among men

189
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,839
the grounds that this virtue and talents

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,440
America was built to be in Merrick bill
to be meritocratic

191
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,770
to ensure the good ideas when not
necessarily the idea sponsored

192
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,850
by those with the most influence and
power

193
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,860
and the cycle of power shifting dynamic
competition is by definition

194
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,030
disruptive and impolite

195
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,209
but to the hacker the greater sin would
be to ignore an elegant solution for

196
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,860
fear stepping on somebody else's toes

197
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,430
and what we're really saying about this
cultural elements that the maximal

198
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,030
expression

199
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,520
libertarianism in america the sanctity
of the individual

200
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,390
against the conformity or to any of the
masses requires a certain tolerance

201
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:16,590
disobedience and mischief it was the
same quality in Franklin

202
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,380
the drove him to social hack the French
as was inspired him to reduce property

loss by fire

204
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,709
was the same quality in fineman that
compelled him to cracks ace

205
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:31,590
thats London Nobel Prize was the same
quality in MIT the drive with students

206
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,880
to turn building 1 in 2 r2d2

207
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,480
there was to incubate the new project if
you suffocate one

208
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,210
the other dyes splattering damage when
you have the liberty to be disobedience

209
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,550
healthy tolerance for non conformity and
society in which good ideas when

210
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,630
there you have a place where hackers
will collude to do truly

211
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,960
amazing things and that perhaps his most
valuable

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,100
element the American experiment has to
export the Liberty

213
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,610
the individual 3 dockery a respected
political scientist

214
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,150
study the relation between 12
libertarianism democracy

215
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,180
I found it was the presence of
libertarianism that determine the

216
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:08,740
ability

217
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,740
and wealth and democracy to thrive

218
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,280
where democracy in wealth right he finds
a political system marked not only by

219
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,959
free and fair elections

220
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,980
but also by the rule of law separation
of powers

221
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,370
the protection a basic liberties speech

he claims the Western models best
symbolize not by the mass plebiscite

223
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,860
by the impartial judge it is

224
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,530
disobedience and ruinous a hearty laugh
in the face a problem

225
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,640
that allegedly cannot be solved this is
presented the hacker

226
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,180
and its natural habitat as a cultural
Liberty tolerance

227
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,700
meritocracy so having positive that
liberty intolerance for nonconformity

228
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,130
are necessary catalyst for the
preservation hacker

229
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,720
we now consider how america today is
doing

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,150
US Code Title 17 section 1201

231
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,800
no person shall circumvent a
technological measure that effectively

232
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,790
controls access to work protected under
this title no doubt

233
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,750
there isn't a person in this room
unfamiliar with the anti circumvention

234
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,630
clause

235
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:15,730
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
1998

236
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,510
shareholder in legislator a media mogul
sees this provision as about

237
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,470
the horrendously awful trim the use
called intellectual property

238
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,940
awful incidently because not only does
it obfuscates Sri

239
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,750
completely separate areas in law have
different ensign goals

240
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,160
it is an insidious attempt to graft are
natural attitudes toward the natural

241
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,160
right of property

242
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,670
onto something which lacks the requisite
element scarcity

243
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,600
senator joseph biden ranking Democrat on
the Senate Judiciary Committee

244
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,980
claims that the federal government's
vigilance in shielding intellectual

245
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,090
property rights remains essential

246
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,340
innovation would slow business would
suffer and jobs would dissolve

247
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,660
if technological advances were left
unprotected

248
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,969
to contrast the modern statements be
point with those the framers is

249
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,270
remarkable

250
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,960
the framers recognized hackers and
hacking had that hackers and hacking the

251
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,170
current generation technologies

252
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,410
plant the seeds of ideas the for the
next generation technologies

253
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,430
that hacking innovation both subversive
and disruptive

254
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,560
because when good ideas when they come
from the outside

255
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,900
the current generation statesman
strangles the subversion

256
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,920
ironically in the name innovation when
laws outlaw

257
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,550
hacking those law guarantee the good
ideas will lose

258
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,520
equally dangerous to laws outlawing
hacking a los al all the raw materials

259
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,140
hackers feed upon

260
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,199
hackers are compulsive creators they are

261
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,770
compoz problem solvers and they are
compulsive

262
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:49,569
tankers to deny them access to the media
they used to satisfy the compulsion

263
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,520
will guarantee that new hackers are not
made and all hackers lose their ways

264
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,319
the epitome of this removal of raw
materials is the chemistry set

265
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,940
in 1918 EC Gilbert packaged glass tubes
in common chemicals

266
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,970
together for the first childhood
chemistry set providing curious children

267
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,580
the opportunity to experiment

268
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,400
and tinker nurturing their natural
hacker essence

269
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,210
some %uh the sets included sodium
cyanide radioactive samples with a

270
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,320
Geiger counter

271
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,930
and compounds from which one could def
drive free chlorine gas

272
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,500
or even nitroglycerin today our
chemistry set 7 sterilize

273
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,940
for some chemicals an FBI criminal
background check is required to purchase

274
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,900
them

275
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,030
for others because their use in
manufacturing and fed a means

276
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:36,110
their illegal to purchase their
elemental form

277
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,110
even model rocket engines are being
monitored and restricted

278
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,580
for fear up the use their explosive
propellants

279
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,670
effective this trend is not only a
chemistry set that contains little more

280
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,170
than salt and water

281
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,950
it creates an official discouragement
against learning hack

282
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,000
the higher you raise that bar the more
hackers may decide

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,370
it's just not worth it as much as raw
materials

284
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,040
hackers need other hackers we need to
surround ourselves

285
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,630
with other hackers both a challenge or
limits but to bring his back

286
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,760
we've gone too far the danger

287
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,819
ted kaczynski was a hacker who have too
long

288
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,880
and by sheer probability most hackers
are not born in the United States

289
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,280
the many decide rather quickly that this
is where they belong

290
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,160
it stands to reason that america
benefits from having the pic at the

291
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,510
world's hackers

292
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,030
indeed the National National Venture
Capital Association reported two years

293
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,569
ago

294
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,220
that 40 percent a ball american Public
technology companies

295
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,140
were founded by foreign-born
entrepreneurs to do more stringent visa

296
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,020
policies foreign hackers are studying

297
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,060
elsewhere in 2004 ninety percent of US
graduate schools reported to decrease

298
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,640
international applications most
strikingly in engineering and Natural

299
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,420
Science

300
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:49,730
furthermore those already with advanced
degrees fewer able to complete their

301
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,380
pilgrimages to america's hacker
america's

302
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,890
United States issued only 65,000 h1b
visas for 2007

303
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,110
and the demand for them so great by
August 2006

304
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,440
they'd all been claims to compensate for
hesitation to accept foreign hackers

305
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,209
into our midst we would have to ramp up
our domestic cultivation the species

306
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,459
but when the need is greatest our
society has steadily reduced its

307
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,150
tolerance for non conformity

308
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,380
creative mister Packers for those of us
who live in Boston we know this all too

309
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,680
well

310
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,470
January 2007 Pierburg of ski and Sean
Stevens were arrested in Boston

311
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,610
and charges of placing a hoax device
firm and

312
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:31,460
for attaching magnetically backed LED
light displays featuring characters in

313
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,420
cartoon Aqua Teen Hunger Force

314
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,980
on the Boston University and Longfellow
bridge is prompting the city to shut

315
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,920
down the bridges

316
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,260
the MBTA red line and Massachusetts
Massachusetts General Hospital

317
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,070
the city was unapologetic about having
your own easily identify these devices

318
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,409
malevolence

319
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:51,090
Police Commissioner Davis said the stunt
was quote unconscionable

320
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,480
in a post-9/11 era eight months later in
nineteen year old

321
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,690
MIT engineering undergraduate name star
simpson was arrested at gunpoint

322
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,540
by state police after wearing into
Boston Logan International Airport

323
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,240
a homemade name tag consisting of a
breadboard with LED lights

324
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,580
and a battery she created for MIT career
day

325
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,199
she was arrested on charges of
possession a hoax device

326
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,410
again the police were unapologetic
saying they were quote shocked

327
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,470
and appalled that she wore to an airport
and post-9/11 era

328
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,780
a major in state police unhesitatingly
explained had she not fall the saltines

329
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:32,210
instructions to the T when they held her
at gunpoint she would have been killed

330
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,240
a month earlier in New Haven Connecticut
a social running club called Hash House

331
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,140
Harriers

332
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,720
ran afoul of police the tradition at
this club is to have their

333
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,940
runs marked out by two members who run
in advance the pack

334
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,950
curing ordinary baking flour

335
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,020
and they let the left trailed behind
them for others to follow as they ran

336
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,480
through the local Ikea parking lot

337
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,790
when a customer reported two men
sprinkling white powder in the parking

338
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,399
lot

339
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,760
the achille shut down and evacuated what
police in bomb squad officials determine

340
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,590
the nature

341
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,790
at the white powder the two lead runners
for China inform police

342
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,540
it was baking flour and that they had
left it they were charged with a felony

343
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,080
city spokeswoman explained: they acted
irresponsibly in doing something they

344
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,790
knew

345
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,120
could have instilled fear

346
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,400
the patterns this in this post-9/11 era

347
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,830
citizens are asked to be ever vigilant
if you see something

348
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:28,300
say something as the maxim goes and you
have amateurs on your security front

349
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,430
lines and naturally follows the security
reports receiver amateurish

350
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:36,430
the government agents in receipt have an
ill-informed security assessment

351
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,230
as a choice disregarding its for
escalating its as it stands he is

352
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,010
incentivized to escalate

353
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,090
as ours immediate superiors and so forth

354
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,659
at the end the incident after ridiculous
quantities of money in man hours have

355
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,290
been spent to determine there was no
threat to begin with

356
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,720
the blame falls upon the nonconformist
lacking

357
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,310
unexpected manner for having the
temerity to confound

358
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,510
and trick the system security analyst
Bruce Schneier first this pattern

359
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,420
as the war on the unexpected is part of
a culture of fear

360
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,580
poorly calculated risk assessments as
well known advice

361
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:15,169
just refuse to be terrorist

362
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,780
star simpson will probably go on to
become a brilliant engineer with a

363
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,510
magnificent career

364
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,490
she censored now she colors inside the
lines a little bit more

365
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,820
she hacks a bit less because she
wouldn't want her hack to be confused as

366
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,710
a bomb

367
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,200
again if we culturally smother
environment

368
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,920
in which creative nonconformity
celebrated will smother the joy that

369
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,040
happen again if you get rid of one

370
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,750
you get rid of the other and again if
you provide enough official

371
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,900
discouragement

372
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,190
hacker may just decide to give up
packing

373
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,340
hackers now an endangered species its
habit has been threatened

374
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:54,449
is anticipating John Adams wrote that a
constitutional government wants change

375
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,760
from freedom can never be restored
Liberty once lost

376
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,340
is lost forever because %uh this the
Free Software Foundation is reinvent

377
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,419
itself

378
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:08,140
to fill them to fill the to join the
ranks the rave organizations defending

379
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,290
the beleaguered hacker

380
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,550
as fragile environment digital
restrictions management technologies

381
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,360
steel

382
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,960
from hackers the raw materials they need
for cultural and technological

383
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,340
innovation

384
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,540
these digital raw materials feed and
nourish the hacker intellect

385
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,290
and so the Free Software Foundation
launched it affected by design can't

386
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,450
we injected into public discourse the
stern this concept

387
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,510
that a product with the RM is
fundamentally defective

388
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:34,510
and broken by intent

389
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:39,010
the fix is free and the foundation joins
a coalition partners the quest to and

390
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,520
software patents

391
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,629
Pat for patton the fundamental building
blocks in our trade

392
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,340
and limiting their exercise to be
empowered an established insures

393
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,270
environment

394
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,670
which bad ideas and bats offer products
will win

395
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,100
the FSF rally to show the world that
Microsoft Windows Vista restricted

396
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,180
freedom even more unnecessarily than
previous versions

397
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,760
the free software offered a different
path through and through our efforts

398
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,570
even average customers have been
refusing to purchase computers running

399
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,929
year's best

400
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,570
there'll be more campaigns to come and
more fights for the Free Software

401
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,310
Foundation

402
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,080
lead and across the world will continue
to lead the defense the hacker the most

403
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,230
ethical an active manners

404
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:19,990
what is required of us we had hers on
planet Earth

405
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,460
is to refuse to be terrorist to hack as
if it is natural and divine

406
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,110
to do so to find ever more creative ways
to resist

407
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,780
and parity the culture of fear and
intolerance that threatens to eradicate

408
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,899
our species

409
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,940
thank you for coming thank you for
hacking

410
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:44,940
and take your time

411
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:48,780
I think that I was getting much larger
times lower than expected so

412
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,330
if came if we can bring out the lights
anymore have to take any questions

413
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,810
anybody has any criticisms or anything
on this or

414
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:03,810
wash

415
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,549
name

416
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,339
okay city but have any questions
comments

417
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:20,099
criticisms blames trolls not

418
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:24,729
please enjoy your police up

419
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:28,559
I'm not

420
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,559
just

421
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:04,210
used

422
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:04,920
okay

423
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:10,340
which

424
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,738
he's

425
00:24:10,739 --> 00:24:17,739
its you

426
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:27,560
us

427
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,169
well I would suggest that saddam

428
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,980
at least with the strength of the
constitution that we've been found it

429
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,460
with you probably have a pretty good
bulwark against

430
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:43,460
a complete and total fashion shipped up

431
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,330
I think the hacker I think that hackers
necessarily are probably in

432
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,830
excellent position to help reverse that
trend mostly because we have

433
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,759
the building to lampoon things better
than other people on

434
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,320
ands any sort love clever

435
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,590
and visible demonstration

436
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,918
thats whatever the current trends that
weird

437
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,980
in disagreement with that restrict our
abilities to

438
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,100
express ourselves and to create the
culture that we want to create

439
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,639
if we can point out there ridiculousness
in a

440
00:25:20,639 --> 00:25:23,690
visible and creative way tends to be a
lot more effective

441
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,799
and definitely our culture

442
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,668
are our particular culture has grasped
onto some the examples today

443
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,409
but I outlined as perfect am
demonstrations love where

444
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,480
good sense failed to do the right thing

445
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,509
where extreme announcer overreaction
paranoia and fear

446
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,149
where the incentivize was

447
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:50,159
reaction by the system that we

448
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,440
want people to overreact and that if
they under react

449
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,489
and try to show sense tried to show

450
00:25:56,489 --> 00:26:00,549
restrain to try to show temperance that
our system actually punishes them for

451
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:01,269
having done so

452
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:05,489
I'm so definitely through a

453
00:26:05,489 --> 00:26:10,029
groundswell from the hacker community I
think it's probably possible to

454
00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:14,129
reengineer that system so that the
incentive is for thought

455
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:21,129
rather than got reaction

456
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:28,640
in

457
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,260
its

458
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:35,780
is

459
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,910
his he is definitely a master that pic

460
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:45,910
minced

461
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,350
i think is i think is def an excellent

462
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:53,620
place I'm sorry say again

463
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:58,259
I think the United States has

464
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,840
a unique originating point in terms of
providing a culture which

465
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,159
supports the creativity Packers and I
think that the

466
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,950
the the status quo over the last

467
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,350
20 years 25 years that's

468
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,950

469
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,330

it started from such a high plateau
freedom on

00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:35,940
any sort of deviation from that plateau
eyes for more visible
