1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,449
or packing international networks and
systems using boy

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,570
and I guess can anybody identify with
these

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,890
all tiny things are her yeah

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,000
perfect alright very good now

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,449
what's this thing up to

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,810
for right so

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,470
traditionally love you believe that you
can't really use

8
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,038
modems and VoIP adapters very well
together

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,329
because there's a lot of the lot of
problems like

10
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,059
are two problems and

11
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:40,260
compression things dropping out

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,920
you know just became making the carrier
try to you

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,190
just sit there and try to renegotiate
over and over and over again

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,339
and you know that's for things that we

15
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:54,489
you I worked under try to solve an

16
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:57,820
bus the site you use modems and right
was it was a senate

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,010
thing I everybody fucks everything up
the internet now

18
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,220
right yeah name drops a carrier rail so

19
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,560
but there's some ways you can actually
fix this that you can actually there

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,050
some variables that you can

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:12,590
said that'll make your connections to a
little bit better and

22
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,010
that's like missiles I'm mike was

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,010
this yeah well here words show

24
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,110
value actually I don't have a whole
bunch video and stuff right after year

25
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,770
to kinda enjoy and a good cuz I mean
really

26
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,130
you really can do modems over VoIP and
was really taken about it as you can get

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:32,500
in

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,510
good speeds 28a

29
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:42,460
got 33 secs and yes my

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,720
NZ bowlers in the MU

31
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,800
emulation that's not my name alright

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,200
anyway surgeons even still get maintain

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,630
really fast network adapter modem
connections now

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,500
where can we go this year disc with that
as you can see would

35
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,830
were displaying all the BBS is that
still exist in Texas

36
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:12,460
are actually the best texts yes are and
alright so you have to have

37
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,550
arm compression this able to have to do
something like new law or a law

38
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,550
something that's you know yes some socks
yes

39
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,980
GSM wow absolutely kill so

40
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,519
up some adapters

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,140
%uh they have a special setting for fax
machines sale da-lite star 9 I'm

42
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,270
an account set up the modem in a pre
configuration so that you can send a fax

43
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,600
over it I like the PAP to be the star 99
and that automatically disable

44
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,180
echo cancellation but if you're adapter
doesn't do this

45
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,270
then you can I'm you know mainly going
into we get

46
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,960
and of course use a provider that you
have good latency between

47
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,920
as guess it's possible to insist in %um
prefer we're not dropping every other

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,220
for compacted like for example for

49
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,370
toll-free project for you know for
provider based on have

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,580
was in France earners someplace

51
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,530
yes some place in Europe and so we have
to the transgenic Lake

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,010
which is always constant so you're
always going to constantly

53
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,859
see going on there so evens things out
and then of course

54
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,870
miss you put ATM at K that you

55
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,420
the modem all the times you can use
their correction and what not to help

56
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,620
you get maintaining

57
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,650
a good solid connection but you wanna
you but what to eat yet k does it

58
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,860
actually turns off

59
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,340
data compression you don't need a
compression in a compressed during

60
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,620
I just makes things worse alright

61
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,920
and then there's some variables that you
just can't arm really address was no

62
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,959
eighty Command said arm like if you're
dialing into India

63
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,860
for example today have across doctor

64
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,190
removal I I've have heard

65
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,480
so what can you do so when are we gonna
modem hooked up

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,620
and what the hell you do that we're
gonna call well

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,690
you coulda you could look some stuff up
to the modem

68
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,130
maybe you it could pick up a credit card
machine caller boy that would be a

69
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,220
terrible idea

70
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,730
arm you could you know maybe start a BBS
some

71
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,919
not do very much for that

72
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,270
arm you see him but he still has a BF so
that all packer BB once I don't know yes

73
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,120
yes I for absolute yes absolutely

74
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,409
so you could do that um but there's an
entire world out there OVA

75
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:34,319
you know above below people don't
typically go outside of the United

76
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,120
States so there's lots of other things
that I love their

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,590
so and i won that's but Wenger

78
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,830
exactly as you are sick TiVo & right
right

79
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,998
so my right

80
00:04:51,999 --> 00:04:55,860
correct arm now the connections are you
making on exactly

81
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,800
you know lights be but we're not doing
PPP when I'm trading where's the

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,069
downloading porn its

83
00:05:01,069 --> 00:05:04,550
text and or I don't know any

84
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,409
X 25 diverting porn but I

85
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:12,248
so list see what we have here these are
mostly non

86
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:15,719
I P typically networks that we

87
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:19,248
typically play on I think the next one
is the

88
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:22,669
I'll so going to a forty-five so

89
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:26,430
basically um one thing that means a
caucus are talking about america the

90
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,300
spill a lot about

91
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,809
X 95 networks like tellin adn time and
stuff like that

92
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:33,830
said cash and would not be restored
until those out there

93
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,169
kinda thinking you know about it royal
are these numbers for

94
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:42,770
around you know syrup seventies early in
Irvine throughout the entire eighties

95
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,808
right now we used to call you know a
single PC pursuits

96
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:51,759
and I you know I

97
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,230
I know it's the you know you drop 20
bucks a month and

98
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,360
in during the off hours between 6 p.m.
to 7 a.m.

99
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,430
you be able to call do have calls for
other out I'll modems

100
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,860
and order places places like you know
New York

101
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,140
Chicago Denver Seattle I'll

102
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,010
all these different places so you
connect to pound

103
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:21,010
the Sprint network Telenet you we've Rd
dialed all the Sprint numbers

104
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,670
and they are gone your other X 25

105
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:30,390
I think you might be right yeah um so
it's also being a user

106
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,190
it's also being used to allow the
country's princes like in India and what

107
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,510
not

108
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,940
they already have that network
infrastructure in place so it gives them

109
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,590
a means

110
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,270
like on I wanna providers they use the
next 25 network

111
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,169
to piggyback PPP connections and stuff
like that to get

112
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,500
you know citizens and whatnot onto the
internet since the piggybacking

113
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,080
by the department at the very put the
money into the infrastructure so

114
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,320
right you know it's just a matter love
sexually

115
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,740
and X 25 network serving multiple the
used for all kinds of interesting things

116
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,540
banking corporate systems

117
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,570
ATM's a of course gotta everybody likes
to talk about that

118
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,190
so um let's see what's out there um

119
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:14,480
no I'm sorry I love these networks arm
have a quick hooked up and they're not

120
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,640
usually terribly secured very well

121
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,930
we've seen some Gottlieb and stuff right
comes

122
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,480
year you know they think its own excited
by that work that nobody knows about

123
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,040
so why put a password on that router I'm

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,140
yesterday but this is next 25 Takamine

125
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,330
work or just touching on it real quick
you know just touch on sotheby's

126
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,840
terminology you when you use X 25
networks as opposed to

127
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,300
you know like a X 25 where everybody has
a and he and see which is our patent and

128
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,040
they all talk whatever on river
Telephone

129
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,140
X 25 years next 28 which is called a pad

130
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,370
in Sencha Touch your little

131
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,560
based point and then that talks X 25 you

132
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,180
it's a good monica mayhem table for
reader better

133
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,230
addresses to connect to other machines
within that particular network

134
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,620
yeah do in a way I I would think it's
more like what we believe you

135
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,330
like explains the PPP to talking to TCP

136
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,349
in a way wouldn't

137
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,360
so but one

138
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,450
so you call these X 25 networks

139
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,539
and seven IP address you have in any way
and at

140
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,120
network user dress to strength in
numbers

141
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,810
thing for fixed by the neck

142
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:38,540
annualized server essentially

143
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,559
the log you into the network that you
only as passwords

144
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,460
right they are always necessary a lot of
systems are

145
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,130
will let you connect and use their
network without any more I but then

146
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,090
what you're connected the systems
connected on that X 25 network

147
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:56,940
if bob may or may not let you connect
based on

148
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,810
the fact if you have any are you don't
have any I and D Nick

151
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,700
in X 25 network mister you have

152

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,770
frances if you can ignore months ago
like a area code kinda because you know

156
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,600
it easier

157
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,210
310 is working again i think is at 3201

158
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,280
well anyways so the first three numbers
will be the

159
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,750
country and then the last typically be
use for identifying

160
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,160
other networks but the first three so
you know it country up almost

161
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,819
every country has a denike associated
with it like these TX right

162
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,910
you can see I China the 460

163
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,020
and then if 46 0.003s China pack

164
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,540
so these are all the different X 25 I
mean the list is

165
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,680
absolutely huge so we just included a
few

166
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,930
so com so here we're gonna show a little
video

167
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,280
love arm we can actually connect up to

168
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:18,280
and I think they're still if you're
around

169
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,010
so this in Japan

170
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,470
we haven't really explored this on that
much I am

171
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,140
we don't really know a lot about that so
anything to you find all these weird

172
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:31,790
networks

173
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,880
and it's sometimes hard to find any
documentation on them

174
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,500
or you find these you know I am to find
out how they're being used or what

175
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,660
they're being used for

176
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,150
and usually have any Google my opinion
that's me. lotta stuff we found is

177
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,160
of Google essentially and you know you
might find like

178
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,339
one place one application that might
give you

179
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:56,020
login to you just two their service

180
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,839
right and the networks tend to be used
for various things some but that

181
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,080
summer movie or more of like banking and
stuff like that

182
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,720
arm other ones are large corporations

183
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,970
to like them though

184
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,130
and this is actually connecting to the
pad um make their

185
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,370
is the in Newark man but I didn't
specify any idea that I wanted to use it

186
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,730
is wanted to show

187
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,770
how you do it so as you can see when
you're connecting up to pat is gonna

188
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,680
give you disagree command where

189
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,990
to get connected now this all night here
%uh

190
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,380
is in South South Africa man as you can
see it doesn't even let you on

191
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,680
right up front I this one just died

192
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,270
bike you probably can't dial into this
network anymore

193
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:43,800
on their skills Australia and the
government used it a lot and that is

194
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,500
recently shut it down

195
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I'm actually you can probably still dial
into it

196
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,260
I am just some

197
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,220
something many problems and you can see
that there's a a difference in

198
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,850
for each country because usually these
networks so did the Spaniard our country

199
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,160
do have Propst better you know sir
fitting

200
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,430
towards a too much now

201
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,780
on this one Illmatic you doing the
second man cuz that this trend

202
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,980
good some help from the pad what we do
here

203
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,930
is on this particular network will have
these testing you is that you can

204
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,310
connect to

205
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,830
on issues for testing out your terminal
connection to announce whatever you type

206
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,610
in Canada like Iraq

207
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,430
now that's not very interesting in
itself me give you an idea of the in

208
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,660
the way the way it's structured like you
can see from here but

209
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,709
I can look at that and now I might be
able to use that move future to skin out

210
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:39,850
the rest the network to see what other
systems are up there

211
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:45,339
so

212
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,800
and I might be made to these videos
along

213
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,280
yeah i think is almost done with your
I'm

214
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,410
so as you can see from and remember this
is all over

215
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:02,020
room I'll it's really easy to dial into

216
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,199
all these final networks and

217
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,250
risk i showing limited had stuff in just
a

218
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,680
actually connecting um this land use for

219
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,170
a air transport communications used by
airliners

220
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,020
I think I pack cheese and yes I actually
I think we can make that

221
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,140
see some using exit is a public access
Nuri

222
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,870
that I people use to connect up to this
ISP in hong kong

223
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,560
now so I logged in gonna do it in USA

224
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,240
pain at the wrong in Ewing gonna yeah

225
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,690
must see what it does here

226
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,120
okay so we can make up to Hong Kong we
get this nice little PPP connection

227
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,959
you see it very top there I think I
actually highlighted a second

228
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:51,430
I am missus car connected to you

229
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,980
that's it's kind of taking the in its
redirecting the original in the way that

230
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,380
I could and and and connecting it to
that

231
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,980
back in USA so basically using that I
can now

232
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,990
and I know more about the network
connecting the good actually scan a

233
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,200
little bit more

234
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:11,160
that park right up there so I think a
disconnect to it

235
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,579
and I've never actually tried to make a
few key connection to the server

236
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,750
no click here moody PPP over break to
Hong Kong

237
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,990
that sounds like such a brilliant idea
but I've done

238
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,270
much silliest us its

239
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:34,270
I think some sources were

240
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,760
and reforms in India and remember that
picture that I showed you what their

241
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,810
fun for mines it is incredibly difficult
to connect

242
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:48,360
so I just took a screener and this is
british telecommunications and use a lot

243
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,470
for banking

244
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,040
arm and is owned by the same I actually
is but yet so amazing company he did a

245
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,199
time that i believe isn't excellent
United

246
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:01,980
so it's good to see in your personal

247
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,600
doing what the next week 5 and that's
another interesting thing to those

248
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
people all over

249
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,380
like we run into Russian hackers you're
doing was kinda stuff

250
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,410
and on their own networks a

251
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:19,410
and across the world this another place
that was hard to connect to

252
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,110
%um did you get this is a corporate this
is actually a private

253
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,319
arm network on by Quest

254
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:30,660
so they were actually X 25 networks in
america

255
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:37,660
believe it or not and I think we're
almost in Austria

256
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,850
ropa

257
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,510
already

258
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,670
so buying this stuff yeah absolutely

259
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,439
arm like for I nets you know usually
largest country still have

260
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:59,680
basically maybe like three digits like
you know be common to re-

261
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
eight hundred-number 301

262
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,180
640 X 411 of Oregon I am

263
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,370
to call into x Hunter x Hunter packet

264
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,610
turns 25 network and three digit dialing
doesn't work for international calls

265
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,660
so we were having a look for while a
direct-dial

266
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,730
into their network so for for India X
for example

267
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:26,650
essentially went to their phone
directory now India

268
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,550
on have any recollection idea but well
you go to a website up there

269
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,860
and you can actually drill-down all the
doubters City

270
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,870
in typing note show officer in the Royal
University of

271
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,290
yea Taipei

272
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,160
you know dialer to show everything
everything has a dialer notation

273
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,760
their phone directory allow this to look
at an amazing right actually it was

274
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,410
kinda funny

275
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,790
I'm you go to a place in search for a
moment it is give you all the dialup

276
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,690
that's awesome

277
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:59,550
um the up I'll so items you can to
search for you know key terms

278
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:03,540
dunno dial-up modem X but 28 had or X 28

279
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,459
Russia and then a lot and you can find
these or you'll find other hacking

280
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,180
groups like

281
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,730
getting together and talking about it
and giving the numbers to each other so

282
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,510
anything under them and it really helps
to use the localized version

283
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,859
because it does your preference to
whatever language

284
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,060
break trying to explore alright so

285
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,510
now that we're connected to the network
we can star

286
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,660
you know working for other things are
connected up to the network

287
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,930
so he can you think of a near a scanner
and it's pretty straightforward

288
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,470
the idea is to you taken on in PA

289
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,400
and then you increments the in you a
number so since they are targets

290
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,580
we know some things that well you know
ten thousand well try 10001 10002 pretty

291
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,560
straightforward stuff

292
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,020
um and also the research what's been
done there

293
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:58,100
you know 10 years back the eighties we
wrote a lot of the

294
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,440
musings lot of text files are are out
there and

295
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,180
on information is fees we still valid 11

296
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,300
date exp I think there's one article and
frack

297
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,490
were actually has a must've anyways

298
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,980
and you know in this game you just saw
the network running so

299
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,730
trust mouth I you very surprised

300
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,220
absolutely arm and thing to remember

301
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,600
about bad and you wise is or any wiser
allow you to make

302
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,430
mister like a calling card essentially
you know you login

303
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:34,970
you're actually pay for that call or you
can make o'clock call

304
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,410
just by Dorling your buttons 0 your D
neck

305
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,020
and then the address that you and in you
a text when I look at

306
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,190
that actually works meeting like

307
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,480
a lot like the phone system there is
that the situation where when you're

308
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,690
calling another computer system by in
your way

309
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,070
they have to accept the charges for that
call and

310
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,110
some places actual say we're will leave

311
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,330
I refuse you know refused to call
together then you know right away

312
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,530
there's something there

313
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,399
but it wants me to login and I don't
really have a login so I guess I'll be

314
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,570
seeing what kind of legacy years on that

315
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:10,700
South year and then you know

316
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,840
likes you know like for data pack

317
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,199
every place has a topology hack and a
guys day

318
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,660
they really mapped out under X 25
network and

319
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,950
you can by they have broken down by

320
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,200
gave by city by city nursing your or

321
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,080
province or whatever you want own and
you can see I

322
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,280
US sixty you

323
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,580
I a

324
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,330
essentially just you look at you can say
that

325
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,310
anything that's inside with just do you
feel energy x-ray

326
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:55,700
we have an Ontario your exactly and

327
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,800
the scanner yeah as they come were such
dorks that we actually write software to

328
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,899
scan these networks

329
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,130
and this is one of our pieces of work
and this is i doing that one and I'm

330
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,330
Germany um know it takes forever to
connect remember

331
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,540
to skip to the middle area as well looks
like

332
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,000
real here yes Stephens Kevin said

333
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,400
goes really fast unfortunately this
network computer

334
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,620
for invalid Muaz disconnection have some
networks you can connect it to you know

335
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,740
this let you stay on indefinitely by Ca

336
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,010
the Russian network which I actually
meant to put a video in here for

337
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,310
but he sees is trying to connect to man
dropping off

338
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:36,830
but is goes to sequentially looking for
ballot systems

339
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,840
wanna minutes then just keep on going

340
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,050
but it does so fast I mean it's not like
ecstasy to let it burn

341
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,639
if you can remain connected for any
length of time at the russian that work

342
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,780
you can connect up you can stay on for a
couple hours if you want scanning their

343
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,320
network

344
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,189
an atypical any don't want drop you and
then your the spine weird little

345
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,880
interesting things arm it is

346
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,429
as you can see it is and it's blurry

347
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:09,810
minutes I'm

348
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,040
media oh yeah alright so what else can
you do levels you know

349
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,149
so we doing some X 25 started you know
fairly interesting

350
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,990
so what else can you do here mom um

351
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,630
community guess what is going on here
this is something traditionally eighties

352
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,110
but there's a software that I've written

353
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,280
oh my god

354
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,560
period sup arm you have this

355
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,899
VoIP connection you can make extremely
cheap calls

356
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,720
to anywhere in the world you can get
where this is going on in Seattle seen a

357
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,350
more complete really like that future

358
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,330
I'm anyway that's not well the stock but
he was a a

359
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,340
um sure you can log yes to or my own
software

360
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,740
so this is a piece of work on I wore
that a I rope a few years ago

361
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,580
and it does a lot of the same features
that i'm open all that which are

362
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,590
awesome om and

363
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,100
I so you know this but connection you do
tons a cheap calls

364
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,690
I'm I might that is 61 prism but it's
all fake numbers

365
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:16,690
has gone to them

366
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,360
in yeah litigate me

367
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,570
he said well you know centrally you have
all these VoIP providers

368
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,710
an were talking for lie you know you

369
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,720
tempat were 10 what we're paying euros

370

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,080
I and you lobby space we even have

374
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,620
list two countries like 20-30 countries
that you can call for free

375
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,230
and I mean there's certain restrictions

376
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,140
certain restrictions to it he has been
landlines you think you can we call

377
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,410
your you can only be spectrum 300
minutes every week

378
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,970

379
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:10,690
how come and and you know you could but
these are places around the world I mean

talking like

381
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,590
fractions with Penny if you call
someplace like Iran

382
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,709
you know which is which missing is not
anybody's friendly list

383
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,300
yeah maybe not for you but knows

384
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,860
I think a big thing to hear is that dumb

385
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,890
american boy providers systems is

386
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,460
ones in Europe for that like for
instance as he was pointing out

387
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,470
um Iran are you know

388
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,510
we decided we wanted I'll Iran a lot

389
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:43,690
and we didn't want to go through an
American company for some

390
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,900
mysterious reason so we decided to I use
European providers that wouldn't you

391
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,550
know

392
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,220

so this is actually with homework what
it's about the shipping

407
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,280
I am wanna when the things I wasn't oh
mike was

408
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,389
thing called on maps and I'm not sure if

409
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,720
many few many people remembered or not
but

410
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,330
kinda gives a graphical representation
what

411
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,600
some these prefixes in outside outside
United States have

412
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,980
I am kinda go into one here so

413
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,190
person a map a the kremlin there

414
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,480
basically the prefix area for creme

415
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,400
and you can see with the yellow dots
corn starch or whatever

416
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,510
those are the actual carriers and red
busy

417
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,720
your not connecting whatever some
grazing their butts

418
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,159
you know you can see density a modem
yeah it's kinda weird can sometimes is

419
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,370
your you look at the store maps and then
you must be a pic now

420
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:38,440
like a weird pattern over maybe it was
like a big dialup or for some company

421
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,010
your

422
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,810
or something like that I can lower
senators you there sir dyno to each

423
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:44,120
other each other

424
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,880
chance to properly select media a
cluster something right there

425
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,220
release within those two 100 blocks

426
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,960
Mac on this one was a

427
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,480
Napa buckingham palace's prefix

428
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,560
the he did on the 4th July cuz you
thought it was appropriate

429
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,879
on with you see there's a lot more modem
activity there

430
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,110
lotta stuff that was actually in those
were

431
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,050
Morgan if we found um building
management systems

432
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:18,510
arm and dial-a-porn rules

433
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,510
you know all kindsa routers that for got
to have passwords

434
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,260
on them yes like that

435
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,000
up

436
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,400
I

437
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,210
arm I'm not sure you have to catch a ask
which a moss

438
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,290
right I like the Yorker that asshole and

439
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:45,908

others were

442
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,860
home accent trouble servers

443
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,110
for those trips I think I found one

444
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:06,110
in there that was like a a secure back
said

445
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,640
as I was identified itself feels that
included faxing

446
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,140
was weird yeah them some

447
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,909
you know zimbabwe not to me but answers

448
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:22,830
me what to your three but does Kimball
is that the one that came up with

449
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,990
the take BBS now workers at the
different country yes to a day a week a

450
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,320
calling a person bob way and it said

451
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,000
too loud and I BBS in the new Thai PBS
and then introduced

452
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,120
set her up on you so I guess their BBS
was down

453
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
and his I really am as you can see it's

454
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,990
for you pretty right yeah I think I
think Tim Cason

455
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,650
allotted lot of countries that don't use
Roman

456
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,900
Roman alphabet rome-based alphabet is
that

457
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,030
from United didn't have the character
set for

458
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,158
so like he's probably out Baxter she's

459
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,540
and while here's a carrier knows have
fun with carriers

460
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,580
I think that's that I remember we didn't
really go follow dal

461
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,990
your quite a bit done with a ramp

462
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:14,770
we were looking for things um and then
Israel just about things out right

463
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,929
because we didn't want to just begun I
am

464
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:22,310
so we did Israel for a while and you can
see where you at a black carriers are

465
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:26,200
where haven't called and integrators are
the ones that actually have

466
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,390
in Jan did those as an example love

467
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,980
well you know you see a few their
starting lineup and just really

468
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,760
try calling their really expands out

469
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,990
as far as you know pedestrian modems

470
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,429
and actually world take some cue enable
you actually have a question for you

471
00:28:44,429 --> 00:28:45,530
guys

472
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:52,530
because we're not if anybody knows what
the hell this thing as

473
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,330
what is a BIOS command string

474
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,550
as anybody here seen this thing I'm
serious we don't know what it is

475
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:05,428
so you and that's just that's that's
open this is

476
00:29:05,429 --> 00:29:08,560
nuclear actin this work presents just
don't know what to do

477
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,040
what they want from us

478
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,540
well I mean I just was in

479
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,740
UK

480
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,330
its seeing

481
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,770
in that's when the fun things to you
find all these obscure things like we

482
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,918
could even find and freaking

483
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,980
Google very much about this damn thing
so

484
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,080
its yeah global significance I

485
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,720
um anyways %uh were open for any kind of
qana

486
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,780
and any questions if you have any

487
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,240
a the profit

488
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,899
your were trying

489
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:59,570
I for yet their arm environmental
control systems that are still using

490
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,139
dollop modems love them I think that's
what that place where I think that's

491
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,409
what this is

492
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:07,480
yeah was there looking at those things
with a

493
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,960
make Rep

494
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:20,500
interesting expense

495
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,890
yes yes

496
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,300
um were using mostly

497
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,980
this committee call boy buster that will
use the occasion because they don't seem

498
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,159
to care how many times

499
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,330
we'd I'll make some companies you know
like new phone though probably notice if

500
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,070
you don't know

501
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,370
8,000 numbers and gonna get pissed arm

502
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,380
but some companies I guess we bust is
one of them which it doesn't seem to

503
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,560
mind but I wouldn't recommend it with
them

504
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,010
I am was the same this is just another
one that

506
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:01,750
I mean this essentially a cedar going

507
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,620
doubt 0 and it's just sort of openers
just bring

508
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,880

about them

518
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,159
um you find a lot of the old legacy

519
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,840
old you would sometimes even apply call
backs is beings are

520

on those 625 networks so it's that's a
great range some stuff that you dislike

542
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,669
what the hell is this

543
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:28,679

now not not very much so I'm

558
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,679
typically I think like for instance in
your they'd ever met for

559
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:27,839
us here in the United States guild
connected to the network and probably

560
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,449
don't want us to be able to connect to
network

561
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:33,850
sorry had actually do a lot of research
to find the modem for actual G Falcon

562
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:37,810
had to do a research

563
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:44,339
oh yeah then you'd be calm yeah

564
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,109
right right thing you'd probably be gone
yeah

565
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:52,639
confirm

566
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,639
a home what's up to about 1.0 out the
refering mean

567
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,359
it could very well be

568
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,390
ok the Big Ten's

569
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,000
right go

570
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,170
to try someplace more

571
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,460
going to change the search and guided
I'm

572
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:24,910
be with him how much time 6

573
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,930
sorry where his

574
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,200
its

575
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:39,200
trick to research and they actually
still call into some BBS is

576
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,430
and but they're kinda fun to read is
always like to all guys who are still

577
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,149
calling and chatting with each other

594
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,140
we've done

595
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,160
really silly over weapons anybody %uh

596
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,730
run in TP servers by any chance okay

597
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:57,700
um have you ever played with the NTP has
a dialer function built into it

598
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:02,200
so you can dial into the and I S T and
they still run their dialup so you can

599
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,339
see where this is going

600
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:07,450
you configure a bigger avoid the call
their to get your time

601
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,049
any become a stratum on server which is
gonna ridiculous because the latency and

602
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:11,530
whatnot

603
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:14,710
