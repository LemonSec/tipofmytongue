1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,110
of to people and two machines lying to
me she's involves

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,440
lots a different techniques or poisoning

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,480
is an effective way to end the set
traffic

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,330
Smith hijack das network connections it
is more effective way of hijacking

5
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,119
connections

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,640
because it allows you to see incoming
outgoing

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,630
traffic in cleartext now HD mobile the
point

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,820
3 a tumour stated that the other two
hundred fifty servers

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,710
about ISP was still vulnerable after
they fix Metasploit dot com

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,570
so two things either they didn't hear

11
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,360
where they said the other two hundred
and fifty servers are retarded so we're

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,210
not gonna fix it

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,230
that's embarrassing and if anybody knows

14
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,320
ISP provider please let me know after
because I never wanna

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,660
cause my website with them hmm

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,640
up attacks here we have a simple diagram
a farm spoofing

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,930
corporate executives and manages think
that this attack can happen again

18
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,140
until they on the front page of The Wall
Street Journal

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,939
any other media outlet like security
focus and they say oh you should

20
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,110
I'm out of a job basically so

21
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,140
here on the bottom you see and easy we

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,790
in by using either cap you could easily
spooked server be

23
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,750
so when survey since the traffic the
attacker in a subset would too

24
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,100
them decisive forwarded on 23 and 24 to
server be

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,490
now are protect them all

26
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,310
first this kind human are attack I need
volunteer to come up here

27
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,280
regime and grey zone and in the crowd
somewhere

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,840
volunteer nada a prick who

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,259
any girls and women and no not you not
you many women levi's

30
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,329
no are now right

31
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:05,600
come up from up come up right here you

32
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,069
he said right of course we're gonna you
know use laptops and try to it

33
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,239
throughout awesome good yes what you
don't you know

34
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:16,280
because everybody pretty much knows how
this goes then

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,610
how easy it is is really easy to do it
want to do it in the human factor

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,780
I somehow be the spectator right now and
I'm gonna be too dark

37
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,129
spoofing alright through Avenue

38
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,209
job year he is server

39
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:34,230
K okay my brothers that at all I want
you to sit down

40
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,609
I want you to sit down gonna happen he
said that take a co-ed brothers them

41
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,860
so we survey my brothers

42
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,530
that attacker and the general we
shouldn't Adrian

43
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,239
adrian is serving be so at the survey
sent

44
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,430
a packet over to gym

45
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,629
he just in time for people money

46
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,879
the attacker and he's got a forward
about what had been a big way traffic

47
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,250
and he's not going to give a ten dollars
if you are going to give it a try

48
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,430
and again he handed me the character
arcs

49
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,510
to fit so now what you want to do is
probably said the password

50
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,819
hopefully a tamper Hazare you wanna flip
it over again

51
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:19,760
and he is gonna do it again

52
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,230
and he's gonna send it over now the last
word where he's going to do said

53
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,239
more money and

54
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,549
with him is going to do is he's gonna
decide that is kind of big got a lot of

55
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:33,989
money in it and is gonna die

56
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,739
us that job its connection is not going
to receive anything

57
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,739
but your other reports for the gentleman
you get to keep it

58
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,599
you get to keep it for a little
different a little different you don't

59
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,470
want to just usual stuff

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,000
gonna have another one coming up that's
a presentation

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,250
so free money given away

62
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,239
you know the economy Sarma so

63
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,780
architect medication so how do we
mitigate these risks not changing our

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,260
entries hmm I don't think so don't even
waste your time

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,540
this is too time-consuming is
unmanageable

66
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,478
on a big skill network you just kill all
your resources

67
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,680
DHCP snooping we covered is on the
latest live

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,630
art watch is open source software that
monitors

69
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,659
mmm computed the computer network

70
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,930
the net were for Arbor activity it
generates a lot of IP address mac

71
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,880
Address pairings

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,930
along with the times that

73
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,490
when the pairing appeared on the network

74
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,900
so I like it because it's free

75
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,030
anything free head I saw me who'd been

76
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,560
Mac living in camps able flu attacks

77
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,830
switches maintain the list qu kan tables

78
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,240
which is this yellow thing here this
enables

79
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,770
it to decent skews

80
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,400
in a name was it to send data to
physical port

81
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,160
where the recipient computers located

82
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,960
in a typical Mac flooding attack this
which is flooded with packets

83
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:22,620
each containing difference was mac
Address

84
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,940
so here which you see is just a recluse
which

85
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,389
its operating normally soapy one says
the it over to p2

86
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,180
mmm jus level conversation and here we
go

87
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,139
the attacker says the mac Address is
onto the switch

88
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,930
and he decides to flow the camp to you
and it starts broadcasting

89
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,490
just like i hav now

90
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,970
this is where the attack it's good I
shows Mac OS

91
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,750
businesses we were 0 sorry me

92
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,810
jobs Mac OS the flood this which were
random Agadir S's

93
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,729
causing the switch to fill open and
repeatable

94
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,060
he'd hit this is when you wanna have you
seen for running

95
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,350
okay so you just blast the network and
here you see a screen a

96
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,300
backtrack you could just slow to
backtrack in open up a prop hip

97
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,770
type a Mac OS ban it just us generated
packets on

98
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,780
on wire as you can see here now

99
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,770
the result the last like made the switch
to bleed out

100
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,750
which is def a local mall or incoming
packets were broadcasted

101
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,750
on throughout the switch and you can see

102
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,240
the user name password and so on and so
forth

103
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,319
and you can use Wireshark whatever you
prefer

104
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,669
I use came today because I like it and
you could just

105
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,758
catch more than just passwords is the
message in

106
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,699
and so on and so forth

107
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,440
so the medication for Mac flooding the
game tables it's not

108
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,370
is the same as a heart attack somewhat
mass which is like

109
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:08,180
Cisco an ortho gives you the opportunity
to set up protections

110
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,960
against an attack with limiting the mac
Address is to that poor

111
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,860
you can also set up a policy that the if
the poor guys too many back addresses

112
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,789
the fall is to shut it down write a lot
a nerd that made with an email

113
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:26,909
and release up to admit to find out

114
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,710
hmm

115
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,650
are a

116
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,760
the BACP starvation attack works by
broadcasting DHCP request to a spoof mac

117
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,440
Address

118
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,660
this is easily achieved with attacks
like yes Ennio gobbler

119
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,610
if enough requests a set that were
detected can exhaust the address space

120
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,960
available to the DHCP servers

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,140
for a period of time now

122
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,440
he used to use any a broadcasting DHCP
requests

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,750
was move mac Address is and tried to
exhaust the DHCP

124
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,270
I people who and here you just launched
an attack and he starts running

125
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,359
and the thing is my nieces eight years
old she's right over the years she could

126
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
easily just do this a big point and
click

127
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
and is that attack is that easy

128
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,880
that passed and edges generates a lot of

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,960
or the traffic on their requesting IP
addresses

130
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,060
and hope yes we do have a picture that

131
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,300
easy to resolve it

132
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,630
the Microsoft DHCP server which we were
running 2003

133
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,600
as well as I know its phone boo on 2000

134
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,350
I have been tested 2008 yep Windows
Server 2008

135
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,620
so are probably tested in and posted on
the block

136
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,990
but as you can see the scary thing about
this

137
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,410
is that once this is down once this has
crashed

138
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,199
you can set up a rogue server and

139
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,800
you could if a request comes in you give
them my IP address

140
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
but that the for Gateway as your own IP

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,280
and make the traffic start directing
through you which is kinda scary

142
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,680
and as you see it's 100 percent full
this is the Event Viewer

143
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,670
this is what's bad about this is that
even if you stop attacking

144
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,760
admin has to go to the box and restart
the service

145
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,460
which I think at two o'clock in the
morning that is now we can open

146
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,290
restarting

147
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,020
are a we got another them

148
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,400
and like I said is pointing quick so
what we do want to do

149
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,410
is we are to the ACP servers

150
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,510
right I think we should stand up for
this this money is the IP addresses

151
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:54,920
who wants IP addresses so if you want to
attack abuse any a that we just showed

152
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,880
you

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,390
and you run it kinda easy like pointing
cliff

154
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,360
so no no nobody wants to stand up so
what we gonna do

155
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,339
I don't know still 123 we just got %uh

156
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:10,970
cropping cubano ed

157
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,650
as you can see most to be picked it up
we did though it too far enough

158
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,230
just having fun you're dead

159
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,970
as you can see there are any more
dollars well

160
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,870
%uh is a little catch today's as you see
my brother

161
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,640
walking off stage well

162
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,640
the goody-goody right there you heard
here

163
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,670
are as you see my brother local stage he
is the Roanoke server

164
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,390
giving the IP addresses out because all
the IP addresses

165
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,710
are to a kids show you the ropes worries
going over their letter

166
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,950
give our IP addresses you know

167
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,170
gases for a house you know I'm just
trying to help

168
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,400
the economy out and put money back into
the comment

169
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,530
you know as george bush's money by the
way he gave it to me in a brew

170
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:11,370
yeah yeah yeah

171
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,080
yeah okay

172
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,960
alright the AC piece new big me

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,140
sweet new DHCP snooping

174
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,550
restricts TCP request but again guys

175
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,339
if you can have the money so your IT
manager

176
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:33,480
to upgrade the switches and guys if you
can so

177
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,410
this is a great way to make money you
can go to your clients and blast them

178
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,750
blasphemous a a look but I'm just saying
you should buy the switches of me

179
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,500
their party and you put your money on
this a great way to make money as well

180
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,130
and is is vulnerable because a lot of
small companies mid-size companies still

181
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,990
have these

182
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,700
all the equipment you can easily make
pretty good chunk

183
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,579
few consultants out there like myself so

184
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:06,770
women who

185
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:13,650
you with them

186
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:19,860
describes their don't know the most
obvious risks associated with CDP is

187
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,240
information leakage

188
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,190
these CDP Cisco discovery protocol

189
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,400
by the floor their turn on the CDP
communique some months one another via

190
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,680
clear texan on

191
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,970
authenticated by claiming to be a phone
in the tech can reserve some electrical

192
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:36,790
power

193
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:41,089
the night other ballot devices from
receiving

194
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:44,650
powered from the switch which is sad
present

195
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:48,459
your colleagues Inc gonna have any phone

196
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:52,600
and they could be upset at you another
CDP attack

197
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,250
that is still relevant is a
vulnerability in Cisco I was 12 2012 12

198
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,500
that too

199
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,260
which had no CDP announcements you can
receive

200
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,730
or the device available memory by
sending large amounts of

201
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,209
CDP neighbor announcements to the device

202
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:13,660
and as you could see we attack

203
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,959
a Cisco I US version 12 battle

204
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,140
which was vulnerable to the knowledge
services well

205
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,260
residing on the same network segment as
the target device

206
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,380
we flooded the switch as you can see
here we will pour to switch in a portent

207
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,329
we ran are you said he has the cable
attack

208
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:36,780
CDP attack as well and as you see is you
see memory

209
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,750
we're you wanna point to it memory
allocation here

210
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,750
so we we did that as well dude

211
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,640
and you know not what you could do

212
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,699
and it could be said about CDP you know

213
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
countermeasures is set turned to shit or

214
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,650
the question arises as wise turned on in
the first place

215
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,800
you know IP phones right now is very
popular

216
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,640
but CTP is its

217
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,730
you should have it on at all you know

218
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,190
at all so if anyone out there knows why

219
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,839
CBP's indispensable after did

220
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,220
wet

221
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,310
yeah I know I know that that's what I'm
saying I people's popular but

222
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:32,310
should be a popular blast that you know

223
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,100
alright so Anthony who wanna come

224
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,770
Michael you guys have been about

225
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:48,770
are

226
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,400
spanning tree protocol

227
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,520
allows you to build 'em three top
quality network

228
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,800
kinda looks like for making one speak up
OCR

229
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,190
the spanning tree protocol allows you to
set up a

230
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,330
look free top quality on your network
that

231
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:23,320
is analogous to look like three so just
to give it up for

232
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,380
ha spanning tree protocol attack look is

233
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,790
animal allows to an attacker to school

234
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,150
ridge's top-quality bridges

235
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,920
Hughes or which work all day two units

236
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,610
that broadcast out

237
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:46,070
to see who has the lowest I P when it
has the lowest I D is the root bridge

238
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,830
saw these attacks are really just
straight from your send me a man page

239
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,940
I just over them pretty quickly

240
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,180
you can send rock pig racing be use
basketball's them

241
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,430
you can claim the role which is very
dangerous thing

242
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,230
or claim another role as far as the top
quality is concerned

243
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,410
or one of the more damaging attacks in
the man in the middle with actor can

244
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,069
take place

245
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,740
you claim roles in the duo home type the
situation

246
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,760
I do when you have access to two
switches

247
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,630
what into or when switched on a wireless
network another switch and wireless

248
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,510
networking up to wireless cards

249
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:30,510
effectively perform the same type of
attack in a wireless type a scenario

250
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,250
in this example you see FTP sending
configuration the

251
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,660
now service time row using your senate

252
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:50,660
so it's very simple Justin

253
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,750
over

254
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,750
you ran out of money so

255
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,240
radio but we can simply think we should
be

256
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:17,240
service an hour

257
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,950
talk about mitigation years so spanning
tree functions should be too safe

258
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,300
worth pertains to us which you
definitely want

259
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,629
we r on fiscal Cisco

260
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,040
army whatever pertains to that type

261
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,850
with the to you now

262
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:52,780
so Cisco enable route comment

263
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:59,780
to enable that type of protection

264
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,400
multicast was attacked I just gloss over
the

265
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,220
pretty quick because it looks like we're
showing up on time

266
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:14,140
we have a landslide you of

267
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm not be

268
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,179
here

269
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,989
I think you did are that we have sorry
about that

270
00:18:22,989 --> 00:18:28,429
multicast allows you to do one too many
are many

271
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:31,759
too many using a single packet that gets
replicated throughout the network by

272
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,950
your gear

273
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,229
to be able to save on traffic so what an
attack would do with

274
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:41,519
spoke that in rapid succession a series
a multicast frames

275
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,849
friends with a week and other feel as if
they're not set up properly

276
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:52,849
sorta mitigation that you can use for
these

277
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:57,669
types of attacks are by more capable
switches

278
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:04,669
you could use the money that we put out
to the crowd to do that or service

279
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,659
earlier to multicast packets occurs

280
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,729
a constraint regular so no package to be
able to be

281
00:19:10,729 --> 00:19:13,940
across the line you can turn checked out
with TCP doubt

282
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:20,940
Wireshark net do pick up with the
philanthropy more

283
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:28,200
so this has the ability to an remove
dynamically

284
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,260
plans for the network so our client BTP
switches the race if the lens was

285
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,810
receiving the method

286
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:39,480
types of attacks you could do worse in
BTP packet

287
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,030
the lead RPT PV plant the League One
beware

288
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:47,860
or at one beware that's all run to a VTP
server on the network

289
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,520
which should have its own the land and
dedicated worker

290
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,500
how do you manage your that

291
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:01,090
against that well make sure that the BTB
traffic

292
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:05,540
is definitely not going to use that word
only circle to the poor

293
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:12,540
but the servers been allocated

294
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,500
make sure if you a consultant you don't
want to do those attacks

295
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,590
casual you just be like now go home

296
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,679
a matter fact we're proud press charges
because you got em be doing a lot of bad

297
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,410
stuff

298
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,950
so I just wanted you to be aware that
like you care

299
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,820
so the next three attacks enormous speak
about is my the land deal in happening

300
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,230
in

301
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,110
8.o 2.1 hewwo cancellation and

302
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,880
of course we all know that private
feelings remain tightly traffic on the

303
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,510
switch

304
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,190
and if they went from one switch to
another and power

305
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:53,950
they would have to pass to Roddy there
will be done on layer 3

306
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,309
so couple months ago and clear he
introduced me to this program 'cause

307
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:00,480
Gambian

308
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,830
15 I learned that program I was stuck in
my seek for three days now moving to

309
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,659
swim to learn all about these

310
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,850
program it's an incredible program on

311
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,720
you could do anything you want to block
you and when I say anything

312
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,140
anything you want to a big so

313
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,790
I'm about the same time I acquired a
client

314
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,260
and I'm I was going to be in a meeting I
came across this picture

315
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,660
in this bitch is sorta looks like what
my client had them

316
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,230
they have a pat down in lower Manhattan
near the main office was in Midtown

317
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,420
and satellite offices throughout the
United States

318
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,220
so the satellite offices would log into
this button

319
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,320
which would then transfer the
information

320
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,399
through the different feelings going to
the headquarters of with a midtown

321
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,730
and wanted a movie tomorrow though the
one with the games he and other

322
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,809
departments with now

323
00:21:56,809 --> 00:22:02,580
on within their company so I decided to
put with the parade here

324
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,000
and the traffic that I started receiving

325
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,640
use regular bars shark nothing crazy or
anything like that I started picking up

326
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
802 done

327
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,690
1q good thing and

328
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,380
in one shark if you click on that you
know to push in a bit

329
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,230
it shows you what vielen numbered that
information is running on

330
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,590
so of course because it's gonna be sent
so when the food

331
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,740
package in reading program studied
gathering more

332
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:34,870
information about HR in gathering
information about the team's the

333
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,320
in the security department and so on and
so forth I'll get back to this bit a

334
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,919
little bit later cuz I'm

335
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,280
some stuff that I wanna speak about
before sowing uses

336
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,000
other picture on when I did with this
%um please remember this picture

337
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,800
so the first thing is

338
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,140
on back at this which they had a row to
hear that I left out but

339
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:02,000
are back at this Ronnie level you should
make sure that you configure your

340
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,280
ingress filters for the landfill the
stuff that I'm doing

341
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,830
won't happen and with police command
that you could

342
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,449
that for your access-list on the router

343
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,460
them

344
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,540
now going on to the second portion of
this is the feeling how being so when

345
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,250
the crowd this information

346
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,870
of that which that I was living now on
studies is Gabi and

347
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,150
spoofed that switch and

348
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:33,980
with this is gonna be you can actually
going full the switch into

349
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,500
thinking it with itself or however you
want to do it

350
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,880
so going this WHOIS this

351
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,980
switch right here is that p3 beer

352
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,830
so once I was able to gather all the
information about these different feel

353
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,470
and think of course the VLAN ID he's a
changed a thing please return to go back

354
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,340
to the incline

355
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:03,060
a.m. but I think my

356
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,360
laptop on this put it on the switch in
went to Sonic

357
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,500
a crime information I saw beginning HR
information that I shouldn't have

358
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:15,120
on stuff about the DMZ there are certain
having definitely alarming

359
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,669
information on their marketing and
accounting mom

360
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,190
with the other viewings so I use Gabby
to

361
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,780
going foo and change the packet

362
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,020
the 8.o 2.1 QR gonna fly non out in the
second

363
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,260
but just to try to 'em the next piece I
want to talk about is how to prevent

364
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,640
vielen happening from happening arm of
course the border drinking

365
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,010
I don't know why people leave a little
drinking enabled the list the real easy

366
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,810
the next one is ports that are not being
used to shut them down

367
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:53,080
another thing hmm another one is
explicitly

368
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,560
configured reports on a switch if you
have ordered drunken enabled you can

369
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,139
stoli's which the information until port
the

370
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,890
isn't disabled the last but not least
don't use %um one

371
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,380
so this is the last piece to the

372
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,669
kinda all these three pieces that I was
speaking about

373
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:18,760
and to me this is the most important
piece because

374
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,129
funn cams Lee a packet you could easily
track

375
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:28,490
looks ominous switches and a half to a
lot of people here know about the linens

376
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,159
and things like that or just

377
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,220
for the first time of course the ninety
1 I'll keep you don't

378
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,770
you but I am in front to back it is

379
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,879
appealing ID number and that extends the
packing a little bit more I'll

380
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
to have that information is are there
the next thing is

381
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,330
are when it jumps from one switch to
another

382
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,330
those packets more have ito 2.1 cute and
getting that tackle also have the lawn

383
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,990
ID information and while sniffing out

384
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,300
on Wireshark I was able to acquire knows
how was able to

385
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,470
going to be the real and

386
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,550
this is the interesting part that I want
to show people

387
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:16,760
so this is me right here being the
attacker

388
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,290
and of course he's Gabby and when I did
with

389
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,770
I took this packet right here in in
scabby

390
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:28,900
I just created to double in consolation
bracket

391
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:33,010
so this them number seven right here

392
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,270
is one VLAN ID which is a bogus when the
edges used

393
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,668
and this is veal a number 27

394
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:44,140
so using scabby I took

395
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,310
this V this 8.o 2.1 cue tag which is the
first one enemy that 17

396
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:54,100
and this win twenty-seven so I think the
information to this which

397
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,140
this which automatically strips of you
know to

398
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,850
that 1q but because there's two of them
it's not too much trouble for the move

399
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,270
is only gonna ship one of

400
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,679
leaving the other one near and

401
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,830
I want is going attacked this one so

402
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:12,810
wanted stripped it of its still had the
tag at fifty two of two other switched

403
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:15,820
so and switch to assume that

404
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,860
which one put that one in there by then

405
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,100
just house job we can I was able to go
in targeted

406
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,790
that machine and do you know how to do
after that

407
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:32,658
film in order to insure this doesn't
happen of course

408
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:37,970
I'm I'd was just informed a couple days
ago that there's a new I left that stops

409
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,080
double incomes lesion packets

410
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,260
if anybody has information on there
please give the community wanted

411
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,730
tell them stuff out against them on the
next thing is don't use needed the UN's

412
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,760
I'm to ensure a signing onto ports

413
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,679
and last but not least force force all
packets take over the job or

414
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:03,400
to have at least the tag in like if it
is a I wish I believe

415
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,560
that stops the Dublin cancellation but
I'm not too sure in

416
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,550
wanna do more research on that one

417
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,668
and last but not least the p.m.

418
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:17,800
the movie MPs now

419
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,220
does anybody in your use the MPS at
their office

420
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,330
no okay that's a good thing

421
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:29,970
death can remove the the fetus is
supposed to be safe and everything but

422
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:33,470
this can really damage and network from
within

423
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,880
and the reason why is most important is
a lot as

424
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,940
information being passed to the switches
clear tax

425
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:43,650
so that is an encryption or anything
like that and it's clear tax

426
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,770
God knows the cabin after dinner and

427
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:50,658
also it so it's send over you TP so if
you had like some

428
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:54,179
TFTP clearly and the information

429
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:57,409
a new are someone new

430
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:01,360
come they would allow topping me get
access to go on to this feeling

431
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,980
the automatic the if they have the TPP
server on the switch

432
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,080
it send that information at the the the
MPS policy

433
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,300
and automatically puts that person and
so if I was in the country not just go

434
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,460
to office term

435
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,780
go right ahead and try to login if this
be MTP

436
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,678
if they don't have to set up correctly
you issue beyond me now be able to get

437
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,649
onto a feeling of course

438
00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:28,020
most company started setting up in
aggregate at

439
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,200
new people coming into the company or
anything have to go to certain things

440
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:31,899
but

441
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:35,570
as for the what I did to his client

442
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,600
they didn't and up because a lot in this
configuration

443
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,240
I was able to go in attacked with

444
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,399
on there's a mistake up here on this is
supposed to be PQP

445
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,750
but I am sorry one min it's okay thank
you

446
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:59,870
are catching of the Rings neither we
were brothers for real film

447
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,909
um the first thing is don't transmit

448
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,080
v QB information unless it's going to be
on a caravan with

449
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,178
and the second thing is if you are going
to implement the ambiance

450
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,300
then you probably have the resources and
capabilities to go unmonitored and stuff

451
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,500
them

452
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,700
that's pretty much the only thing 4 p.m.
PS

453
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,310
and at you don't have to use it no use
it all

454
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:34,260
an tough rapid web the final thing is do
you think a couple with

455
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,110
solutions in order to prevent all these
attacks from happening

456
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,870
and one of my most important and
favorite thing is this for years

457
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,110
select using a fan and he

458
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,649
as arm at work for communities you mean
like

459
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:52,830
and treat it like a root password

460
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,928
a lot of people who don't treat this
like that

461
00:30:55,929 --> 00:30:59,860
in so much information could be nice to
hear that can make

462
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,960
your network very very

463
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,120
open an exploitable so it's quite
important that you treat those

464
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,510
community strings like foo passwords

465
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,960
the I wanna go or from reading of
unintended like that my

466
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,550
these are pretty much all the many
easing

467
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:24,668
mitigating things to prevent these from
happening

468
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:29,530
disease open up for questions and will
not go to next Laden's

he said the dark yeah you have to be

496
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,850
able to go into the switch by there is

497
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,600
wave nothing firewalls ya been it's
gonna be

498
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,610
with gap you could begin any firewall
you want

499
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,390
anyone and it doesn't matter what it is
but the problem was you but I solar

500
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:43,390
yes

501
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:56,789
where do you live in yeah I am now very
well in the bed

502
00:33:56,789 --> 00:34:01,020
you bring up you bring up something now
that's why I bring this up I'll

503
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,429
okay I live in the Bronx and I have
Cablevision cablevision

504
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:09,929
does the same exact did everybody get to
hear what he said do you have any good

505
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:15,659
mine everybody know to question again so
I'm

506
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,419
Islands lower New York southeastern New
York so I have time warner cable

507
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:24,509
see ever wondered at if you have your
computer connected to Linksys router

508
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:28,869
order is exactly cable you see that but
people motive might

509
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:33,629
lighting up all the time not all that
arc traffic everyone looking for IP

510
00:34:33,629 --> 00:34:37,199
addresses are two routers and switches
think who got this IP address he got his

511
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,310
IP address maybe my neighbor in late May

512
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,549
because he had a party late getting
banged by know the use the Internet

513
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,149
there's my bed in the middle taxer going
on

514
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:50,980
okay um so once again I live in a bronx
in

515
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,020
what he brought up with a toward a valid
point so when I first got my cable into

516
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,009
the house I was like oh yes I got

517
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,359
remains down on this is awesome you know
and

518
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,420
all over them i three main things went
to 11.5 gram wondering why

519
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,160
you know band it's because everybody on
my block around the same time between

520
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,440
like six o'clock in nine o'clock in many

521
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,410
everybody let's jump on in so we only
have one pipeline

522
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:19,129
on the block that shootout everybody's
house individually and if

523
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,450
all the traffic keeps going up and down
a bit like that

524
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,580
we could pretty much assume what's going
to happen next

525
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:29,830
especially when I have annoying me boo
so they don't get access to internet

526
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,940
that went sometimes

527
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,260
yeah but it could totally totally habits
and we just decided let's get own

528
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,780
business line into the house and we'll
have about three make them fit onto

529
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,790
something

530
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:44,119
use our regular band will fall on the
you know

531
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,990
the good turns I yeah

532
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:54,990
any other questions yes arm

533
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,470
if I was in the tanker and I wanted to
go in

534
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,400
the UN's and didn't he have any
information

535
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,180
about any be lands that were on a
network which one do you think I'm gonna

536
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,089
try first

537
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:14,589
start of who won

538
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,430
good best way to start

539
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,190
n if you have the lands that like the
feeling when on

540
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,599
at work right and you don't have it
immediately to the

541
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,089
the switch itself if

542
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:32,430
you have it on that one according to the
UN when you know

543
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,129
and his delicate information on the
services for

544
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,380
I'm gonna be able to compromise the
right away the point i've

545
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,480
to me the point of putting these view
end

546
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,560
is to try to hide in actually the
traffic earnings and no one else can get

547
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,299
access to it

548
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,599
see what you read that velly ninety like
gold

549
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,599
um who goals coming down seles goodbye

550
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm you okay let that

551
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,880
but so

552
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,480
like I said if I went on today like to
climb

553
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,240
the first thing I do with him view in
1901 feeling one has to be a

554
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,690
unless they're really good more the
majority times you know a lot of people

555
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,710
wind up not using the landline

556
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:19,710
and also because siskel cynicism good

557
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,130
we got a Cisco shirt

558
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,830
or what

559
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,130
it 1q uses something called

560
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:35,420
native and Mon I unlike all the other

561
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,420
be lands the need to be live has no
today

562
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:45,150
sold if they're is it a ride to just
like in your example

563
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,170
where you had it to dare greater is it a
the second

564
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:52,220
just looks like they did to the first
swept and ignored by this week

565
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:55,460
but if there's no today then

566
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,690
the need to be lyn is normally used but
if you have spoofed

567
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,080
today and then sent it all onto the
native

568
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,430
the UN right so you sending it over a

569
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,850
over connection it's not supposed to
have attacked you

570
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,540
and it would have your home to the data
was supposed to go over the native

571
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,200
billion

572
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,470
but you're supposed to make was it to go
over the land of your choice instead

573
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,180
so that that's the way I love leaking
over to another

574
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:27,100
be and I'm also on with which with that
because the house which is prevent

575
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
things like that from happening

576
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,580
yeah and and the default %um used the
native %um is Bela number one

577
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,450
be your Cisco guy thing he's feeling
number one button

578
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:42,440
idea and then you know that's not a good
thing to do all

579
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,110
hmm all to

580
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,740
alright

581
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,900
any other questions you get new
questions work toward that goal to lift

582
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,750
do

583
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,230
yessir you could become lose you know
you enact a good guy

584
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:07,230
the gentleman you

585
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:41,220
your

586
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:53,400
now I have two questions for new num
first question is

587
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,339
let's switch to using second one is what
Catawissa using

588
00:39:57,339 --> 00:40:01,130
because that's the most important thing
that's why meet you are with these were

589
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,290
all the switches that

590
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,339
more businesses I still using

591
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:09,029
anything past 2001

592
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:15,339
key heard after presentation can you
just below through the fan

593
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:19,540
definitely when I get more information
about this anybody else

594
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:25,140
yes yes on a little bit

595
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,960
he's more the yet how that's gonna see
you then we didn't do it on

596
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,960
the attacks that we tried our on

597
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:53,890
yeah

598
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:05,140
meh year I did

599
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:17,170
okay

600
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:25,940
woody I was going to see what do you
mean the CBP for

601
00:41:32,729 --> 00:41:39,729
year

602
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:56,340
like

603
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,620
its

604
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,960
that's why we've relief a shut CDP or
fifth

605
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,370
you right

606
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,380
and that's why CDP souls

607
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:13,310
so Ste fuse my language was shitty
political

608
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:16,920
Nana

609
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,200
no I haven't

610
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,070
we need we've been tested on

611
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:30,150
yeah any other questions I wanted to add
something real quick

612
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,430
you know the slides early slides I
notice

613
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,220
down in the lab downstairs on the switch
to using

614
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,740
no 3651 I know you could have
