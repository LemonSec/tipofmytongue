okay

57
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,320
who everybody my name is smoke release

58
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
so I think are two years ago

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,680
I had a third-party conference

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,600
over in what is now the home

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,169
lose are describing some ideas I had at
that time

62
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,198
divoone involving an ID I call that the
time democracy

63
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,300
2.0 basically involves

64
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,580
a a thought experiment at the time

65
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,830
that to build a year

66
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,340
electronic voting infrastructure

67
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,770
that is secure a ball and open

68
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,320
from the get-go from the start and to
build it that way

69
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,030
and so far there's people coming closer
even today

70
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,460
bought still needs some work yet first
we'll start with an abridged history of

71
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,799
past election technologies in the best
diver city between them

72
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,039
as a whole the only way you can develop
a newer

73
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,289
more secure voting platform is to gain a
full understanding of the current and

74
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,430
past methods the problems associated
with them

75
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,849
there have been numerous and diverse
method used in the past

76
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:37,020
starting with paper-based electronic
voting systems are document ballot

77
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,870
voting systems

78
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,770
start out as a system where the votes
were cast and counted by hand

79
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,169
using physical paper ballots with the
advent of electronic tabulation this

80
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,960
involved into a system

81
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,560
and Mark paper cowards paper ballot
counted

82
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,490
electronically director about director
cord

83
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:58,560
electronic voting system record a

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,520
use using a ballot display to a
mechanical or electrical optical

85
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,400
component

86
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,330
that activated by the voter through but
we're touchscreen

87
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,680
this kinda system produces data using a
computer in records both

88
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,050
as digital images in its memory
post-election

89
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,039
it produces a tabulation above the
voting data that has been stored in its

90
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,180
removable memory

91
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,509
device as a printed copy this system
gain popularity in 2002

92
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:30,800
due to the Help America Vote Act mandate
that one handicap accessible voting

93
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,020
system be provided for polling place

94
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,789
most jurisdictions satisfied that with
the user with the re-

95
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:42,909
and some opted to switch over entirely
by 2004 30 percent registered US voters

96
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:47,029
you some kind of the area system a
public network

97
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,719
d areas at the area that transmits vote
data from individual polling places

98
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,880
to another location via public network

99
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,479
the Internet real good idea a vote

100
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:03,580
data can be transmitted both as each
ballots cast periodically islam's

101
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,099
love ballots through the election day or
as one complete batch

102
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:11,370
at the end the voting day we know how
well the security on the Internet is

103
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,750
here

104
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,080
in Switzerland however this is an
established part of local referendums

105
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,849
were voters

106
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:20,870
have passwords assigned to them to
access ballot access balance to the

107
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,880
postal service

108
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,120
and Estonia people cast their votes if
they choose to

109
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,130
I can use any voting system via the
Internet

110
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,210
voters a given specific days a convo
during an using a national ID card

111
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,620
equipped with a microchip are able to
get access to an online ballot

112
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,930
using a card reader and a government
assigned and number

113
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,630
optical scan voting systems work similar
to scantron systems were voters

114
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,800
dark in an oval and feed their ballet
into an optical reader which then

115
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,900
identifies which circle was filled in

116
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,400
and as it to that candidates total on

117
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,400
outbreak for me speech here for a moment
mention I

118
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,130
did here the talk yesterday on hacking
democracy and how easy it is to defeat

119
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,770
that

120
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,310
a now we go about with the server

121
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,539
now that we know some other different
systems that are available

122
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,279
in US and Europe we can discuss some
other companies that provide them

123
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:23,279
for our use

124
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,290
Diebold election system has had some
scandals in the past related to their

voting indirect irregularities in 2006
Diebold made the decision to remove

their name from the front

at critical flaws that could undermine
the integrity of the 2008

immediately this commission the

Commission

189
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,740
until further testing is done and there
are advantages and disadvantages to all

190
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,860
these rolling machines

191
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:31,860
and morning feat in and of themselves
are no exception MIT's

Charles two-word estimates that up to
one million more ballots were counted in

193
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,370
2004

194
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:41,930
as opposed to in 2000 because electronic
voting machines detected votes that

195
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,810
paper-based ballot paper base machine
missed disadvantages

196
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:50,819
I is being argued that theoretically
humans are not equipped

197
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,719
to verify operations occurring with an
electronic machine

198
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,260
and because of that the operations
cannot be trusted

199
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,569
that is furthered by computing experts
arguing that trooper

200
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,959
true programmers cannot trust any
program they did not

201
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,620
are for themselves under a secret ballot
system

202
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:13,620
there is no known import nor any
expected output to compare election

203
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,230
victory a result

204
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:20,010
those accuracy honesty and security up
the entire electronic system

205
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:23,920
cannot be verified by humans that this
day

206
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,089
because not everything is perfect and we
all know technology is not infallible

207
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:31,670
there have been certain groups formed
and legislation passed

208
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:36,020
to help make life a bit more fair

209
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,060
electronic voting system store ballots
in digital form in memory this

210
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,190
method is used exclusively by Dr E
systems

211
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,520
when electronic ballots are used there
is no need to print paper ballots and no

212
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,689
risk running out of ballots thereby
significantly reducing both cost and

213
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,230
waste

214
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,110
this also allows balance to be offered
in multiple languages using a single

215
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,880
machine

216
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,760
which is required by the National Voting
Rights Act of 1965

217
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,589
King County washington's demographics
require them under US federal election

218
00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,470
law to provide ballot access

219
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,579
in Chinese which means they need to
decide how many Chinese language balance

220
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:14,319
they need

221
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,589
and how made to put each polling place
thereby wasting a significant amount

222
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,260
paper

223
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,730
the National Voting Rights Act of 1965
also call the Voting Rights Act

224
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,870
outlaws the requirement that would be
voters must pass

225
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,449
literacy test before they can register
to vote and provides for federal reg

226
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:36,199
duration: voters in areas were less than
50 percent

227
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,360
love eligible minority voters registered
this Act implies that it establishes an

228
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,120
explicit right to vote for US citizens
however

229
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,260
there is no such federal right for
example ex-felons Campo

230
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,439
instead it grants a fundamental right

231
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,660
the Help America Vote Act or column

232
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,540
has three goals replaced punch card
voting systems with computerized ones

233
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,849
create the election assistance
Commission to assist

234
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,449
in the administration federal elections
and

235
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:11,449
establish a minimum election
administration standards

236
00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:15,250
however mandates that all the states and
localities upgrade the aspects

237
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:19,770
other election procedures including
voting machines registration processes

238
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:24,089
and poll worker training specific 7
fermentation have been left up to each

239
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,040
state

240
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,400
so there's going to be varying
interpretations a federal law

241
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,689
the Americans with Disability Act
demands handicapped access be provided

242
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:34,930
in at least one

243
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:38,209
voting booth in every voting precinct

244
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:42,640
one study done shows that the voting
rate among people with disabilities is

245
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,100
20 percent

246
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,480
points Western sable people because

247
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,730
more than 20,000 polling places across
the nation are inaccessible

248
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,020
thereby depriving disable people love
their fundamental right to vote

249
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,400
now what's trying to take a look at more
in-depth look at the newest learning

250
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,310
technologies available today

251
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,310
and coming in the near future

252
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,150
Prime three was developed by the
human-centered computing lab at Auburn

253
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,670
University in 2005

254
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,949
it offers a secure open source
multimodal

255
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:21,439
electronic voting system which is able
to deliver the necessary system security

256
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,990
integrity and user satisfaction
safeguards

257
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,510
to it for your inner user-friendly
interface

258
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,270
that accommodates all people regardless
the technical ability

259
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,730
implements what they call the universal
design meaning

260
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,780
the product is designed to be used in
all environments

261
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,199
by as many people as possible regardless
the age ability

262
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,730
or situation it is designed to be
barrier-free

263
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,740
so it can be used by the electorate the
blind

264
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,150
the death and the physically disabled

265
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,310
punched and is touted as the first vote
capturing system

266
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,880
to offer full with and and verifiability
up the election results

267
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:07,329
beyond ordinary paper audit trails the
entire punched an election process said

268
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,418
to be so easy

269
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:12,209
it can be summarized on a single
printable she dove eight by five island

270
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,850
paper

271
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,550
into and the cryptographic independent
verification

272
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,438
is in a mechanism built into an election
that allows voters to take a piece at

273
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,220
the ballot home

274
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:27,800
with them as a receipt it doesn't allow
voters to prove to others how they voted

275
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,030
but only that they have properly
indicated their votes to election

276
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,879
officials

277
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,520
and to verify with extremely high
assurance that all votes were counted

278
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,540
properly

279
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,810
scant a gritty is an integrity issue

280
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,908
earns add-on for any conventional
optical scan voting system

281
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:49,450
it gives voters the ability to verify
that their votes were recorded and

282
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,669
tallied correctly

283
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:55,929
without altering the basic form love the
ballot or how the voter uses it

284
00:17:55,929 --> 00:17:59,870
it provides a low footprint audit
companion solution

285
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,040
to for any current optical scan voting
system using special

290
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:21,139
okay it to come up

00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:25,850
upstart as you will see by the graphic
in the corner

292
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,870
more and more people are concerned if
their vote accounting or if it's a

293
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,220
crapshoot

294
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,649
some places are putting their concern
aside and experimenting with distance

295
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:39,919
balloting that's a graphic that way

recent years but none of them prove
beyond the experimental phase

308
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:30,639
be intense is to have a new distance

voters in the UK

319
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:08,050
Germany and Japan this kiosk will be
open for 10 days prior to the November

320
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,980
4th election

321
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,950
and will be administered by county
election officials using a proven

322
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,280
transparent

323
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,760
and secure electronic promoting voting
technology over a secure VPN connection

324
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,070
the votes will then be delivered to a
secure County server for official tally

325
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,470
this means no paper no mail no hassle no
waiting

326
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,179
and voters will get a receipt saying
your ballot has been cast to prove their

327
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:33,990
ballot was counted

328
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,130
this is our first real concrete mention
true verification via

329
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:45,130
got recruit octopi in this case using a
VPN

330
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,270
systems that allow voters to verify
their vote is recorded and then

331
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,450
tabulated with an appropriate
mathematical calculation

332
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,950
can alleviate concerns that their vote
has not been correctly

333
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,000
cord and electronic receipt

334
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,179
signed by the bowling authority using a
digital signature

335
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:06,280
can conclusively prove the accuracy of
the tally but cannot guarantee the

336
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,418
animated

337
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,190
above the voters choice which can be an
enabler for voter intimidation

338
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:19,040
or about selling there are solutions
that came to let the voter verify their

339
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,820
that aim to let the voter verify their
vote personal life by a third party

340
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,840
wouldn't had that ability this would be
done by tagging each vote with a

341
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,300
randomly generated session ID that would
allow the voter to check that their

342
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,610
specific vote

343
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,230
or that session ID specific session ID

344
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,230
was recorded correctly through a public
ballot audit trail

345
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,899
machines that are able to provide
immediate feedback for voters

346
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:47,440
can 8 in the detection of 100 voting or
over voting

347
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,190
which could result in an errant ballot
total

348
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,010
in order to protect against hidden
agendas many groups have called for

349
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,720
transparency

350
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,380
and with good reason

351
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,179
the open rights group purpose is to
preserve digital rage in their freedoms

352
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:05,409
by making people aware

353
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,679
digital rights issues they also put
journalists in contact with experts

354
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,530
thereby fostering grassroots activists

355
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,668
their biggest campaigns involve digital
rights management

356
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:20,919
the extension of copyright protection to
sound recordings and e-voting security

357
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:25,240
the organization was formed based on a
panel discussion held at openText 2005

358
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,090
after several people illustrated

359
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,300
that there was a serious interest
interest towards change

360
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:35,340
they are the major forefront in pushing
for transparency covering practices as

361
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,899
well as transit privacy

362
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:41,389
and human dignity through the opposition
a automatic vehicle tracking

363
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:45,590
communication data retention and RFID
chip thing

364
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,330
a complete audit trail should be
available in addition to transparency

365
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,550
to help prevent potential problems that
would otherwise have gone

366
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,129
unnoticed

367
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:00,470
voter verified paper audit trail also
called verified papery

368
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,690
record or VV patch is designed as an
independent verification system for

369
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,060
voting machines designed to permit
voters

370
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,260
to check if their vote was cast
correctly which would

371
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,750
8 in the detection %uh election fraud or
machine malfunction

372
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,590
however this has some problems videos
taken documenting voter behavior during

373
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,550
an actual election election

374
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,260
show that most voters do not verify
their choices ages

375
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,190
take their besito them away a manual
recount

376
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:34,669
or order using a BB Pat system is labor
intensive and extremely costly

377
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:38,560
it is likely to be unaffordable to most
candidates

378
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,090
the recreate your other is doctor

are described in her PhD dissertation as

380
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,750
the proposed answer to the affordability
question

381
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,260
to having the voting machine printer

aisle

383
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,350
that can be visibly verified by the
voter before being entered

384
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,740
into a secure location this has been
commonly referred to as the mercury

method

386
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:05,940
and to an audible voting systems

387
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,610
provide independent verification through
the storage the job Alex

388
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,389
using cryptographic methods this
provider's

389
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:17,620
this provides voters with the receipt to
allow them to verify

390
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,770
that their vote is included in the tally
in that all the votes

391
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:24,929
cast were done so by Valley registered
voters the receipt would not permit a

392
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,070
voter to prove to others who they voted
for

393
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:34,570
the to quote you see are from a draft
written by researchers for the end I S T

394
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:39,120
the first is from the actual draft and
the second is an explanation that was

395
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,850
required after some people claim that
could be misinterpreted

396
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,830
auditing could also be a stepping stone
to show if any vote tampering had taken

397
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,500
place

398
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,210
the image you see there is courtesy of

these keys made based on his picture and

401
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,560
two others found online to give greater
detail

402
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,860
also a rumor to work with hotel minibar

in adequately secured hard-working be
subject to physical tampering

404
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,070
which includes insertion for and
hardware this could allow for

405
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,649
man in the middle style attacks which
means that even sealing machines might

406
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,240
not be sufficient protection

407
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,010
I'm sure the other talk demonstrated a
quite explicitly

408
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,280
are some groups counter claim that with
proper review in testing procedures they

409
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,070
can detect fraudulent code or foreign
hardware

410
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,530
they further go on to say that with the
inclusion a proper chain of custody

411
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:44,000
it with the radically eliminate the
possibility %uh

412
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,750
hardware/software insertion I love
anybody who reads I have felt blog at

413
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,760
freedom to tinker

414
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,510
dot com yeah he posted the how many
pictures %uh voting machines in the

415
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:56,350
Trenton area

416
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:01,910
some security experts have demanded that
voting machine source code should be

417
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,980
made publicly available for inspection

418
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:09,100
others suggest publishing voting machine
software under a free software license

419
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,690
like it is done in Australia

420
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,860
in order to provide for their early
prevents

421
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,930
any and against all the problems that
we've discussed

422
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:23,930
there are methods a certification and
testing which machines can go through

423
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,870
parallel testing involves randomly
selecting voting machines on election

424
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,350
day

425
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:35,309
and ensuring that the yield the same
result when given the same input

426
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:40,559
in the US there is no mandatory federal
certification for voting machines

427
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,480
they leave each state up to policing
their own voting machines for valor de

428
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,600
the US election assistance Commission
has assumed a federal responsibility for

429
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,350
accrediting

430
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,770
voting system testing labs and
certifying

431
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:57,480
voting equipment through the voting
system verification and laboratory

432
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,120
accreditation program their goal

433
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,480
is to independently verify that voting
systems comply with the functional

434
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,260
capabilities accessibility

435
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,820
and security requirements necessary to
ensure that the integrity and the

436
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,500
reliability of the voting system

437
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:16,710
operation as described by the voluntary
voting system guidelines

438
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,340
to ensure that not every lap can apply
for accreditation

439
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:25,270
the and then I S T recommends last for
accreditations to the National

440
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:30,160
voluntary laboratory accreditation
program the ACM

441
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,630
published a document I'll smoke vote
small boat

442
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:36,960
manipulations can swing elections the
URL thanks

443
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,429
yeah the URL's which uses mathematical
reasoning to determine

444
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:45,490
that the 2000 US presidential election
could have ended differently about me to

445
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,260
vote in

446
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,309
each precinct were changed they
determined that that ninety percent of

447
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:54,570
the total votes were cast the e-voting
machines while the remaining

448
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:57,678
10 percent were cast in some paper-based
method

449
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,010
and therefore would not count towards
the toe love you voting machines require

450
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,679
each machine contains a toll a number I
ballots for any candidate

451
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,940
a designated by M that will be changed

452
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,100
to vote for candidate be one machine is
required for

453
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:20,490
a certain number a voz denoted by the
for this they use 200 which assumes two

454
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,490
hundred voters per every machine

455
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,820
which gives each voter 4.2 minutes on
average

456
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,149
to cast their ballot the number of
voting machines require per precinct

457
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,850
would be ninety percent

458
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,610
times the number of votes cast force
last three

459
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,909
according to the records there were
284,000 394

460
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:46,409
voting precinct in the 2000 election
which works out to an average a 572

461
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:51,960
vote casper precinct if a malicious
person is only be able to change clothes

462
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,890
on a per precinct bases they will only
have to change to

463
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,460
votes per precinct in the state of
Florida New Mexico

464
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,540
and Iowa in order to sway the eight
outcome

465
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,389
the entire election the verified voting
foundation

466
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,159
advocates the use voter verified paper
trails

467
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:14,740
our paper ballots for all elections in
the US so that voters

468
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,260
can inspect individual permanent records
up their ballots before they are cast

469
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,320
and so that meaningful recounts baby
conducted the

470
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,480
open voting consortium was born up the
problem a broken

471
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,059
voting which began during the 2000
election debacle

472
00:29:32,059 --> 00:29:35,340
it was started by Jim Welch a voter who

473
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,990
made his selections on a touch-screen
voting machine only to notice that his

474
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,580
vote for mister see change before
resigns

475
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:46,040
when he alerted the election judge to
this he was given the option to complete

476
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,080
his current ballot

477
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,158
or voided and try a new ballot on the
same defective machine

478
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:55,870
this degraded his confidence in the
current electronic voting architecture

479
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,809
which led him to band together with
others

480
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,000
and support open voting which drives for
two things

481
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,130
one the entire voting system must be
open to public scrutiny

482
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,809
no trade secrets a leopard and a paper
ballot

483
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,340
receipt I can be handled stacked counted
and recounted

484
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,200
if necessary they currently have a beta
version

485
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,830
%uh open source voting software-based of
Ubuntu Linux called Ovi see

486
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:23,928
and I can be found at the URL that's up
there

487
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,840
runs on a stripped down version
customized Ubuntu

488
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,600
and actually a very interesting software
I

489
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,040
there's a possible solution that would
be ensure security

490
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,280
the electronic voting platform and
there's other research

491
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,770
being conducted by the trust Inc Trusted
Computing Group

492
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:48,770
related to platform security now before
I go into this part

493
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,790
talk I was here for Richard Stallman
stalk at the last Pope

494
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:57,480
are and at 260 are regarding TPM and how

495
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,590
evil it can turn out to be but if you
think about this would be one

496
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,190
application where trusted computing chip

497
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,450
just may come in handy for verifying any
type %uh cryptography

498
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,190
involved in that process %uh the Trusted
Computing Group primary goals to help

499
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:16,000
you to protect their information on
assets like data

500
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,850
password he's ex-senator from
compromised due to foreign code

501
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:20,669
execution

502
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:26,090
or physical theft the organization was
defined in such a way to enable broad

503
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,340
participation

504
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,059
efficient management and widespread
adoption of their specifications most

505
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,678
notably the Trusted Computing

506
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,510
trusted Platform Module and the trusted
network connect

507
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,230
specifications we believe that a
combination of these two specifications

508
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,460
together

509
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,380
could be the beginning of a solution for
in secure electronic voting

510
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,530
for the sake of time constraints will
only be covering just the TPM

511
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:55,389
as it relates hardware and software
security

512
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,440
the TPM is a microcontroller that's the
worst he's passwords and digital

513
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,669
certificates

514
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:04,040
it is affixed to the motherboard in a
way that it functions below the bias

515
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,720
level

516
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,970
to ensure secure boot environment for
system which could be used to prevent

517
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,780
foreign or untrusted code execution

518
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,090
on and electronic voting black access to
the platform could be denied

519
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:21,470
if the boot sequence was not as expected
if foreign hardware that was not present

520
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,010
at last food

521
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,250
is detected at current boo or foreign
code is executed

522
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:33,080
that causes the cash value have any file
on the boot checklist to change

523
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:36,820
systems with TPM chips offer
hardware-based security for numerous

524
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,879
applications including files in folder
encryptions

525
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,929
password management VPN and PK I

526
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:47,380
authentication as well as wireless
authentication for 80 21 X

527
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,799
specifications this would help insurer
voting machines that report their

528
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:52,470
results via

529
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,899
up VPN or in a group to channel over a
public network

530
00:32:55,899 --> 00:33:00,090
would remain secure in the event
attacker were able to make an attempt to

531
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,299
sniff the network traffic

532
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:06,889
CPM's are provided in various discrete
and integrated forms

533
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,409
through Atmel Broadcom if any on sign of
sin

534

and with Novo openly admitted to
carrying models

539
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,010
which have TPM built onto the
motherboard that by default

540
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,980
even if susan Mike non functional laptop
over there has to be

541
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,540
chip as part of the specification

542
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:41,240
they have designed 30 p.m. so that
vendors can change pad

543
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,230
can package it or provide input/output
method suitable for inclusion in systems

544
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,360
other than PCs possibly into electronic
billing platforms

545
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,809
let's take a bit closer look at the
actual

546
00:33:53,809 --> 00:33:57,820
algorithmic specifications

547
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,620
as a metric key functions for on-chip
keep your generation use a hardware

548
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,470
random number generator

549
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,470
private key signatures and public-key
encryption

550
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,070
this provides private key detection
which enables more secure storage for

551
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:10,820
files

552
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,280
and digital secrets there is hard work
pays protection for the symmetric keys

553
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,800
associated with software encrypt files
and for the private file private keys

554
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,629
use for digital signatures the random
number generators used to create he's

555
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:28,049
and perform operations on private keys

556
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:31,790
which are protected by the key p.m. even
when in use

557
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,800
secure storage of hash values to a
series a platform control registers were

558
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,369
PCR ce

559
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,730
allows them to use a as secure reporting

560
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,800
up certain variables ashes created dir:
to inventory the system hardware

561
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,419
and through a list of files checked at
Buddh are stored using PC

562
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:53,368
PC arms now that we know what out with
Mr

563
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:56,480
our algorithms that uses and with
capable of working with

564
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,100
you're probably wondering what operating
systems it's compatible with

565
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,690
several members at the TGC have design
limits face of course tax to extend

566
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,109
compatibility among

567
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:13,880
a varity operating systems there are
specifications for trust the servers

568
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,690
trusted mobile devices trusted storage

569
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:21,109
and therefore a trusted infrastructure
that are being worked towards

570
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,910
finalization

571
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:27,549
even now as we speak the TGC design does
not have any requirement that software

572
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,880
be certified

573
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,460
by any organization for example how
Microsoft uses

574
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,740
verified drivers the idea is that it can
be so flexible

575
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:41,270
it can be used on a Varian platforms and
through a varity

576
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,040
software to secure secure record data

577
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,569
and to securely store ensign digital
keys

578
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:52,490
there are some compliments that can be
used in addition to the key p.m.

579
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,839
for security purposes

580
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,259
smart cards and biometrics are
considered fixed token

581
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,950
their use to enhance user authentication
data

582
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,410
communications and/or platform security

583
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:12,740
Microsoft BitLocker Drive Encryption is
designed specifically to make use of the

584
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,050
key p.m.

585
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,069
the PC client specifications developed
by the T juicy

586
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:21,920
are used to protect critical system
files and user data

587
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,980
to help insure that a computer running
Windows Vista has not been tampered

588
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:29,680
with while offline for this to work
properly

589
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,520
the key p.m. must be other specification
12

590
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,530
and the system's buyers must meet UGC
requirements

591
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:41,210
it is possible to use BitLocker without
a key p.m. if you store the keys on a

592
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,839
USB flash drive

593
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:46,339
however this is not preferred
configuration or was it design

594
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:49,460
to be the typical usage the TPM

595
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,470
is designed to be secure sOooo through a
series of authentications

596
00:36:53,470 --> 00:37:00,400
done at the lower levels of the boot
process

597
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,589
TPM authentication secure read
everything that's there

598
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,910
arm one thing I won't mention here as
well as I've been looking at a program

599
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,210
called

600
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:12,540
trusted rub which was being worked on
right now

601
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,009
by a university injured in Germany move

602

name is escaping me at the moment arm

603
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:24,880
you can ask me about the talk to him
laptop that tournament on their

604
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,080
the end result evolve this

605
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,730
if you were properly implemented would
be phased in a corruption-free political

606
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,170
process that could be restored

607
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,210
once this properly implemented and voter
interest according to be greatly

608
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:40,319
increase because then you know your vote
will actually

for schools

628
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,650
in San images time to get your fight
about more

629
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,980
about certain topics and issues

630
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:36,530
it was a and about in a scientific
America

631
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,850
they're talking about fortifying on
their podcast and it was shown

632
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,299
it was shown about 48 percent in a test

633
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,320
and 2 percent 24 percent an actual

634
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,640
point places voter prime

635
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,799
only images like if your church in my

636
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,510
more on pro-life issues you know moral
issue

637
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,470
worries that with more it's not as
though it's not a left-right but its

638
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,030
with right that's not electronic however
when you're describing there is is is a

639
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,180
pattern of how

640
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,009
voters are going to vote at a polling
place depending on their background for

641
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,570
example

642
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,020
that's entirely allowable Amin it is
what it is yeah

643
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,290
saying my up

644
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:25,980
I love voter in you got a point there in
a way as far as voter intimidation goes

645
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,050
or coercion

646
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,230
I love that would that would not be

647
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:35,360
something that would work as it as so
the current technology is right now if

648
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,700
you go into a voting booth

649
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,340
okay you're still going to vote your
conscience regards to what

650
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,180
your conditioned to believe or whatever
otherwise because once a curtain closes

651
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,290
that's the whole that's the whole idea
behind a secret ballot to begin with

652
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:55,290
saying that yet

653
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,460
where that that's all those people who
are saying the way they voted after they

654
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:04,760
leave

655
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,700
booth once they're in that booth they're
gonna vote whatever way they want

656
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:12,310
and the value of the secret voters to
preserve because they can say anything

657
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,630
they want let's take a nap

658
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:19,720
you follow I mean I mean once you're in
that

659
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,810
once you're in that booth you're gonna
vote the way you want regardless of what

660
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,490
you tell anybody when you get outside

661
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:28,190
hmm

662
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:33,740
it was something he burned about

663
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,080
yet but there's going to be a high error
rate depending on how many people tell

664
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,569
the truth

665
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:44,570
yet

666
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,640
mmm

667
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,630
right a churches are very popular for
voting place they stood on one myself

668
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,130
once

669
00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,980
bought at no time did I feel that my
vote was coerced one way or another just

670
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,410
because it was in the house I got

671
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:10,410
yep mmm

672
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,960
mmm

673
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,869
I i have to read up on that IIIi did not
hear anything I love that

674
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:27,450
send me link you got my name

675
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,869
yes uses

676
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:36,469
his are some of the systems are actually
already in place a for example the

677
00:42:36,469 --> 00:42:41,170
open voting consortiums arm a VC disc I
was actually being

678
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,469
arm pushed out right now for the state
of California

679
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:48,299
and in fact he reinstated New York up in
upstate New York somewhere

680
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,099
%ah there exploring the possibility of
using live CDs

681
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:55,799
for a a replacement electronic voting
system

682
00:42:55,799 --> 00:43:01,869
%uh

683
00:43:01,869 --> 00:43:05,529
I'm sure gonna be a lot more eyes on a
than they were in 2004 so that in

684
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:07,170
another itself is going to be a good
thing

685
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,289
on the only thing you can say as far as
being in having a secure election is

686
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,269
they will get security time goes on

687
00:43:13,269 --> 00:43:17,569
as newer technology come out being
developed and that those technologies

688
00:43:17,569 --> 00:43:18,288
are applied

689
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:23,099
it's not gonna happen overnight but with
time

690
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:27,940
you know the system so get better %uh
unfortunately I am sure the attack

691
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,599
will get better as well the attack
vectors in the threat models and such

692
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,690
boy its a never ending game just like
anything else I as far as I information

693
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:38,420
security

694
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,999
you can only secured for so long to
somebody hacked and it's up to the next

695
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:43,400
level

696
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,250
I'm I'm I'm

697
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,480

00:45:03,089 --> 00:45:06,900
you on worried about what %um

720
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,089
you know halls muncie

721
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:13,150
I provide was with me

722
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,530
website in use on is good

723
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,559
Graham room

724
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,670
she mom all uses

725
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,270
home I the with my

726
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,690
boss book fancy

727
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,250
with North we must be home

728

I'm alright guys Z mine over

729
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:41,170
on someone problem

730
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:44,319
them out for us %um tune all

731
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,359
we were were because lime

732
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,420
yep that and that's a good point that's
where chain of custody system would come

733
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,180
in handy

734
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:57,480
where anyone who handles that device
and/or leaves it alone

735
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,069
or put it wherever and whatever room for
whatever reason

736
00:46:01,069 --> 00:46:05,390
a change because she would keep a record
I'll those interactions with the machine

737
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:06,078
itself

738
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,339
from the moment it leaves a storage
facility how it struck

739
00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:12,470
how it's handled where it's left how
long was it

740
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,869
open was a lot are on their policies

741
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:18,869
RVs on have the

742
00:46:18,869 --> 00:46:22,059
palm for me I'm somewhere

743
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:26,490
you'd users him

744
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:29,490
your fewer in

745
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,400
the problem I in addition to trusting
the developers of the original system

746
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,930
arm if you go to the open voting
consortium dock on for example you can

747
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:38,609
download

748
00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:42,950
%uh the demo CD and all the source code
used with it are you can examine from

749
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,720
that point I had actually spoken with

750
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,420
Island Eckerd are who is the primary
proponent

751
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:54,010
love the open voting consortium I have
spoken with him at great length last

752
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:54,520
night

753
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,849
and he does it does say that even though
these

754
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:01,160
that downloadable software there now of
is

755
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,359
in beta %ah it is being worked on as far
as a hardware security

756
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:10,730
and our chain to custody issues are are
being addressed right now and I would

757
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:11,970
imagine he would have

758
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,010
more news forthcoming he's presenting
this

759
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,839
up various he's reached are presenting
his software in the near future I think

760
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,808
in August 27th I think

761
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:25,160
in San Francisco I could be running the
place to buff

762
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,490
if you go to open a voting consortium
that work I he would have all the

763
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:29,430
details there

764
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:36,430
Herms

765
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:41,970
option sons

766
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:46,170
were on there's Liam

767

loss Rome so

769
00:47:55,810 --> 00:48:00,210

ones

774
00:48:13,549 --> 00:48:17,099
your you for moms

775
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:21,440

full

777
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,150
%um for

778
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,110
on

779
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,890
yes

780
00:48:30,890 --> 00:48:37,000
yes them home

781
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,280
you know knows

782
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,150
you

783
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,510
it doesn't bomb by itself of course %uh
paper

784
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,440
by votes for example up by themselves
have been subject to tampering itself

785
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,330
over the years

786
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,520
boy it still serves as a backup
mechanism

787
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,759
%uh for disaster recovery if something
honestly should happen with the machine

788
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:06,610
then you can use ever if I dot paper
trail to reconstruct the actual vote

789
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:10,320
so by itself is not the answer but in
combination with

790
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,200
electronic voting machines it can serve
as a part of the answer

791
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,670
mention said

792
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,799
you

793
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:29,050
would mom

794
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:32,600
yes

795
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,950
on

796
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,430
I actually don't have that data handy
but

797
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:43,419
it I'm sorry they were better able to be
counted

798
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,470
apparently your

799
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:51,260
mmm right there was a specified at the
time

800
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,870
United

801
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:58,598
works

802
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:02,650
was that I M

803
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:04,410
problem

804
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:09,058
from soon

805
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:15,930
or was no

806
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,450
in said

807
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,990
me

808
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,230
on that blaze would be a better a

809
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,590
Ridge they responded to that question I
did not

810
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:31,750
I was not involved in that operation or
in any of those operations myself but

811
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,170
I would tend to trust most most if not
all of the

812
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:43,170
recommendations that they had made at
that time

813
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:50,079
mom

814
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:57,079
is so

815
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:01,769
yes

816
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:03,790
once

817
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,000
stuff

818
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,069
C

819
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:14,029
a uniform set of security standards
would be a good start

820
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:18,690
are both for the software and the
hardware are the entire design should be

821
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:19,559
inspected

822
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,230
are as well as tested in a real-life
situation

823
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:29,150
but unfortunately at the moment there is
no

824
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,270
up said guidelines for that about the

825
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:40,270
Help America Vote Act is only certifying
certain testing laboratories for that

826
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:46,600
anybody else

827
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:53,600
I see a hand back there okay go ahead

828
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,980
groom

829
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,310
go ahead

830
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:12,310
at a Momo over thank you

831
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,970
good

832
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,650
at the moment no no mention was made of
that but it's an interesting thought did

833
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,500
and in fact if something is that could
be somehow

834
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,470
married to a hardware verified a
cryptographic chip like 30 p.m. or

835
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,070
something better that comes out

836
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:45,070
a I'd be all for it to you

837
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:51,180
emails

838
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:57,710
so got a few minutes left

839
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:01,509
okay then I guess is it if you have any
questions feel free to ask me after the

840
00:53:01,509 --> 00:53:01,809
guy

841
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:04,809
after the talk here I'll be floating
around here there

842
00:53:04,809 --> 00:53:11,809
and I thank you for let me speak

843
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:20,210
ok

844
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:27,460
just wrong

845
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,750
with word

846
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:31,410
a ride
