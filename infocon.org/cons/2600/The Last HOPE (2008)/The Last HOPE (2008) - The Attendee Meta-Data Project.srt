1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,480
as a quick said this is meant to
introduce the attendee manager

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,880
system appear on the stager some the
people

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,099
involved in the project we actually had
about over 20 people

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,190
at different times involved in getting
it running up

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,210
which it will be soon %uh this is

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:23,080
Matt he's been now one of our co
infrastructure leads infrastructures

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,280
some running the cables everywhere and
%ah

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,960
the readers for the RFID system on
milosz

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,920
is from the CCC and he has some open be
condoned org

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,129
and he developed to the RFID system that
we're using

11
00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:39,559
on so he's very smart on

12
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:44,050
and %uh then on the end is I want
workers New Amsterdam

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,719
and %uh christina is coming back in a
minute

14
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,589
with a laptop so we can show you the
website on

15
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:54,800
at sea

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,989
%uh the basics is that we're using

17
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,479
on an online survey and matching

18
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:05,829
the survey data with position tracking
RFID and

19
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:08,939
we're combining did in the same database
to

20
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,009
figure out what people are interested in
what they're doing

21
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:16,939
at the conference for about half the
people here we have %uh 1400 those

22
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:17,329
little

23
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:20,619
RFID badges fooling around and I'll

24
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:25,210
we were kinda expecting somewhere south
3000 people to show for the conference

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,689
so

26
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:29,520
roughly half the people showing up
should be able to get one on

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,908
so I'll start of on though why part

28
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,810
love ok why this song was started

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,020
about a year and a half ago Tom

30
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,490
I was on Nov this new form that they put
up on

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,740
hooked on that which is %uh talk to hope
tuttle form board where people are

32
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,750
talking about hope

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,000
and %ah they put the section up that
said new projects for the next top

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,600
and %uh I'd been to which 2k2

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,999
and the fifth hope and hope number six
and it occurred to me that we getting

36
00:02:00,999 --> 00:02:01,789
these big

37
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,280
seminar rooms and we have all these
people and one person is standing up

38
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,070
you're talking

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,580
and they're all these people in the
audience were interested in

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,840
the thing they're there to hear about so

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,800
getting them to connect to each other
was kinda

42
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,450
up something I was interested in and Dom
on

43
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,750
January 17th 2007 I posted

44
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,209
this message title attend the many data

45
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,409
I'm not a programmer which causes me
know in the frustration with the number

46
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,120
a project that's been on my head

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,260
but I have this idea for getting people
with similar interests to meet during

48
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,340
the conference

49
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,890
the basic idea is that we have a web
form that collects information about

50
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,720
your interests

51
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,650
and uses that information to help you
find like-minded

52
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,420
like-minded hope goers %ah I

53
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,900
done talking about not how hospitals
were using this a similar systems to get

54
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,140
patient information

55
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:59,739
on state having you sit there with the
clipboard they're using but terminals

56
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:01,620
together that sort information

57
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,610
Tom to get the doctors more information
in advance

58
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,700
and in this case were helping each other
get more information

59
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,129
about each other's interests in advance
on

60
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:17,579
and %ah disc I also said that this could
compare to the myers-briggs

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,000
questionnaires on that can help you
figure what your career path is

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,579
on for might be so

63
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:29,480
what I said was that I prefer science I
propose that we set aside an hour during

64
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,590
the conference

65
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,060
where a buncha tables would be set up
with shot

66
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,200
different symbols and Donna and each one
there'd be a big bottle mountain doing a

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,239
buncha pretzels

68
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,970
and we have people %uh go through the
website

69
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,730
and figure out on what their interests
were and the computer would spit back at

70
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,560
some point

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,480
a simple that they would used to find
other people with an interest

72
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,000
at the conference and a so after I
posted that

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,049
message Tom suddenly

74
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:04,019
people were suggesting physical tags
that people would

75
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,860
actually where so they could connect to
each other without going to the tables

76
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,750
sorta thing with and a venam thurman
suggested that we start using smart

77
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,659
cards RFID

78
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,779
and %ah then people were kind of

79
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,549
bar spending around a manual came in on
the foreman said

80
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,049
this is an idea we've been talking about
for a while and would love to do it

81
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,410
and I it went in circles for about six
pages

82
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,639
and died %uh September of last year

83
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,720
so on then %ah

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,470
the ideas were still kicking around in
my head and so well back in March I was

85
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,560
directing an off-broadway play

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,410
and Doc cupo was playing a part in the
play

87
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,130
and Dom bravery in stakes came down to

88
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,759
%ah see the play and afterwards we went
up

89
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,889
for food and we I cope pitch them this

90
00:04:55,889 --> 00:05:00,130
idea about the attendee met the day then
how we might put together

91
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,020
and I because I think we were talking
about the bill the printer project that

92
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,650
truth was doing where they were trying
to build

93
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,669
a giant printer that prints the side of
a building I

94
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:13,258
I don't know what the says is on that
project but I it seem like a great idea

95
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,560
to get people together to do

96
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,949
a cool little technical project that you
can show the conference and

97
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:22,360
so that's kind of where this got started
in a week later was my

98
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,340
birthday party and we got like 20 more
people interested in it just kinda

99
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,759
snowballed on so then the the call for
papers came out

100
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,020
for hope and on

101
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,530
I submitted proposal to talk about the
project we were doing in the

102
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,180
the email came back are there to talks
about RFID

103
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,690
or a are rather other two are for the
projects

104
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,860
and %ah so it turned out that time and
I'll have been wanting to get the CCC

105
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,789
system that

106
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,159
militia developed on over

107
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,289
to hope and so we started to look in
that system and

108
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,340
stakes in open fly and I went and that
with a manual and Bernie

109
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,770
at nada con and our talk about the
system and we're just kinda sitting

110
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,479
around a big table throwing ideas back
and forth and

111
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,159
right there and then you'll put about 12
grand down to buy the RFID tags and

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,300
so that's how the project kinda got
launched

113
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,349
up we'd crunch numbers about Donna

114
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,440
the Motorola 915 megahertz system

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,960
that its kinda range I think up about a
half a meter

116
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,599
little more than half a meter so we're
gonna put little

117
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,310
boxes doors but militia system is up
about 50

118
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,789
meters are in your so much longer range
but %uh the

119
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,349
motorola system was also passive so our
system is active its gonna battery

120
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:45,770
actually sends out a signal

121
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,639
the passive systems get hit with the
signal and they sent something back but

122
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,750
there's no power source on them

123
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:54,879
from so %uh the project at

124
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,520
in its current form is not exactly what
I had in mind when we got started

125
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,539
i'd a we definitely dropped in person
ice-breaker element

126
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:08,860
but on the new system allows you to

127
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,940
put in your email and phone number and
then

128
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,949
pulling your interests and when your
interest match up with someone else

129
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,080
then it will email it will

130
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,620
tell you that you can connect to these
people and then you can tell the system

131
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:22,960
that

132
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,389
send them your email address and phone
number at the conference so you can meet

133
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:27,560
up with them

134
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,020
on so that's for the whole website
that's been built in all that stuff

135
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,060
on so thats basically out

136
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,229
um it took off for months

137
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,360
which is not allowed development time
for something on the scale

138
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,490
and we're actually still debugging on it
today

139
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,550
on were hoping to have it

140
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,789
running up like we have dreamed it would
work by this evening

141
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:57,139
so stay tuned in da we're gonna get the
public terminals downstairs

142
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:00,419
up and running so people can log in and
check it if you don't have your laptop

143
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:01,128
with you

144
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:04,940
so um joins sup you now is a

145
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,419
a statics who's been doing the database
stuff and comparing interesting things

146
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:12,960
and %uh Christina who %uh did the
website layout

147
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,129
and has been working on visualizations
so

148
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,199
no I don't think there's DVI adapter if
we have it in the house a place in the

149
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,199
a trip found a sticks want you

150
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,659
get started and tell us a little bit
about

151
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:32,460
the database and the interest in all
that stuff how's connected

152
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,480
a teacher arm first of the many people
who try to log into the I would say

153
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,020
right now

154
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,699
a case with and now you're working on
some stuff from

155
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,780
this is the first deployment we've I've
done as much testing as possible

156
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,170
but it is the first deployment to the
system and as such we're gonna run into

157
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,329
a couple little glitches

158
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,540
so it's nothing Berg and a working on

159
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,740
yeah yeah it's actually really fun time
it's a lot less stressful than it's been

160
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,580
for the last week or so

161
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,160
arm as far as the

162
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,949
the web kind of division that I had when
creating the database structure is

163
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,110
looking at sites are what are some of
the popular social networking sites you

164
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:11,750
God

165
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,460
arm or some other myspace your myspace
you

166
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,800
Facebook OK Cupid

167
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,840
are who how many people use Facebook

168
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll come on come on don't be shy now I
a lot more

169
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,890
space of

170
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,040
it and is also so it's likely dunno what
those dues they take people make them

171
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,990
together

172
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,080
um looking at different web sites like
Flickr is a popular one you can store

173
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,250
images and you can assign interest tax
to these images

174
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,490
and we realize that these images are
basically objects

175
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,830
that have interest tax assigned to them
and the route we took is that people

176
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:54,900
can effectively be viewed as objects in
this database

177
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,140
so if we have the person who logs in and
they choose interest that's a sign in

178
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,069
interest tax

179
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,170
to the people and then with people we
can do all the really cool data mining

180
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,510
infrastructure stuff that

181
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,569
Flickr and all these other sites are
doing and on

182
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,270
additionally we have every talk would
actually a

183
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,500
one of the guys working on the data
mining captain for your his sleep right

184
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,190
now because he was up until like 9 a.m.
working on this

185
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,190
he a.m. painstaking least to click six
hours a month through every talk at the

186
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,500
convention assigned two or three
specific interests to them

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,850
so when you log into the website and

188
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,080
it'll be ups and its when you log into
the website

189
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,530
you will see I'm of what's called
recommended talks which actually takes

190
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,930
the interest that you selected and shows
you talks that you might be interested

191
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:42,900
based on that missus powerful because
this convention is used as a hundred and

192
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,740
three tracks or something like that

193
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,710
and one of the biggest problems I've had
with conventions

194
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,340
is I find it find out after the fact
that there's a talk that I wanted to see

195
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,250
or not something cool that I was
interested in and I never

196
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,200
I never knew about it so this is
actually really cool way that we can get

197
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,060
around

198
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,540
and we can take the 103 talks unfiltered
on a lake

199
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,219
maybe turn and based on that you can I
actually slipped to talk so you're

200
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,760
interested in

201
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,060
see what else we wanna know that
delivers

202
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,810
like there's there's a ton of stuff from
odeon what's what's 100 luck to

203
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,260
system was on its PHP running on Oracle
server

204
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,720
arm which shows Oracle we actually were
using another system which has Oracle

205
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,000
because the

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,900
yeah we're using my skill how Oracle has
much more powerful aggregation and data

207
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,720
mining features so we'll be able to do
cool things

208
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,280
arm like for example in every track we
can show the

209
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,270
distribution interests that are going
across so we can cross-reference that

210
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,420
with things like age

211
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,520
or even where you're from bomb

212
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,910
as far as privacy I know this is going
to be really big concern because

213
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,620
why the hell would you give us your
phone number I'm seriously right

214
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,110
on the phone numbers if you choose to
enter them a ring cryptid with the

215
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,580
bluefish governments tracked encryption
so in the effect

216
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,410
in the event the the Davis does get
compromised and see how that would

217
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,270
happen

218
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:09,840
by nobody Fla

219
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,080
did the key is stored I'm not telling

220
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,630
I

221
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,260
such Rd

222
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,150
I

223
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:32,050
what are basically that database and all
the other stuff is on the back end

224
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,570
another view am so there's no possible
you getting into it

225
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,680
so I have cost showing yeah

226
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,470
seriously guys everything ok totally I

227
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,560
no a senate here please try to hack the
site let's see what happens if you're an

228
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,490
absconding couple other things on a
couple times and the its

229
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,180
come up pretty well we r if you come up

230
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,770
like in the initial national Ron the

231
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,449
the web for bodies we came to you very
little

232
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,700
so if you guys would like a challenge
and

233
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,020
want you hack site do not DDoS a

234
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,380
yeah no de dos okay get out here his

235
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,350
node DoS attacks no Harbor Rd tossing
devices

236
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,660
either on that's permitted by if you'd
like to try

237
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,579
creative ways to act this site go for
and if you know Dan Kaminsky is dns

238
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,250
exploit don't use that on us

239
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,010
yuck %uh

240
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,150
Kristen 120 talk about how we were
trying to do with his

241
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:37,770
mom lolol originally trying to do with
his

242
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,000
is kinda came to do a crowd mapping
scenario

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,200
where we track everybody by there are
five the tags

244
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,490
and using a map %uh each the floors

245
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:52,540
we can visualize how many people are in
each room at any given time

246
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,110
and also what the general crowd movement
is on

247
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,950
whether we have say congestion by the
elevators whether the

248
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,390
the rooms are packed during particular
talks

249
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,050
and what the crowd movement down on the
mezzanine is around the vendor tables

250
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,070
on we we wanted to

251
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,130
had certain things like picking out %uh
particular vendor table and

252
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,160
seeing how many people were there within
the space of an hour

253
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,410
any given point in time and like things
like that

254
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,329
on right now we're still trying to get
the visualization up cuz we're still

255
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:29,570
implementing all readers

256
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,760
did does anyone have DVI to VGA

257
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,990
yeah I and the easy I on my Mac

258
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,990
just bring up yet year that would be
great

259
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:49,490
actual you I

260
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,450
the last night thank

261
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,530
scholar and yeah proper mack wanted

262
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:03,819
damn hackers or a cure he's carrying
those connectors

263
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,940
%uh milosz oh won't you talk about open
the can and while she's going so we have

264
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,819
a projector and marketing project

265
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,679
pay their ego up no

266
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:17,980
okay so I will give you a brief
introduction into open beacon

267
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,749
I am basic idea also behind open Beacon
is to create a very low cost

268
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:27,339
a generic HF transmit and receive a saw
all the texts you currently have

269
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,529
also able to a transmit and receive so

270
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:36,329
there is a general purpose probing
adapter connector for microchip

271
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:40,279
CPU's see in case you interesting to
update the system aw

272
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,480
create new firmware for example creating
sniffer tax that's can visualize amount

273
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,040
of people around you and stuff like that

274
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,139
and I don't hesitate to come to our
table and

275
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:52,559
we can guide you how to a change of
amber

276
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,939
so the current implementation of the
Tank Girl

277
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:00,490
it's pretty simple it constantly
transmits you I D

278
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,929
up to make sure that no one can spoof ID

279
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,809
every packet a contains a sequence
number and the whole package as blocking

280
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:09,519
crypt at

281
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,519
by using Eq 60 EA encryption

282
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:15,579
its guarded by 128 bit

283
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:19,910
key and it constantly transmit packets
and round robins

284
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,540
transmit strength between four different
levels

285
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,819
and the basic idea we did for distance
estimation is

286
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:30,999
to verify if for example a

287
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:36,059
Ste a strong a packet and the week
packet arrives at the given reader

288
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:39,549
then you can be pretty sure that you and
your to the reader and if you get on a

289
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:41,110
strong package the obvious the

290
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:46,309
far away from the reader and even though
we have only for power level it's

291
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:49,600
weekend estimate also fine grained

292
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,230
distance by using statistical is this so
that

293
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,619
Texico NTR in possession transmit
something around

294
00:16:56,619 --> 00:17:00,449
h2 10 packets a second a

295
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:03,519
labeling something at every fall off
packets

296
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,490
whatever it picking up to about that 100
percent and

297
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,529
and better we lost something like three
to four months

298
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,760
continue transmitting so and

299
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,289
if you don't want to be the tracked for
a time because we need

300
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,189
some time offer just remove your battery
so the

301
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,360
design prettier behind a system was that
only

302
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,809
if you me to be tracked if you for
example 12

303
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:34,120
find out what people that obtaining same
talks you

304
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,679
and you feel better in but if you will
want to be on your own and you don't

305
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,440
want to know

306
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,480
away you are you don't want to know
people where ya

307
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,500
then you're just remove battery so I
think this is though

308
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,620
10 the goods if I D system because

309
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,820
you in full control what happens with
the the date of

310
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,520
Wendy to its gathered and busy you

311
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,690
will seek you do next is what we will do
with fewer details

312
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:01,270
um your that's been

313
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,559
what did you do with it at the
conferences in CCC much different here

314
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,029
I am the AM what we've did their
research 32 users Asian

315
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:14,029
of the building a we had to guy that did
the

316
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:18,990
the amazing a a 3d model of the system
down to

317
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,010
the slightest the aborting a wall a

318
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,450
and a basically you were able to a

319
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,510
move virtually throughout the building
and click

320
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,850
via touch screen on people and you could
see

321
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,320
a are the a.m.

322
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,350
handle and me

323
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,880
we were able to tell where people are
already given time

324
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,970
ok up yeah

325
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:51,620
are two things I wanted to touch up upon
lexicon mention that the

326
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,200
King idea %uh before I just want to make
sure that it's clear

327
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,740
what a ping is is when somebody shows up
like a similar user to you who has

328
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,220
shared interest you see two icons like
southern am on

329
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,350
one of them is a picture via email and
the other is like this cloud that

330
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,330
supposed to be for a

331
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:11,129
SMS and what happens when you click on
those icons that you click on the email

332
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,299
the system will send them an email with
your email address and

333
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,840
and for the cell phones it will send
them a text message with your

334
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,010
cell phone number and that's all it does
and a it also sets a flag in the

335
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,139
database you can only

336
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:26,970
actually something one see Catholic mail
bomb somebody those really big said

337
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,200
concern tryna Middleton

338
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,600
malfunctions the other thing that which
I suspect it did you touch upon the

339
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,780
database clones and it'll

340
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,090
for don't know I haven't talked about
here we're gonna get to that later

341
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,389
um with with him I can talk about it
right now

342
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,799
yet after this project basically all the
source code is going to BG peeled

343
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:49,220
and on regards to the data because

344
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,200
this is a really cool opportunity to do
experiments on and I'm sure universities

345
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,070
and whatnot might be interested in
seeing

346
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,090
precisely what we can do in the crowd
we're taking offers

347
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,789
it but when we cross reference like
interests and details like where

348
00:20:03,789 --> 00:20:04,879
somebody is from

349
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:08,240
with the talks that they want to induce
migration habits you can

350
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,490
form some really cool ideas at on
there's also the concern about privacy

351
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,980
so things that

352
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,490
we consider personal information that
would be a like a a phone number

353
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,840
for example what else we consider phone
number in the handle and

354
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,100
yaa and the handle basically we saw it
happen when air well leaked all that

355
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,330
data in the broken into or something
people were able to take

356
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,020
which time yeah I'm this isn't the
nineties

357
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,289
is boy people are able to take

358
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:40,200
search inhabits in in for exactly who
that was based on that

359
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,639
so we're trying to strip away as much
personal data as possible and still make

360
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:45,059
it a valuable resource

361
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:48,510
so I know there's very very privacy
concern and I want to address the fact

362
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,179
that

363
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,299
we definitely know about that up next
thing we can was collected a

364
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:57,408
Christina with them but system mom

365
00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:01,480
is anything you have a mic yep anything
you want me to touch on a particular

366
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,909
just to walk through it

367
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:06,309
not just show the system and and what
you think is interesting about it

368
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,908
alright on all show show you can see

369
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:13,610
thanks a show you can see without being
logged in

370
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,870
obviously here's the login screen on

371
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:22,240
if we go to you the schedule page what
we have your is

372
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,620
as the schedule setup by room

373
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,510
for each day so you can see it and say
you wanna

374
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:37,510
you talk detail in I think don't think
all the talk details are in

375
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:41,639
I think it's a for the there's a day to
this thing that michael's working on

376
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:45,549
Kaka rights is a the database is being
worked on but

377
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:48,840
when you open that that will show the
title the talk the abstract a bit and

378
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,199
then

379
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,610
anger and the speaker BIOS for everyone
is Anna

380
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:59,520
so that's how it's supposed to work on
you have frequently asked questions

381
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,070
on are visualized page again we're still
configuring the readers

382
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,490
for the second floor what we were
planning to have

383
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,409
was this map that you can view and then
over it

384
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,370
will be a little real-time visual as a
visualizer

385
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,149
with basically dots that represent each
user with a tad

386
00:22:19,149 --> 00:22:23,629
moving around the space and we have a
lot to readers down there so

387
00:22:23,629 --> 00:22:27,600
this will be a little simpler on the
eighteenth floor

388
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,760
were mostly doing on

389
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,129
weather map style like room
concentration level so see you click on

390
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,289
ingress year and you get a room detail
what's going on in the room who's doing

391
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:41,070
the talking

392
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,570
and you'll be able to get how many
people in the room at the time

393
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,700
if you want to login canady test login
for this

394
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,080
to show them how the schedule looks on
the London

395
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,270
toward doing

396
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:06,860
year its the

397
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,330
sitter is your so now when you're logged
in

398
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,449
you have a bunch of commercial
information

399
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,590
that is you need to you

400
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,260
you can view your schedule what talks
you picked

401
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,090
on well when you when you create a new
account

402
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,939
you put in your personal information you
pick your interest in you get

403
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,899
recommended talks

404
00:23:30,899 --> 00:23:35,250
on based on what those interests are and
what you can also do let me show you the

405
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,659
schedule

406
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:41,539
is you can checkoff now there's check
boxes now that you're logged in you can

407
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:42,679
check off

408
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,490
which talks you wanna see quick update
schedule and then you'll be

409
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,119
send reminders to go to those talks that
you're interested in

410
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:57,049
on also now you can view on to chill
again you can view

411
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,510
new users that have just logged in or
you can

412
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:06,020
choose interest in your profile

413
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,210
and basically just a little bit of
personal data

414
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,230
you choose your interest you submit

415
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm can I change your can empower

416
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,139
for and

417
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:25,149
so say I just pick five random

418
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:31,700
things

419
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,269
see we have

420
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:43,830
no interest

421
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:47,658
is you can see this is a still we're
still patching up some bugs in a

422
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:53,309
you that's cool that's when I didn't
know about so well known and we know

423
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:54,100
there's a

424
00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:01,100
accurate checking what's the SMS system
you're using Christian mister ricks

425
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,860
can answer that better than I can the
SMS system that we use an arm

426
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,900
the provider drop down is inherited from
there's a table on

427
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,419
and the database with the provider name
and email addresses and if you put in

428
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:15,140
your cell phone number at an email
address to calm

429
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,679
for example you know 1234 at on

430
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,740
what text %uh ATT dotnet something like
that and use in the email

431
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,030
the system will actually take that
forward as a text message to a cell

432
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,399
phone

433
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,440
so that's how that's working it's
actually really simple

434
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,909
we're we're using a new system like text
email or something

435
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:35,940
would that I was a then school yeah ok

436
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,370
ok at and he didn't really work for what
we were trying to implement this was

437
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,179
very simple

438
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,090
Anders much easier to troubleshoot some
ok arm

439
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,370
you have anything else mom

440
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,010
we're going to have games with those are
dependent on the RFID readers gathering

441
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,470
data

442
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,340
again that's going to be depended on
that set up being finished on

443
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,610
to know it's not quite ready yet

444
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,480
but the the game is going to be based on
a

445
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,049
where you are how many talks you attend

446
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:14,179
you have a score that counts down and
more talk to attend the more points you

447
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:14,559
get

448
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:20,580
basically I'm and at the end of the
weekend whoever has the most points

449
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,570
like win some prizes ok it

450
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,000
also Matt was signed George love the
infrastructure

451
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,549
with retrieve his at work right now so

452
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:34,720
not want you saleable about now what
we've lil

453
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,730
okay so infrastructure a

454
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,130
my co-lead is actually at work because
he has a job what a concept

455
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,169
a anyway hmm since I'm not at work I'm
here to talk to you about the

456
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:50,190
infrastructure and what is different
here

457
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,530
that was not implemented over at the CCC
in Germany

458
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,600
%uh biggest portion of this

459
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,909
thats a that's the difference is the
triangulation

460
00:27:00,909 --> 00:27:05,880
and of course the social networking
aspect which was mostly controlled by

461
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,399
the database saying and our data mining
guy

462
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:13,070
caption for your I need to mention this
guy incredible

463
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,120
data miner and he's he's definitely PhD

464
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,120
absolutely so I in any case

465
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,659
um a few challenges

466
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:27,990
getting enough people to you wire things
up

467
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,010
getting enough people to you crimp
cables and put readers

468
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,030
into you the particular places that
there can be some proper

469
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,260
triangulation we can go with another
system like

470
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,429
quad regulation because we don't need to
know where people are within

471
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,250
two-inches' a worthy actually are so we
just used

472
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,659
some basic triangulation to give a
general

473
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:53,600
overview of where the person is
according to area as you've seen on the

474
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,980
screen when Christina showed you the

475
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,360
a the areas like to honor and hopper in
all the different conference areas

476
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,520
um in any case

477
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,929
a this system setup was

478
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,809
rather simple basically you need

479
00:28:12,809 --> 00:28:15,889
the couple elements one being that

480
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,750
you have 1x of course or any type love

481
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:22,870
UNIX operating system and

482
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:27,940
you have an aggregation system the
aggregator will then

483
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,970
send all the data from the readers

484
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:34,679
and it will just commits the database
after

485
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,830
the aggregation process takes place and

486
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,309
the triangulation is then turned into
you cornets

487
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:45,178
which then we can get a reads on where
people are

488
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,090
why can't we just take the the data that
straight from the readers and put in the

489
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,049
database want one

490
00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:54,129
have to go through something because the
data that comes out the readers

491
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:57,679
is not English so we needed

492
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,010
we need to switch it to actual cornets
so we can get

493
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,320
inches and fee and where people or

494
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,980
so it's combining the information from
multiple readers yes that's correct

495
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,669
script San don't have any questions
about you know

496
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:16,679
my I think there's some microphone over
there if anyone

497
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,690
wants to line up in Nob Hill us

498
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:23,309
%uh there's love implications about dr.
up please go to the microphone if you

499
00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:24,379
have a question

500
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,549
on that is a microphone right

501
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:34,908
aka

502
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:36,590
you

503
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:43,350
is done

504
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,380
alright as far as the a hardware setup

505
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,380
how much did each one receivers cost and
about how many are there

506
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,440
%uh millage cancer than how much

507
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,170
how much did the you what cost the
receiver does the return code readers

508
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,750
readers yeah milosz the readers are
custom made by us they are not

509
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,809
public is so sold yet but us the

510
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:08,760
estimated cost lose something like two
hundred to two hundred fifty dollars

511
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,820
something like that

512
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,510
the basically provide power Ethernet
support so

513
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:18,379
their pretty easy to distribute around
the facility because you only have to

514
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,750
connect the ethernet cable

515
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,800
and the basically are very stupid they
just pick up stuff that's a

516
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,010
comes in on RF side and blindly for
what's the encrypted packets

517
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,129
a gator and on aggregate and knows the a
secret key and the idea

518
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,550
the crypt it and forwarded to all
clients that will do for example the

519
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,629
position estimation and so on and

520
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,870
just for information for community
purposes if you want to play around with

521
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,050
this technology there is a much cheaper
possibility

522
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:54,240
we have also for I'll a very simple
design which is based on USB

523
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,680
it so often be USB project and this is
something I could

524
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,110
eighty five dollars a South and you can
for freely change the film for its a

525
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,309
32-bit ARM

526
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:08,250
processor and you have a serial
interface

527
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,460
over USB so you can have your reader

528
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,160
the basically can turn your laptop to a
reader and you can walk around

529
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,770
the building so in case you're
interested to play around this

530
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,750
technology you can

531
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,830
a lend some other readers at

532
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,040
the MP project from us and

533
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,960
you can for example tried to riding on
softer for a laptop and

534
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,610
if you have any interesting ideas please
share them with us

535
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,750
we have about 50 readers throughout the
building things arent yeah

536
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,640
guarantee their 150 read as and you know
where can they get

537
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,920
the USB is its on the website to order
them

538
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,350
a year ever on on open be kind of upside
there

539
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:50,360
you can also download this from
schematics

540
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,559
and if you want you can build your own

541
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:57,600
design biz amid the the sinus published

543
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,940

firm Renaissance license under GPL
license a

545
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,379
you don't have to pay for any kind of
program equipment

546
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,000
its unbreakable you can problem it over
USB so

547
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,309
I think you're the initial costs are
basically on the

548
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:20,850
the device so yeah onyx

549
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,900
guys I'm I have a two part question

550
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,230
the first one is did you have any
problem and how did you

551
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,330
find a solution to discriminating
between

552
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,510
%uh floors above and below you in this
case

553
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,450
and the second parties did you have
trouble filtering out any ambient noise

554
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:37,880
it was

555
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,660
baby outside your your project area I'm

556
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,830
units my address are first yeah

557
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:49,879
sorry I might be able to address the
part the first I was working on the

558
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,970
visualization part

559
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,030
arm originally we had designed that
would have

560
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,750
readers all over the building so we were
expecting to have a sort of cube or

561
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,540
volume

562
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:04,149
and in that case we would view squad
regulation I however as time progressed

563
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,190
and as time

564
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,950
can diminished %uh we decide to go the
triangulation system so

565
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,080
it is possible for some for example to
be on the 19th floor on the roof or

566
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,580
floor below and penetrate through the
floor itself

567
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:21,490
arm will happen it'll appear but

568
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:26,690
we just assume flat model but there is a
very simple solution

569
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,690
for this so have as long as I have at
least one read on each floor you can

570
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,920
discriminate it so if

571
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,790
you get lot of the week packets on one
floor than you

572
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:40,490
know that if you pick up only strong
packets on the Flowbee law

573
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,299
or a bus when you don't then you are
sure that you are not

574
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:48,549
on the floor below or above so just so
you have to make sure thats

575
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:51,850
in the underlying in route

576
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:56,060
flaws you have additional read at least
and then you can easily discriminate

577
00:33:56,060 --> 00:34:02,710
other rooms on floors an

578
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,290
yet and dressing nicer and the system

579
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,580
X who works at 2.4 gigahertz so what we
basically did

580
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,520
the we move to our frequency to the
upper end of the as AM band

581
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,389
the it's currently a tool for 81
megahertz

582
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,949
and their you have very few nice it's a

583
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,169
inside the got banned of Bluetooth and a

584
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:30,520
it's basically you get only some side
bands of

585
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,900
violence lon so we're pretty save this
and

586
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,040
even if a single packets eg break

587
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,480
the system's con other text icons in
transmitting something it packets a

588
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,690
second so if you lose some

589
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,620
it's not a big deal alerts the week and
is committed over time

590
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,250
so we don't regard as a problem in we

591
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:54,080
country didn't see problems with this
for Thomas is a see there's something a

592
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,168
two thousand people in a much tighter

593
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,450
a space like here with the laptops and
also

594
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,450
transmit 2.4 gigahertz and we never had
problems this

595
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,720
its to make up its by the way so the on
now time is very short

596
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,050
so it's hot to jam it actually welcome
to try

597
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:16,390
on at I've had a lot of fun

598
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,049
reading through the be able to
implementation

599
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,810
up the position estimation for previous

600
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,150
iterations projects like this was opened
the can and

601
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:32,600
aesthetics at believe we tacked on IRC a
few weeks ago and you said you had

602
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,980
some fancy new wave doing the

603
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:39,290
position estimation so

604
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:42,410
gene can you guys provide any
information about that

605
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,330
new system that sorry for the question

606
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,470
yeah he's not here aren't you

607
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:52,760
information yeah that that is different
requestion

608
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,900
Raintree Michael lead actually did a lot
of

609
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,930
visualization work as well for his
position

610
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:04,649
estimation so he's real his real genius

611
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,900
so when Richard gets into the car on

612
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,050
we can forward them on to you do you
have a name

613
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,760
Jeremy with John okay

614
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,980
if if you don't if you don't happen to
find bridge jury during

615
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:24,520
this weekend you can email projects have
done that that comes to me and I'll 42m

616
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,910
the questions ok yeah

617
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:33,529
ok just I'm worried dismayed the

618
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,680
a related question you may not be able
to answer but I'm curious you could see

619
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,629
some more

620
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,230
about the coordinate system and how are
you lay things out

621
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,020
how you measure where things are same
same

622
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:50,270
same problem unknown abuses or called

623
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,550
yeah and they are basically two
approaches so

624
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,270
in rooms like this basically you see for
readers

625
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,890
a.m. corner so with tried to a menace to
see people who've

626
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:06,220
a a a with as few as possible meeting
between

627
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,510
so therefore they're usually pretty high
and

628
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,490
he weekend 2x for triangulation but in
other rooms which are not so important

629
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:14,870
we basically have

630
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:18,359
for example in the far room I don't know
the name by heart

631
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,230
Madison and or ozzie the other two was a
room

632
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,410
that we're gonna sing the reader and the
idea is very simple

633
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,649
if you in one room get a strong and weak
packets

634
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:33,560
and in the other room so good on its
strong Pakistan you're pretty sure that

635
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,970
the person is in a single room

636
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,570
so basically you see two concepts widely
combined

637
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,650
some areas are only covered as every us
so we

638
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:45,330
only know that you are in the particular
area and you are not in the

639
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:48,380
Arctic in the up area next to it

640
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,720
about for I think most of the conference
rooms and in the

641
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,400
main hall in the mezzanine level we can
do

642
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,400
the try triangulation because a

643
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,890
you are you can be always seen by at
least 32

644
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:07,259
for read us and what is very important
for triangulation system that

645
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,510
a you don't have any obstacles in the
line

646
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:16,470
asides between antenna so where you have
all these pillars in the mezzanine level

647
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,990
below

648
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,920
the the make triangulation they're very
difficult so

649
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,320
therefore limited triangulation to
basically all open spaces

650
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,520
in do area-based estimation estimation

651
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,200
a fall other spaces so it's a mixed
approach in fact

652
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,190
no I'm this building is actually built
directly over the Amtrak lines and it's

653
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:36,760
equally

654
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,930
Marvel Avenger nearing but there is a
helluva lot of steel

655
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,990
in the structure so growing going
through walls with saw

656
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:49,990
and these were single inside the hotel
Pennsylvania is quite difficult

657
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,040
was like the maximum capacity for one
these beacons me in my

658
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,330
company our fight is cannery a single
point in time

659
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:00,490
are the last time we tried a

660
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:04,930
sing or the third reader can pick up
something like six to eight hundred

661
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,089
packets a second easily we haven't tried
more

662
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:11,180
and same for Orton beaten USB so

663
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,910
I think it can be mixed art currently
the

664
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,220
the on the say limitation is that the
reader us

665
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,960
only have a 10 make a bit you the
interface but I don't think that it

666
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,490
hurts because it immediately goes into a
100 megabits which

667
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,000
and from there to a Gigabit Switch so

668
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,400
a of for hit single I'm the 10 megabits

669
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,490
doesn't count because on-air you can
have Anna

670
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,830
term anyway only to make up its a gay
tube and with

671
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:45,960
a their wrists the one thing that may be
interesting figure to know

672
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,210
we try it's a how easy it's to break it
by transmitting lot of packets the same

673
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,230
time and

674
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,350
we try to measure actual collision so we

675
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:01,210
transmit is something like the 1600
packets at a time and there were

676
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:04,290
X you're very few college and something
like

677
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:07,880
few percents are so so yeah

678
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,970
the basic algorithm behind to avoiding
collisions as

679
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,550
the we wait for a random time

680
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,029
based on the the

681
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,430
a softer a random number generator that
is

682
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,808
fed by a secrets random seed and your
tech ID

683
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:29,130
Anna so basically every

684
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,250
tech waits for a random time to the
retransmit its ID and that's basically

685
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:33,950
our

686
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:38,180
approach to avoid collisions even if for
to text collide

687
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,419
the probability that on the next
transmission network collide again is

688
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,019
over no and given the very

689
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:47,910
shot on how time which is basically now
16 bytes at 2 megabits

690
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,038
so we're looking at two something like
one and a half minutes seconds or so

691
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:55,150
on at a time the probabilities very low

692
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,480
from cialis and and if there's collision
doesn't hurt because the next

693
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,190
packet will come very soon nice thanks

694
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:09,109
yeah just wondering if you head

695
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:12,509
22 exam possible to exit transmit the
same ID

696
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:15,660
what what do you do with that a

697
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,399
if we will to see this then I would
definitely you wanna

698
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,559
how this could happen because the one
person that

699
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:25,640
the a wants to do so

700
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,058
has only two options one option is to
sniff

701
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:32,440
data from another tech and retransmit
said but

702
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,869
then we see it on the incrementing
sequence number for each packet

703
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,549
that someone duplicate its the packets

704
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:42,680
so we can filter them out for example
for example if you see a

705
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:47,430
given sequence number we'd just don't
allow sequin some ability sequence

706
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:48,069
number so

707
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:51,558
you can't do a replay attack so that's
in my opinion

708
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:55,579
that's not possible and the other
approaches you have to know the one in

709
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:56,569
twenty 8-bit

710
00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:02,349
x60 a key so I think you don't have
enough time to brute force it during the

711
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:03,230
conference

712
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,480
would if you intentionally program to
text with the same ID

713
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,410
that seventy possible for example the
USB take a speedy programmable

714
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,670
this one too so it a you will need to
know the key and then you can

715
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,730
programming you from there now we
haven't tried

716
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,359
actually so maybe the manufacture did a
problem maybe the copy protection but

717
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,788
isn't set but we have to verify this

718
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:29,079
we have notified us yet so the copy
protection but is supposed to be set so

719
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,009
gonna supposedly not you the the for
possible to

720
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,370
read out the the

721
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,650
much the microprocessor and gets

722
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,040
hold of the key so I think without a key
you're pretty last

723
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,270
it any more questions

724
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:48,490
key is really random it's the it's not

725
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,900
bed read from a text or something like
that it's from des few random so

726
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:56,540
keep right yeah

727
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,990
go

728
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:04,680
on just yours who manufacture attack am

729
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,910
nervous Chinese manufacturers you have
this time

730
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,890
a a mix from conflict Ronix the guy you

731
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,950
the know for sure the one that created
to be gone

732
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,080
a sodas pointed out

733
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,240
his a Chinese contact which also bill
the

734
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,950
to be gone devices and we had production
over there

735
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:30,010
a busy to decrease costs so what went
well so we are

736
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:34,800
we're pretty lucky about this hint and
to the text before forces to see

737
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,190
congressman basically

738
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:39,530
the built at the berlin-based company

739
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:42,990
singing and the ones that are not active

740
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:46,730
did the more they passes the other tax

741
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,930
no no there there just a printed circuit
boards without the attorney

742
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:53,160
circuits attached yuan and some case

743
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,540
you intrested to build this parts by
yourself the

744
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:00,650
also the from from the previous text and
I think will also release the global

745
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:01,360
fights for

746
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,790
these text to so you can download Garba
fights for

747
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:09,310
the previous second these text from or
beaten website and can

748
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:13,420
a have them built by yourself it's also
open design so

749
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,740
you're free to do whatever you want with
them just

750
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,530
don't cover fights build them in any
quantity and do whatever

751
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:25,510
as: fun and but tell us about it because
most people just use it and don't tell

752
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,670
us about it so we are very curious what
exit do with the stuff

753
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,810
so happy ending it's Kirk

754
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,350
what would happen if you jam the
frequency

755
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:39,650
with high-powered transmitter I am

756
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,730
yes a so you could definitely local
leave

757
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,940
break it but you have to apply the a

758
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:50,060
power constantly so you know if violence
land its

759
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,500
a difficult because %um half in normal
protocol to have

760
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,170
the this approach to it the violence lon

761
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:02,150
interface licence for traffic and then
start transmitting so

762
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,800
its -9 also tries to avoid condition so

763
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,570
yeah you could jam it I think but I'll
yeah it's how to

764
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,970
omits the frequency so you have to pet
should drive I think at least

765
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:18,690
so too a movie or center frequency up to

766
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,550
for 83 megahertz a

767
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,110
fun a

768
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:30,380
know the Christmas won't help at all
this %uh 16 megahertz

769
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:33,800
crystals and there is a cool PLL inside
so

770
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,970
but I think with any reason Atheros
driver

771
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,820
you can I guess move

772
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:45,040
your center frequency up to 24 its three
megahertz 100 last question one last

773
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,600
thing I want to add onto the question
which is a

774
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,350
if you do it will notice our
visualization is designed to follow

775
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,450
people that we see a big gaping hole
somewhere we're gonna know some he's

776
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,310
playing a little trick

777
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,910
%uh you're invited do it I like to see
it but

778
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,279
lock you were curious to see when that's
gonna look like it's a late residence

779
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,790
estimated cost whole thing

780
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:11,120
estimate the cost for the whole thing
there were numerous

781
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,470
so much donated are in hardware terms

782
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:18,550
people with were borrowing so many box
Richford supply to have the equipment

783
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:22,810
milosz a is loaning us all the readers
and dike

784
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:27,380
we got %uh the cable donated by kinda
Michael from

785
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,190
Long Island to has an RFID company out
there arm

786
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,890
and the badge themself love a manual
pitch in about 12 grand to get them

787
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,900
Botsa these things are up seven dollars
will over 70 cities without the battery

788
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,360
in them

789
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,990
not only that but the the system back
ends

790
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:48,290
we've used did you 1 include time with
that

791
00:46:48,290 --> 00:46:51,660
with that cost or our I yeah

792
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:56,700
organizing means higher system for hours
in program for hours when I resigned his

793
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,820
guys you know like

794
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:03,020
18 hours a day kind of thing um I was
actually looking into you

795
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,610
if you want actually do this on
enterprise-level

796
00:47:06,610 --> 00:47:11,200
however there are many applications at
this can be used for

797
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,390
on enterprise level so if you're looking
at it from that perspective

798
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:21,240
you probably want to look at how large
the area is

799
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,680
and how many people are going to be in
that particular area

800
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,290
arm for project we used in Oracle back
and

801
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,590
because love the number its would be
getting

802
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,240
at all times and it has the best
aggregation and

803
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,760
data mining capabilities in my opinion
so

804
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,980
arm frankly the cost really

805
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,090
is is a variable landed changes

806
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,130
yeah so over for for this for this
particular

807
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,000
for this particular zone 15,000 I i have

808
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,690
one last question that and that's for me
lunch what is the purpose

809
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,740
the button that you put in the system I
yeah

810
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,880
there's there's a little fun attacked on
your help people to circle it's a double

811
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:03,490
circle

812
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:06,700
if you have in your bad hum yeah a

813
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:10,800
the office on that a button is a nice
idea but we'd simply don't have

814
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,990
applications for its think he's
interested to coat nice stuff

815
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:17,230
young woman but it's a basic what
happens you see this

816
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,880
a small circle and you just have to show
did with your

817
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,260
from so not with your fingernail but
with your fam

818
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,970
and then it will transmit a flag that is
set it so in our

819
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:32,340
Lockhart's it will appear so what will
we will immediately use it I guess in

820
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:33,550
the israeli Asian sold

821
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,930
in case you are in front of the main
screen you can

822
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:40,299
press this button and what I think what
we'll do is to

823
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,470
that you avatar is increased so you know
him this

824
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:47,070
I press the san it immediately thank you
so you

825
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,350
to see where you are but so they are
actually very cool things you can do for

826
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:52,060
example

827
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,310
you can download the lochside sleater
and for example can

828
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,400
a decide to do bookmarking insides

829
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,980
talks so for example if you have a talk
and oh there is interesting part you

830
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:04,120
just press one button

831
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:09,290
a for a few seconds so this fleck it's
transmitted to get started database and

832
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:09,840
data

833
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,420
a oh you just need a tool that can

834
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,480
for the furthest given time can assign a
bookmark to

835
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:21,060
a video so I think for next conference
but would be

836
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,970
awesomeness if we have a website you can
just enter your tech ID and

837
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:30,740
just jump to your bookmarks a of the
talks he attended so

838
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,210
me with this is a nice approach but can
do all kinds of stuff it's

839
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:38,650
the store tent can't wait for games
whatever so

840
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,610
there is no particular when we were
talking about developing games my

841
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:44,170
suggestion was grenade mod

842
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:47,660
that the person with the most points at
the time good hit the button take points

843
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:49,290
away from everyone else within range

844
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,810
but but I I think that's it we're

845
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:56,980
Canberra Times I wanna adding one more
thing this is kind of a dynamic project

846
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,010
through the duration of the concert you
have an idea that you wanna like pitch

847
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:00,680
and unlike

848
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:05,490
we have all the were taking code yeah so
if you want to contribute its totally

849
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,820
lay open and like

850
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:10,359
please programmers come ons medical
stuff

851
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:17,350
regular basis you so for example we can
also offer someone idea but for salsa

852
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:21,370
posted some the months ago was begun to
create a mood map so in case you like

853
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:21,960
your

854
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,230
articulate auger particular art
installation you

855
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,780
just press this button multiple times
and we can count

856
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,180
in our system call of new precedent
create some kind of

857
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,520
lives move map around the building soul
you know where

858
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,580
their most interesting parts I currently
so but

859
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,880
ok need to be implemented so we people
for this

860
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,790
okay so these are tough to get back to
work snow I

861
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:51,940
because it's not running yet thank you

862
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,380
its on
