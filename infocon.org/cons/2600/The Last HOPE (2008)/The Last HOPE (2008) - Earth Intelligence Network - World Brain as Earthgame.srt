1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,479
you know whatever outta my last speak so
this time I wanna be clean

2
00:00:03,479 --> 00:00:06,660
all so I can save money

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,660
on alright

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,579
is served can you see that properly

5
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:27,089
you see the little pig down in the
corner

6
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:31,089
that's the CIA up

7
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:35,160
with lipstick on it you can put lipstick
on a pig but

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,810
still a pig on yes

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,980
well i ya no that's that's something I

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,430
I'm very frustrated I've spent the last
twenty years trying to help governments

11
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,730
get in touch with the information they
don't have to steal and dumb

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,550
whats app okay on

13
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,800
sold the bottom line here is now I've
started something new

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,300
which is screw governments were gonna
create public intelligence in the public

15
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:03,980
interest

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,249
on and that's where I'm at now eric is a
late sleeper

17
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:11,499
so I'm not gonna give him the arm

18
00:01:11,499 --> 00:01:16,009
book I

19
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:20,719
okay I'm done here

20
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,780

23
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,889
I let's see if we can do page

24
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:36,568
yeah here you know this is this is the
old part the southern old fart

25
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:42,039
okay page down there we go I you all
will notice that I don't look like agent

26
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,569
steel

27
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:46,649
on have you heard the story about the

28
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:50,020
the FBI in Chicago now

29
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,340
alright well I flown in from Australia I
had about an hour's sleep in is a knock

30
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,030
on the door

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:00,060
and it says room service and I said
something effective please go away

32
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,940
on

33
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,000
and there was a plus-size and then FBI

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,590
hey so I got up I was naked

test of and the outside the door where
to football captains in a prom queen

36
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,459
then this was the new generation of the
FBI they quickly discovered

37
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:24,010
that I was an agent steel um and so we
moved on from there but I've always had

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,440
a soft spot in my heart for

39
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,150
not because of that encounter on

40
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,360
you know fucked up

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,660
what is the matter with this thing
alright hold on I realize I'm pushing

42
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,760
the wrong button now

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,720
up it that's what she said

44
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,530

alright now i cant to justice

50
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,680
to let's see if that works at even
better the arrow I can understand

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,690
I can't do justice to all that has
happened here on

52
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,019
and I'm gonna give some gifts to to
Manuel

53
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:27,060
at the beginning a spy improv after he
said his breakfast

54
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,600
on but the bottom line is I was deeply
honored to open this conference

55
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,570
looking like this but with the tie and
it was strobe lights and

56
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,810
cellos by Aphra cellos by Aphra

57
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,540
set to rename it's a country is it
really fucked up country in Africa

58
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,200
someplace

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,769
okay on anyway cello was the voice over
we had this big brother thing little did

60
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:52,519
we imagine

61
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,140
in 1994 arm now I'm gonna be

62
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,700
all this is up to its kinda neat the
juxtaposition of the Scala yard hat with

63
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,170
the

64
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,079
hope logo on and then that's the metal

65
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,319
that i'm gonna be giving him lifetime
metal one of 12

66
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,390
so

67
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:17,780
I'm gonna be fire hosing I'm gonna try
and present to you in 15 minutes

68
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,099
where we're going to try and take anyone
who wants to join us

69
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,700
in the next 20 may I live so long but
even if I don't live another day

70
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,250
I think that were on our way on

71
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,680
this is a wonderful DVD the blue-gray

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,229
all by BBC and the whole point of this
is to start creating citizen

73
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,640
intelligence minuteman

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,599
and women arm we're gonna kick some
institutional

75
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:48,000
ass with true cost accounting Creative
Commons

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,940
I have been ripped off by every major
corporation in washington

77
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,050
for the last twenty years they steal my
ideas they implement them in grotesque

78
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,039
ways that are not cost-effective

79
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,599
on and they have profited from being
stupid

80
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:06,640
and without honor now for those of you
that don't know me

81
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,150
oil Brett 16 years and latin-american
Asia eight more later

82
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:15,180
Marine Corps infantry command and staff
recovering CIA spy

83
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,110
of three feel towards one chasing
terrorists were still totally fucked up

84
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,490
on chasing terrace but

85
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,270
we have a million Americans on the watch
list up

86
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:30,359
you know to others be a no of course not
two master's degrees actually the joint

87
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,460
fusion centers

88
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,680
highly classified facilities were
supposed to be sharing information

89
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,200
States

90
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,700
their closing down they can't find any
tears

91
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,870
and there's no need for any the secret
information because that's totally

92
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,320
irrelevant in podunk

93
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,659
Idaho with the terrorist is Joe after
seven beers

94
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:53,310
okay on yeah actually well now we have a
village idiot

95
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,200
and Anna work from overrunning the
government but OK arm

96
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,490
open source intelligence leaders
everyone know what open source

97
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,479
intelligence is

98
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,890
okay open source intelligence is

99
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,740
decision support that is based solely

100
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,260
on legal and ethical sources and methods

101
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,849
this is not rocket science generals any

102
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:19,669
who was the director the commander of
the central command until

103
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,770
Bush and Cheney came and has gone on
record as saying

104
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,700
that only four percent of his commands
knowledge came from secret sources and

105
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,050
methods

106
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,550
eighty percent came from open sources
and methods

107
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,710
and the other 16 percent if he knew
where to look

108
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,899
meaning who to ask from among the 16
nations the coalition see that came from

109
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,669
open communication in passing on the
number one Amazon reviewer for

110
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,859
nonfiction and that's gonna play a big
role

111
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,450
inspire improv because I'm a try and
connect as many people show up

112
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,690
on with real-world non-fiction

113
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,300
finally in the world's on the advocate
for the aircon Telligent center

114
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,070
and the world's most test of end-user

115
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,159
it a whole no believe me up

116
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:17,250
sometimes a cost me three thousand
dollars at a time on

117
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,390
yeah on okay

118
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:26,339
of now what I'm gonna what I'm gonna
talk to you about today

119
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,140
is um is the earth intelligence network

120
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,960
are I am 24 Kosar 23 other cofounders

121
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,419
including John Roemer who's behind in
Terra

122
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:43,049
in Dom some other very good people have
come together and we've created a social

123
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,409
technical and financial plan

124
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:49,399
for harnessing the distributed
intelligent so the whole earth

125
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,860
this is something I've been working on
for twenty years but I didn't have my

126
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,200
eighty

127
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,200
culminating moment until I realized I
had to turn my back on all governments

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,599
so this is our high level overview it's
delivered for the very first time

129
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:08,580
by to a group very high quality people

130
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,830
and I just wanna say it's been an honor
for me

131
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,159
and I don't think this is the last hole
but

132
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,880
if this hotel doesn't get torn down
maybe we could start with the first

133
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,839
mope which is the movement on planet
earth where you shoot out all the bad

134
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:31,839
up and you keep the good

135
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,360
I thought of that as I was preparing for
this meaning

136
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,520
I now based on my broad reading

137
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,170
these are the key negative trends and it
doesn't take a rocket scientist

138
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,839
to figure this out on but in fact

139
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,240
complex societies are collapsing and
Charles Perrault said it best in in

140
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,080
phnom

141
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,089
living with Iris technology said you
know single simple systems have single

142
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,529
points of failure

143
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:02,930
and I'm saying this not for you but for
the people watch the DVD

144
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,450
all three of them on but simple systems
have single points of failure that are

145
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,600
easy diagnosis

146
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,750
easy to fix complex systems have
multiple points of failure that

147
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,360
interact in complex ways on the way down
are very difficult to diagnose an

148
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,580
extremely difficult affects

149
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,580
well we live in a society

150
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,550
%uh extremely complex systems all built
by the lowest bidder

151
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,180
with the least ethics okay

152
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,690
so we're fucked are and the problem

153
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:36,529
the problem with the an information age
is that unlike the agriculture in the

154
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:39,480
dust related it doesn't degrade
gracefully

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,589
it's either black or white it's either
on or off and the story that the media

156
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,420
is not covering today is the spread of
blackouts

157
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,589
the spread of energy shortages and
brownouts and so forth

158
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,990
they're also not properly covering the
loss of water but will

159
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:59,750
talk about that another time the Zacks a
goner access man

160
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:05,040
the more we cement over flood plains the
more we ignore the natural nature of the

161
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,959
earth

162
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:11,380
the more severe and the more frequent
will be our natural disasters

163
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,510
in our government is Katrina amply
demonstrated is simply close

164
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:20,950
changes on the earth that used to take
ten thousand years now take three

165
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,990
which means we have to get to real time
science but the extremist republicans in

166
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,480
the american fascists there's a book by
that name

167
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,380
have been waging war on science they
can't deal with reality

168
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,240
finally we have shock capitalism Naomi
Klein is one of my favorite authors

169
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,090
she's really done a good job both with
no logo in shock capitalism

170
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,740
and I have to tell you about five years
ago wall street realize that the only

171
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,510
profits it was gonna make war on the way
down

172
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,480
they already know this stuff the site
stupid people these are really really

173
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,150
smart people

174
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,209
and the hedge funds are starting to bet
on collapse and that's why they all have

175
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,990
hideouts in Dubai

176
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:04,580
which is the new Switzerland riddick
Cheney has 79 versions waiting for

177
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,710
up

178
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,530
up life well first

179
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,270
deadly using the term loosely on okay
political corruption is ascendant

180
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,930
and we don't need to spend a lot of time
on that now the good news

181
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:27,930
and I am somewhat of an optimist is that
there are positive countervailing trance

182
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,780
they cannot put all of us in jail

183
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:36,959
up no no i've been promised that no
arrests will be made until I'm done

184
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,560
speaking on Saturday

185
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,080
are at which time I expect to be
arrested with you and it will be an

186
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,820
honor

187
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,680
on now you ok I think lower

188
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,650
yell cut bank clerk has written a
brilliant book called wealth of networks

189
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,400
and Lawrence Lessig because a lot
smarter than I am

190
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,470
has been raving about it which is why I
bought it and read it

191
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,800
and in essence god bless Richard
Stallman on the open source software

192
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,220
model is scaleable an extendable to
everything we do

193
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,250
and I'll be talking about that a little
bit however

194
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,030
were coming of six hundred years 12
negative

195
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,260
and the forces of evil are seriously
entrenched

196
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,830
retaking our government our planet will
require extreme

197
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:28,950
hacking K

198
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,110
good news regardless of who wins I mean
both these guys are clowns

199
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:39,310
okay Obama is a is a rupees arrogant he
grew up on the south side of Chicago

200
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,510
which makes tammany hall look like Goa

201
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,630
a really nice girl from upper New York

202
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:50,550
on and John McCain god bless em is an
honorable man with a bunch of clowns for

203
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,820
staff

204
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,750
and these guys are trading sound bites
and platitudes they don't have a

205
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,390
holistic architecture which I'll get
into here

206
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,130
on and they literally are

207
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:04,360
unfit to lead

208
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,420
they've qualified to run for president
but they're unfit to govern

209
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,260
because they don't have open minds they
don't listen they don't have a model

210
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,480
analysis they don't really understand
how to create a balance budget

211
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,030
all they wanna do is get through four
years and then eight years have all the

212
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:18,900
perks

213
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,680
and and hopefully keep their head up
their ass

214
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,870
arm bad news

215
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,040
nothing the United States or Europe do
in the next four to 10 years will make

216
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,219
a difference on less

217
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,500
we create a model that Brazil

218
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,080
China India Indonesia Iran Russia
Venezuela and while cards like the Congo

219
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,220
which is as big as the United States

220
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,590
unless we create a model that they can
adopt

221
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,200
that will create seven billion billion
years without consuming the earth

222
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,200
that's the endgame for me in the next 10
years

223
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,670
before we begin this would be funny if
it were not so tragic untrue I'm

224
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,050
intimately familiar with the US
intelligence community in its budget

225
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,040
we are wasting sixty billion in this is
the low number might be as high 75

226
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,709
billion

227
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:20,279
wasting sixty billion a year or more on
the four percent we can steal

228
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,260
now I created this like 1994 net still
valid

229
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,029
we still are not connecting and missus
my third book all information in all

230
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:32,439
languages all the time stock my thing is
that this is just

231
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,970
idiocy believe it or not there is still
no place in the US government where

232
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,660
everything we know comes together

233
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,829
able danger was a very fine program
which did not violate the law

234
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,060
but we had a chicken shit general who
now runs an essay

235
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,890
and chicken shit lawyers who lawyers by
the way in the US government when they

236
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,699
don't know the answer they say you can't
do it

237
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,290
farm and done that tends to actually do
a lot of bad things

238
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,400
on but we don't have

239
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:09,400
anywhere where we can make sense all the
information

240
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,800
can you see this in the back is okay
then I'll read it

241
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,300
it says all of our data is grossly

242
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,290
inaccurate but I need data in order to
manage

243
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,390
arm the second frame says

244
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,160
if I concentrate hard enough I can
forget that the data is bad

245
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:37,980
then I can use it and the third frame
says I have to give him credit managing

246
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,350
is harder than it looks

247
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,600
K I'm not making this up

248
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,590
are we actually have people the US
government including the National ground

249
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,830
intelligence center and everywhere else
who are

250
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,990
their sole job is to fabricate data to
falsify data to manipulate data so that

251
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,420
we can buy systems we don't need cost we
cannot afford

252
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,800
K that's reality

253
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,660
you know I've given a lot of thought to
this these are the seven generations of

254
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,370
warfare if you guys in the back can see
I can help you unless you move forward

255
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,980
on on

256
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,650
but this is really disgusting and I have
to tell you believe it or not the US

257
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,760
military is

258
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,810
at best in the fourth generation I'm in
the seventh generation

259
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,270
I work everyday and 183 languages and my
secret

260
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,569
is is little Filipino boys will do
anything for beer

261
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,700
okay don't go there I

262
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,440
I

263
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,730
the rest is the government to civilian
government is still

264
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,810
in first-generation the US government is
not actually there to make decisions in

265
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,810
create policy in the public interest

266
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:55,300
they're there to protect budget share
and represent the corporate stakeholders

267
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,120
against we the people and the only way
we're gonna beat 'em

268
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,920
is by eliminating the information a
symmetries

269
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:10,660
and the apathy that characterizes our
nation now

270
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,620
Steve Arnold Arnold I T has for over a
decade been my most reliable source on

271
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,510
IT trends and tribulations

272
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,629
and he created the slide less the Google
portion and for those %uh view

273
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:25,780
in the back who I mean if you're having
fun back there and you don't need me to

274
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,420
say so

275
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,260
are but this is his slide that's the
University information

276
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,450
search finds the little yellow stuff
your C Drive and everything else

277
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,220
I'm screen and then text mining now
Google now has

278
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,590
and their two books or analytic studies
out one is called on

279
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,020
on cool something or other and then %uh
the Google legacy

280
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,190
and then the second book is called
Google 2.0 the calculating predator

281
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:58,010
steve is a genius at finding patents
that have been registered an obscure

282
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,030
waste

283
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,639
the fact is Google now has a
programmable search engine

284
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,610
so that you will only see what someone
else has paid for you

285
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:12,700
to see in my book that makes cool just
as evil as Microsoft

286
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,030
perhaps more so because they're dealing
with the substance of knowledge

287
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,680
yeah but if you look at

288
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,940
chapter and and I that he talked about
sir chances I seventy-five search

289
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:26,500
engines

290
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,690
at least and most of them are worth a
shit

291
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,900
okay of yeah I know but let's get
through this brief

292
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,020
okay we have four hours tomorrow night
now expect to see their from

293
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,200
to reality here is that

294
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,380
were completely out of touch with
everything we know where to touch with

295
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,650
historical knowledge with culture
knowledge with

296
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,900
la Legion other languages on and so
forth so tomorrow night I'll answer any

297
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,120
and all questions about Google Microsoft
IBM Oracle

298
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,560
and other actors I had the word losers
here but I took it out

299
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,250
on away processing court its

300
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:05,040
okay I'm not going to spend a lot of
time here there's a whole bunch of guys

301
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,290
like Nova Spivack going around saying

302
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,100
there's this web 2.0 3.0 4.0 in all that
basically

303
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,370
assumes machine learning while machine
learning was oversold in the 1980s

304
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,120
and its oversold today and I'll just
drive that point home by saying that %um

305
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,320
Baffert who's written

306
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,580
two wonderful books on the national
security agency using only open sources

307
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,500
Bamford his second book after reviewing
the trillions of dollars at NSA has

308
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,150
wasted

309
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:37,910
trying to create supercomputers in
artificial intelligence and

310
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,120
your wrist x cost see i three thousand
dollars for me to learn that word it

311
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,580
means

312
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,580
rules of thumb on okay

313
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,280
all the fact is a gem answers book by
saying that one day with another

314
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,010
trillion dollars and I say may finally
create the ultimate computer

315
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,080
which is a very small computer takes
almost no energy and can do petaflop

316
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,149
calculations

317
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,720
per nanosecond and the last three words
in his book are

318
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,240
the human brain K

319
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,080
so my job is to put CA in Google out of
business

320
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,820
by turning away from technology being
substituted for thinking and having

321
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,230
thinking substituted for technology

322
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,890
and that's what the earth intelligence
network is all about

323
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,950
so what is the earth intelligence
network

324
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:28,270
on

325
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,600
it's a strategic vision for waging peace

326
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,990
and assuring prosperity and dignity for
all

327
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,870
and one other things I've learned from a
wonderful book called the fortune at the

328
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,450
bottom of the pyramid

329
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,130
is that the only way to save the billion
at the top is by empowering the five

330
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,970
billion at the bottom

331
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:48,380
we have to turn them into a wealth
creation engine

332
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,460
and CK Prahalad is the one who taught me
that

333
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,490
yeah I and as an infinitely scalable
concept of operations

334
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:00,000
for connecting dots the dots dots to
people and people to people

335
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,410
yeah I and as an information technology
platform for creating the world brain

336
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,800
dot net dot forgot he doing dot com

337
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,760
the eye and as an analytic framework for
creating public intelligence in the

338
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,330
public interest

339
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,189
and finally it's a tool from powering
the public everywhere ending ruled by

340
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,270
secrecy

341
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,639
with online transparent budgets at every
level of governance

342
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,580
including global we are the ultimate
open source mean

343
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,669
we are nothing we control nothing we

344
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,460
earn nothing I've been very happily
unemployed for the last seven months

345
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,730
arm I will answer detailed questions
tomorrow night

346
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,730
I remind you this brief is online are

347
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,300
at WWW dot O S S dot net forward slash

348
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,630
goin in caps and you'll see that at the
end of the brief also

349
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,350
and I'm planning to use most of the time
here on answer questions outside

350
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,360
afterwards

351
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,140
this is our strategic vision there's a
10 page PDF it the website

352
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,440
percent air dash intelligence dotnet

353
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,130
we have allowed our government's 28 nor
reality

354
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,470
are corporations to externalize cost let
me make a point exxon did not make forty

355
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,690
billion dollars in profit

356
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,860
for every gallon gas that we buy for
four dollars they externalize twelve

357
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,770
dollars in costs

358
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:24,120
to the planet and future generations now
how is it

359
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,419
that there is nobody making this point
on any

360
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:30,970
outlet in this country

361
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:35,120
I'll tell you why number one they don't
know it and number two even if they

362
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,419
didn't know it

363
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,720
they would be allowed to say it because
they're bought and paid for

364
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,169
and of course our media has been stupid
and our churches are allowed to cheat

365
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:47,410
and molest instead of healing

366
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:51,390
Gandhi had it right peace is cheaper
than war

367
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,690
and a lot more fun more on that as we
gonna

368
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,860
yea right don't go there either I

369
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,960
alright not great deal of thought went
into this and for those of you in the

370
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
back to top a sustainable sensible
future then you got serious games for

371
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,970
change nonpartisan policy

372
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,530
key concept public intelligence
geospatial foundation

373
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,410
and the glue is not medics and done

374
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,070
the medics and Tom

375
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,139
transitional facilitation whatever that
means on

376
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,830
I think it means huggy holding hands and
having open meetings and open space

377
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:32,168
all that good stuff on now before taking
the next flight which is very

378
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:33,740
complicated

379
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,690
I want to do public interest math 101

380
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:42,830
a document has recently surfaced through
Columbia University here in New York

381
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,370
City

382
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:47,490
it's the game plan that the republicans
developed in the late nineteen eighties

383
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,820
for buying the US government back

384
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,320
and they essentially created a plan with
the budget is $300 million

385
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,570
that would entrench the right kind of
republican

386
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:03,270
I'm of moderate Republican leaning
toward libertarian this is the extremist

387
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,590
republicans now

388
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,590
on they came up with a plan and they
executed

389
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,800
and they won they'd lot from school
house the white house they bought

390
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,070
our government because we weren't paying
attention

391
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,960
now look at the math here cost to beat
them at their own game is roughly $500

392
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,630
million

393
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:26,730
$500 million divided by $25 million
citizens is twenty dollars a year

394
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,060
for liberty subscription

395
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:34,639
five million people at a hundred dollars
a year

396
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,400
same thing I tested this out I'm very
spiel I said screw 100 will give you 500

397
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,040
K that's a different Class A people
that's employed but still

398
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,899
on I think this is very very important

399
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,580
there's absolutely no reason why we
cannot create

400
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,960
and international technical financial
and social

401
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,290
platform that not only berries
governments

402
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,570
but very school and like

403
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,740
if any if you really love cool I
apologize for offending

404
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,560
on now this is it I'm sorry it's so
complicated

405
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:14,129
but the bottom line is that at the very
top you can mobilize peer to peer

406
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,120
financial

407
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,060
power and you can then feed that into a
technical infrastructure

408
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,678
that essentially empowers all web sites
all substance

409
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,440
in ways that allow the aggregate to be
instantly available to everybody

410
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,780
on and there's a does a lovely little
line at the very bottom that are read

411
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,270
it basically is a spectrum of sticky
integrated services

412
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,350
on internet public intelligence public
policy forum's

413
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,790
serious games in real-world budgets I
was taught by my seniors

414
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:49,800
at OMB that it's not policy until its
budget

415
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,340
it's in the budget and the budget has
been executed these two presidential

416
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,850
candidates

417
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:00,220
are basically slinging carefully crafted
pieces of crap at each other

418
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,320
and at us and these things have
absolutely no foundation in reality

419
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,129
no foundation in a balanced budget these
guys don't even have a cabinet preform

420
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,409
I mean you know for McCain to rely on
Graham is economic adviser

421
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:18,970
whole ship

422
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,040
now I'm gonna spend a lot on up time on
this but these are 18 functionalities

423
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,629
that we knew we needed in 1986

424
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,620
and they began with ingestion
technologies and sensemaking

425
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,240
technologies our capabilities
functionalities and then

426
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,020
sharing and stuff a member of the West
Coast akers the Silicon Valley hacker's

427
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,200
group to start with the homebrew

428
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,409
clubbin Stewart Brand started it today
Larry Page and I avoid each other

429
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:48,669
are at this meeting are or may be

430
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:52,560
he avoids me are but I try not to not to
get in his way

431
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,710
RF respect on Microsoft has been using

432
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,010
first-rate marketing to sell second-rate
crap and they have also migrated their

433
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:05,730
application program interfaces over the
year you know this better than i

434
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,679
and the bottom line is they have
completely destroyed the ability to

435
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:10,730
innovate on the edges and network

436
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,040
on and so I think we need to be
committed to integrating open source

437
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,168
software

438
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:19,700
open source intelligence and open
spectrum

439
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,830
and all three need to be in the service
of by and for

440
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,139
we the people now that's a little
complicated but this is what we actually

441
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,760
have now

442
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,530
there's no reason why you can't set this
up tomorrow for your neighborhood

443
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,908
there's no reason why your neighborhood
can't be calm

444
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:41,770
a a smart neighborhood in which you are

445
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,030
sharing are we have a shared directly
shared calendar

446
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,990
on virtual shared budget there's no
reason why with all the volunteer hours

447
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,120
that we have

448
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,470
every budget decision coming forward it
impacts on your neighborhood can be

449
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,220
present it to your neighborhood

450
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,770
and an here in the US most people on the
internet but for those who aren't there

451
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,830
can be

452
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:05,908
coffee shops and places like that where
where

453
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:11,659
you can undertake to to brief people who
don't have the access

454
00:28:11,659 --> 00:28:15,440
has anyone heard of two zone

455
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,330
K to lose all was created by a double
PhD

456
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,918
doctor doctor Dave Warner he's both a
PhD in a medical doctor

457
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:28,330
he's one of a small handful of people
have been funded by darpa

458
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,949
for the last several years you can
google for or Yahoo for as I do

459
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:38,300
on I know it's a small thing but on
Yahoo for strong angel

460
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,830
you'll find strong angel three and there
you will find tuzla

461
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:46,908
online you can download it and you can
play with it you can augment

462
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:52,060
what Darpan these guys realized is that
any time a crisis happens in haiti or

463
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,379
anywhere else

464
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,820
all kinds of people come in and their
c4i systems their command control

465
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,370
communications

466
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,990
computing and intelligence or
information systems are all incompatible

467
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,490
so what they created is something that
fits on a thumb drive

468
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,880
that allows you to be immediately up and
running as part of a

469
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,470
a local area wide area network and I'm
not a technical person but I think

470
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,220
that's a pretty cool concept

471
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,649
and I would love to see arm

472
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:25,440
happen hope mope whatever move toward
the content side to the house toward the

473
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,990
sharing in a sense making site at the
house

474
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,310
because ultimately that will call into
question every government decision

475
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:36,178
aren't being made

476
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,500
now I've known dick levinson Brad
Ashford for a long time this comes from

477
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,710
their website maps of science

478
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:45,860
and this particular slide if you choose
to download the download a briefing from

479
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,560
the internet this particular slide is
very very high resolution

480
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,700
on and it allows you to drill down

481
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,730
to to the connections and so forth

482
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,080
so right now what's happening is a
cognitive science which has been

483
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,070
struggling

484
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:05,168
for years is slowly starting to

485
00:30:05,169 --> 00:30:09,720
get a grip on the fact that maybe it's
about humanity not about science

486
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,470
on and at the same time collective
intelligence with charm

487
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,200
big pushes from guys like Tom atlee the
author of TALF democracy

488
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,370
on George poor many others

489
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:26,230
arm we have a book that of talk about a
minute our collective intelligence

490
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,520
which is us sharing and sensemaking and
agreeing on consensus

491
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,889
that is long-term sustainable that's
that's starting to emerge as a force in

492
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,960
its own right

493
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,580
completely apart from science or
anything else

494
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:43,678
the world brain exist today

495
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,320
we don't need web 3.0 4.0

496
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,480
2.0 whenever we have a world bring today

497
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,690
it's just be on schizophrenic on

498
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:01,679
now I bought three URL's 10 years ago on
my own for the next ten years ago in the

499
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,050
process of working with the University
to get the dot he do

500
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:09,450
URL on but we have a concept

501
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,419
for creating a very low-tech

502
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:17,890
means for allowing every neighborhood
every municipality every county every

503
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,800
state every

504
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,179
government every issues group

505
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,899
to actually start becoming intelligent
okay I mean I love Paul Hawken and the

506
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:31,580
folks who created wiser World Index of
environmental and social responsibility

507
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,649
but the fact is wiser right now is just
one

508
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:38,659
big database of people who have entered
your stuff and there's nothing you can

509
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:39,750
do with

510
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:44,390
I can see on so we need to do we need to
get to where we can do stuff

511
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:49,260
now comes the the the substance to meet

512
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:54,840
I love how we take back the planet and
our government

513
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,149
I had an epiphany that's the republican
word for a hot

514
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:01,659
experience arm about

515
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:06,020
two years ago when the UN high-level
threat panel reported out

516
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,560
and general scowcroft was a member of
that panel

517
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,090
and they said these are the 10
high-level threats to humanity

518
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:18,909
I said yeah I mean for me this was not a
surprise but

519
00:32:18,909 --> 00:32:22,609
for george bush and Dick Cheney who
believe that terrorism is the only

520
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,800
threat

521
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,290
this was a little disconcerting if they
ever give it any thought

522
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:31,940
poverty infectious disease environmental
degradation what is so interesting about

523
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,919
those three threats is that they don't
recognize borders

524
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,169
K if we allow massive poverty in Africa
and eventually creeps into

525
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:45,580
Asia I mean into Europe same thing with
Indonesia for a while there the

526
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,500
Austrians were planting bombs on boats

527
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,760
so that the indonesians would blow up
and round before they reach the

528
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,590
Australian waters

529
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,460
okay there's a lot I really serious
stuff going on out there that nobody is

530
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,950
really seeing in capturing

531
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,470
but this cause me to realize that we
have to create a global network 12 by

532
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,340
and for

533
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,980
We the People because if we don't do
this if we don't help all the other

534
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,359
people

535
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,010
get in touch with knowledge in create
wealth and so forth

536
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,200
then those of our children that survival
be destined to

537
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,109
an airlock kind of environment on

538
00:33:24,109 --> 00:33:27,369
in this I've known this for a long time
but

539
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:30,760
the intelligence community is having a
real problem coming to grips with the

540
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,820
reality that most of what we need to
know is not secret

541
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,178
not expensive and not available to the
federal government

542
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,570
K blue

543
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,080
cell in 1994 I made a round-the-world
trip

544
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,600
my own expense it was great United has
this

545
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,109
this deal with for five thousand dollars
you can make as many stops

546
00:33:52,109 --> 00:33:56,270
in Asia as you want and still be in
business class on but anyway singapore

547
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,580
is the only country on the planet that
listen to me I met with the National

548
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,960
Computer Board Singapore 1994

549
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,020
and today singapore's the world's first
smart nation

550
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,980
on and is a really need initiative
between Singapore and MIT called the

551
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,850
smart

552
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,839
initiative the Nordics Norway Denmark
Finland

553
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,250
Sweden they're slightly behind Singapore
and then the Netherlands is coming up

554
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,280
fast

555
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,800
the United States is now a third world
country in just about every possible way

556
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,679
on that you can imagine and that's
shameful

557
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:32,310
on in the USA Homeland Security Charlie
Allen who's who's the senior member of

558
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:34,279
my very small fan club

559
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,830
on his the undersecretary are

560
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:42,210
a homeland security for our

561
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,510
for intelligence and analysis all he
does is focus on terrorism

562
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,919
and I tried to say in an email I say
look you know Homeland Security's about

563
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,319
poverty infectious disease environmental
degradation

564
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,430
we've got to start controlling the
developers

565
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,649
one other things and I this is a side
note but I i wanna put it in here

566
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,440
I read a book called hunting with Jesus
after Barack Obama's famous

567
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,220
statement about how you know these poor
suckers the drink and shoot because they

568
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,580
don't have anything else

569
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,450
well it turns out he's partly right on

570
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,779
and I'll come to hell slide a few
minutes on

571
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:27,400
but the reality is if we allow
developers to continue to pave over

572
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,550
flood plains we're going to have more

573
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:35,700
flood severe everything okay

574
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,560
so we've got to get our act together now
general scowcroft to I happen to think

575
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,140
is the last adult left in washington

576
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,520
on and I hope he lives for least several
more years

577
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:51,060
that inspired me and so I have and maybe
tonight i'll show picture my library in

578
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,130
my map table

579
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:57,690
on but I I went back through all of the
mandate for change books for the last

580
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,090
five or six presidential election season
we're all these cabinet secretary

581
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:02,270
wannabes

582
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,740
write these these little learn it ten
pagers is how we can

583
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,380
save humanity by giving me this job on

584
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,030
and I realized that there are 12 core
policy areas

585
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:18,810
and today these 12 core policy areas are
represented by agricultural sector by

586
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,990
secretary said the cabinet

587
00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:25,180
who want to do nothing more than protect
budget share

588
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:28,940
and protect vested stakeholder interests
meaning mega farms

589
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:34,109
the guys that are they create massive
cattle farms where the ship gets into

590
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,130
the spinach and then the spinach gets
another tomatoes and

591
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:40,180
you know you know the story okay on

592
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,899
agriculture's outta control solos
diplomacy

593
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,130
I mean I think on the rices invented
piss and diplomacy

594
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:50,550
are a new term love the art on

595
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,490
solely Roman economy education energy
family health

596
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:57,600
all of these things are related

597
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,799
you should not use water you don't have
to grow grain you don't need

598
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,330
just fill a gallon as the Sun all gas

599
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,400
at a cost of like 2,700 gallons of water
per gallon

600
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,130
K this is what's called true cost
accounting we don't do it

601
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:19,990
although Paul Hawken in the national
capital S is another's have

602
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:23,200
I mean family health education

603
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,900
olive this is integrated I find out I
found out hunting with Jesus and this is

604
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,640
why I wanted to bring up here

605
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,950
that across america we have all the
small town fiefdoms

606
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:36,390
in which the elite the Chamber of
Commerce

607
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,259
the City Planning Council on

608
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,200
people like that they cut deals with
corporations

609
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,590
they give them public land n/a gross
discount

610
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:51,640
they give them tax breaks they have no
right to give and then in consequence

611
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,990
they also keep everyone in that little
fiefdom

612
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:58,000
uneducated and medicated

613
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,790
on beer and 20s okay

614
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,920
and so what we have all across America

615
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,720
is some should head elites fitter
screwed over the population

616
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,990
because there's no one there say hey
wait a minute we're the public not you

617
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,369
so we've basically handed over a
birthright

618
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:21,790
to a buncha people now feel privileged
in entitled

619
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,590
I mean I'm not worried about the
entitlement to the bottom I'm worried

620
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:26,800
about the entitlements at the top

621
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,700
okay we need to cut those people off at
the knees

622
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:37,109
most information is not secret but the
US government doesn't really get that

623
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:40,390
I've made this point earlier

624
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,810
nothing we do nothing

625
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:49,850
is going to matter unless we create and
earth game in a model

626
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:53,069
that can be restrained not just the
whole of government but a whole

627
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:57,540
America model they can be migrated to
Brazil and China so for them they have

628
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,140
to want to take it

629
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,290
okay there jonathan shell has written a
wonderful book called unconquerable

630
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,450
world

631
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,869
which is correct Charles arm Chalmers
Johnson is written

632
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:13,119
sorrows a vampire but the bottom line
here is we can't force anybody to do

633
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,420
anything

634
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,080
iraq is the last really stupid war I
hope

635
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,700
and I was in Vietnam in vietnam was a
similarly stupid war

636
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,790
and now literacy surfacing that says we
knew going into vietnam that it would be

637
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:26,349
a

638
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:29,680
ten or fifteen year warren that we have
fifty thousand casualties

639
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,368
but it was considered good enough to
completely justified

640
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:37,750
the rebuilding of the US military and
that's what iraq has done

641
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:43,260
is basically completely justifying the
rebuilding of the US military

642
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:50,260
and that's just nuts so here it is all
put together

643
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,310
policies on the left I'm sorry

644
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,420
threats on the left policies across the
top and the players

645
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:03,050
three-dimensional going back this is
what

646
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,250
are analytic model looks like and this
one graphic it makes clear

647
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,750
both the idiocy if not the mendacious
nice

648
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:17,950
over the past eight years and the
platitude missus nonsense that both the

649
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,520
presidential candidates are presenting
to us today

650
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,950
and I will tell you very candidly that I
thought so much of Obama's

651
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:29,920
that I drove to des moines and the hotel
was full up

652
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,510
and a woman of color at the desk realize
that what I was doing was important she

653
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,660
put me in one of the two rooms next to
Obama that the secret service it blocked

654
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,490
and then at three in the morning I
created a special memo for Obama

655
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,099
and there was a a secret service officer
of color there with me and I showed it

656
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:48,390
to him I gave my SSN I said look I'm
gonna sneak past you guys and put this

657
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,290
under store okay

658
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:54,890
and after he read the memo he said okay

659
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:58,589
on this is good I put it under store I
don't think Obama ever read it

660
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,430
I have come to the conclusion that Obama
is a house Negro

661
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:07,368
that he is a slick arrogant on
non-player

662
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:10,530
on and that as good as he is

663
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:14,609
as a human being and i love his wife I
think his wife is extremely smart and I

664
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:16,890
think she should never have taken shit
for saying

665
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:20,240
for the first time as an adult I'm proud
of my country everybody knows we're

666
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,780
proud of our country in theory but
America right or wrong is a stupid

667
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:28,349
fucked up idea okay allman

668
00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:32,970
and and so I found out very recently
Webster Tarpley Griffin has written a

669
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,310
wonderful book called Obama the
postmodern

670
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:39,710
COO Obama is Jimmy Carter Second Life

671
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:46,030
with brzezinski a poll having one more
war with Russia in him

672
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:49,420
you like Obama you're electing
brzezinski in you are picking war with

673
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:52,940
Russia and possess he so stupid these
days is getting see now he thinks he can

674
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,820
push the Chinese out at the southern
hemisphere

675
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,910
me well yes you can because mccain's
gonna die and then as vice president

676
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,560
becomes president now

677
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,470
I what's let's talk about that I will
talk about that

678
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,960
at spy I am proud that spy improbable do
that okay

679
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,030
I actually have a McCain sticker on my
on my thing but I'm actually betting on

680
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,200
Bloomberg

681
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,770
not running but finding someone to run
and I'm

682
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:22,359
eligible I'm volunteering and

683
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:26,340
I don't think I will ever be elected
president but nothing would give me

684
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:33,030
greater pleasure then the puts spy
improv into the presidential debates

685
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,849
yeah I you I CEO of

686
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:41,030
I alright are good lever

687
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,720
now I inserted the slide to make a point

688
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,970
I was having a talk with some people the
PricewaterhouseCoopers has issued a

689
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:49,970
report recently

690
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:54,420
which is on my website which documents
at fifty percent of what we spend in the

691
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,260
health industry is waste

692
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:02,130
K it's placed at the same time I know
some really smart people who are very

693
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:05,460
discreetly been going on all over the
world and I know that I can eliminate

694
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,550
the medicare

695
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:11,250
unfunded deficit period I can take it
off the books

696
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:14,940
because the stuff we pay for six hundred
dollars here in the US and we pay sixty

697
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,210
dollars in Canada

698
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:19,849
they pay six dollars in South Africa K

699
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:23,200
and the only reason we're paying six
hundred dollars is because the pharma

700
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,770
people bright Congress to say the US
government cannot negotiate

701
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:33,070
for prices but at the same time farmer
is not the answer pharma and surgical

702
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,750
intervention are be the last

703
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:39,530
and let me tell you how to make any
doctor

704
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:44,369
shitting his pants after his propose
surgery to you

705
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:49,540
just say is this evidence-based

706
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,849
we have so damn much elective surgery

707
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:55,900
and surgery that has absolutely no
foundation

708
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:59,630
mean I like John Wayne rich is a good
human being but he got his millions by

709
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:01,609
putting good doctors in jail

710
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:06,190
or impoverishment so that bad doctors
could do more operations at women didn't

711
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,410
need

712
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,790
okay and this is the kind of public
intelligence

713
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,210
that we have to bring up and push out

714
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:19,680
feel like it kung fu artist you know

715
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,980
so this is a little model that I created
one afternoon talking to these people

716
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,660
healthy lifestyle okay these people are
getting fat on 20's forum on

717
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,580
many other reasons we're not holding
these companies

718
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,250
accountable for the true cost what
they're selling

719
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,859
okay the true cost the water sweatshop
labor calories

720
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:47,119
up all kinds a crap the pesticides the
stuff that's in the food that we eat

721
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,550
is unregulated it's virtually
unregulated

722
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:55,230
if course if course but that's a simple
that's that's

723
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,740
that's very plain the fact of the matter
is that the US government should be

724
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:00,420
guaranteeing a healthy lifestyle

725
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,109
otherwise eat local cocaine which is a
mean that's coming up

726
00:45:04,109 --> 00:45:08,799
eat local home rule saw healthy
environment

727
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,070
I mean it is not healthy to live in this
country with the exception of Colorado

728
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:19,140
maybe vermont an organ in portions of
Washington

729
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,790
no now lower Manhattan is where the
aliens live

730
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,630
I

731
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:32,609
up natural alternative re mediation any
Chinese medicine is starting to come

732
00:45:32,609 --> 00:45:35,859
really really big among the really
really wealthy

733
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:38,890
because a really really wealthy can
afford

734
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,319
good information and they're starting to
figure out

735
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:46,310
that there are so many different ways
and in fact it turns out the Chinese

736
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,410
medicine is best

737
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:52,940
as a pain reliever so that you don't do
Pharma

738
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,970
okay and of course Chinese medicine is
also best I had a

739
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,000
a meeting with the guy was saying acid
reflux they wanted to give them all

740
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,300
these things and surgical intervention
went to both the Chinese and Indian

741
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,140
doctor

742
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:10,270
and they said asshole don't eat meat
after 12 and stop drinking caffeine

743
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:14,839
alright so there is a lot of common
sense out there

744
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:18,359
there is a lot of good knowledge but
that good knowledge

745
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:22,589
is being censored there's a book that I
review call fog

746
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:27,310
fax we know this but we don't know this

747
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:31,259
we don't teach our kids in school I miss
school still industrial prison you know

748
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,670
whatever don't get me gone

749
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:37,460
all and then finally we have medical
tourism are and telemedicine and a whole

750
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,630
bunch of other things that we can do
instead

751
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,859
love checking into the world's most
expensive most disease hospitals on the

752
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:45,230
planet

753
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:49,010
okay you're guaranteed the walk out with
three for one

754
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,280
okay he come in with one disease you
leave the three

755
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,480
on okay so this is a book that I'm
thinking I'm toying with

756
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,450
with publishing this book soon and I'll
just leave it up for a minute

757
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,980
but essentially health intelligence this
book here gives you an idea

758
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:08,619
of how we should be thinking about
health

759
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:12,940
as a national security national
prosperity issue absolutely guarantee

760
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,589
you

761
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:16,950
neither McCain or Obama nor anyone
working for them

762
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,359
as a god damn fucking clue that's gonna
cost me a hundred dollars

763
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:24,759
I'll love how to do this

764
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,410
these guys are zombies

765
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,270
and so are we except for the people in
this room

766
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:36,200
K out there are the unwashed

767
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,500
people who are just gone through life
turd durables on a wheel

768
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,349
okay and its its kinda said

769
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:47,400
however I'm somewhat optimistic

770
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:52,060
all I believe did in the next 10 years

771
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:57,470
we can create a earth game and a global
network for sharing

772
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:01,550
information and for multicultural
sensemaking

773
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:05,060
that will provide the eight challengers
with compelling truthful and useful

774
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:08,040
policy

775
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,520
and budget support

776
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,970
and very close to the end we will have
time for a few questions on

777
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:20,210
Singapore is where I believe I wanna put
my center of gravity other New York

778
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:23,180
would do nicely well if broken would
give us space

779
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,470
on because they speak a 150 languages in
Brooklyn

780
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:30,550
and k in the Bronx I can actually speak
anything

781
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,680
up but to him well I

782
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,859
any K K

783
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:42,140
yeah I

784
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:45,900
after I do something like that please
forgive me those three a view from the

785
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:46,630
Bronx

786
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,609
I

787
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:56,609
this I

788
00:48:56,609 --> 00:49:01,609
all right now here's the deal our gift
of life to our children and future

789
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:02,930
generations

790
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:07,690
must be a gift to the earth intelligence
network and the earth game

791
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:12,609
all by and for all the people all the
time and that doesn't just mean us it

792
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:14,210
means everybody else

793
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:19,280
I gave uninvited ranted Paul Allen's
interval corporation back in 1993 I

794
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,980
think it was in ninety four

795
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,490
rob tell who's also a member West Coast
Silicon Valley hackers thing invited me

796
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,720
I'm still very proud of that rant and
it's called god man an interval

797
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,080
on and you can find it easily on the
Internet

798
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,920
and I basically said all your fancy
technology

799
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,180
shit unless it can help a pregnant
mother in India

800
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,279
move the ball forward and so this is
where we need to go

801
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:48,370
okay we're in the process now the United
States is at least six different maybe

802
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:50,109
nine different societies

803
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,860
and I hate to tell this to you but
you're on the lifeboat

804
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,310
with a really big hole in sharks all
around

805
00:49:57,310 --> 00:50:01,840
on and I'm not sure where to survive but
a moderately optimistic

806
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:07,200
I think we can do this I think we can
bury secrecy

807
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,560
I think we can barey spending on war

808
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,460
that we can afford and don't me and I
think we can in fact wage peace as

809
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,210
I used to call this in the nineties
information peacekeeping

810
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:23,760
now the target bill was buckminster
fuller's assistant

811
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,840
in creating the world game

812
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,360
an analog game and I have funded him
this past two years I

813
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,660
my wife still pissed at me I basically
spent my profit for the last two years

814
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:36,839
on creating the earth

815
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,110
intelligence network and then I became
unemployed for seven months and

816
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:43,490
I can understand why she's man arm

817
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,710
I'll you know it's like that crocodile
dundee you know where he goes for a walk

818
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,490
about for 18 months in his wife leaves
me

819
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:53,100
ahead and sue says silly woman denise is
here

820
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:56,180
I anyway it's hard

821
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,589
arm but meh dard is creating a system

822
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:04,070
he's got the architecture the reason we
can't build on the series games that now

823
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,870
exist which I asked him why can't we
plug and play

824
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,920
he said that would be like trying to
connect football soccer baseball cricket

825
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,110
and chess

826
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:15,640
all in one game well yeah whatever

827
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,319
but the point is that if you create a
platform that has standards

828
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,560
then you can create generative new games
on the edges

829
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,180
that will interact and relate you can
create new information modules and

830
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,570
things like that

831
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,590
so we have him positioned where for two
million dollars a year he can build the

832
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,840
earth game

833
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,140
and it won't cost that hey you know
anything more than that and all these

834
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,460
people that say anymore is not and the
promise DOD is in the process is

835
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,300
spending much more than that

836
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,130
to create a world simulation where they
decide what you're thinking

837
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,280
on and this is kinda scary mean

838
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:56,390
online budgets like the national budget
simulation will be embedded

839
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,910
so that individuals can go and identify
themselves only by their zip code

840
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,940
and their political preference okay we
even have by afferent in there

841
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,910
on and then they can see the aggregate
result

842
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:13,950
love their deliberations appreciative
inquiry online stuff I don't know if you

843
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:15,990
guys are in touch with the Seattle

844
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:19,590
tree huggers better doing all the system
was some council stuff but I'll talk

845
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,420
about that

846
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,420
tomorrow night also but the bottom line
is we the people have more common sense

847
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,840
I can run this government better

848
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,850
with a guy a book was written about in
the average American any so cool

849
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:33,770
that when the guy finally went back to
him after two years and said you're the

850
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,300
average American the guy said

851
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,050
how what an honor and that's call

852
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,880
heey intuitively he got it intuitively
he got it

853
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,060
so there you have it now I'm not going
to spend a lot of time on this but

854
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:53,200
ER without you know Wilson and lester
brown and the target belt is publishing

855
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,890
a book seven billion billionaire so now
I me for what we spend vietnam we could

856
00:52:56,890 --> 00:53:00,089
have built a two story cinderblock house
in a swimming pool for every single

857
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:01,370
Vietnamese

858
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,880
and lest you think you'll love the CIA
let me tell you that when

859
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,760
when Johnson decided that he had to wage
war in Vietnam in order to keep the

860
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,290
social program alive the CIA desk
officer

861
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,470
in the analytic side said oh my god he
said ho Chi Minh is a nationalist he is

862
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:18,860
not a communist

863
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:23,240
neg you again GM is a Catholic

864
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,810
a dictator mud on new

865
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:31,009
set class on world bitch until hillary
clinton came along

866
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:34,170
behind Alliance I'm sorry I had to do
that I plan that

867
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,450
all but no new is a murderous now there
are people that say that hillary has

868
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,660
been involved in 50 murders you can find
on the website

869
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,200
all a lot of clinton's security details
been oft

870
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:51,110
on in the past a a fifteen year sigh I
say this seriously in with gravity

871
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,460
a lot of his people who were intimately
familiar with him and his

872
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:57,870
personal preferences and desires
after-hours

873
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,640
are now not on this planet arm you heard
it here first maybe

874
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,730
so this is a real budget now

875
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:10,880
I created this for wiki mania of 2006 I
think

876
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,360
I won't spend a lot of time on it since
we've got six minutes left

877
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,580
on but I do wanna say that it's
unfortunate

878
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:22,319
ditch FB zosyn john chambers and Larry
Page and

879
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:26,580
Jimbo Wales don't play well with one
another

880
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,040
okay there they're really

881
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:35,080
playground bullies in their own way on
and Jeff be so sigh I lectured to

882
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,549
standing-room-only

883
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:41,030
IBM and Microsoft Data 150 each most
people get fifteen to thirty I had over

884
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,470
300 including five vice-presidents

885
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:47,540
I think and I pitched Amazon creating
the world brain

886
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,310
where the top authors on poverty become
the Global Intelligence Council on

887
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,580
poverty and everybody who's interested
in poverty

888
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,460
all over the world becomes the local
observer and sense maker in poverty

889
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,120
didn't want to hear it wasn't an outer
space and it wouldn't fit on Kindle

890
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,270
arm you know I'm very frustrated

891
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:12,380
arm you guys actually made me feel that
this is my happy face

892
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,390
yeah for fix I don't like Steven Seagal
but that's the one

893
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:20,850
peace have acting that was decent okay

894
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,700
now coming to a close we have an
advantage

895
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,460
the world is starting to realize after
Katrina and 9/11 other things

896
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,730
that in fact we're crisis we have
another advantage this is called a park

897
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,290
be leadership

898
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:41,090
the future is here now and it's about
bottom of multicultural decision-making

899
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:45,290
and I think that the highest collar for
any hacker history search and post the

900
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,970
true cost information about any product
or service

901
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,470
and my dream is to convert the
educational system

902
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:55,930
so that we do that now I've read Psalms
book I listen to home

903
00:55:55,930 --> 00:56:00,210
two years ago Microsoft the certainly
continuing big part of the problem we

904
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,230
have got to get to

905
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:06,360
open API's open source software open
source intelligence and open spectrum

906
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,440
and screw whether the government wants
to do or not that's what ham radio

907
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,940
operators did

908
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:14,310
they were the first hackers K

909
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:18,610
now this is my model this is what I use
to explain their really stupid generals

910
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:23,260
why open source intelligence matters on

911
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,700
you know the government they hear the a
clandestine human intelligence guys

912
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,260
which I used to be they tryin

913
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,270
recruit a player to drop the ball or
catcher on command

914
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:35,850
sick and plants a listening device in
the dugout tries to call the game that

915
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,700
way

916
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,130
imagery intelligence takes a picture of
the ball field every three days and

917
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,390
tries to predict the game that way

918
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:48,029
measurements and signals intelligence
sniff so the ball

919
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,690
and and and tries to predict its
direction and then when it fails asked

920
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,980
for $10 billion more

921
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:57,940
open source intelligence changes the
rules of the game

922
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,000
any catch by any member the crowd is an
out and we offer to buy the ball back at

923
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,950
low cost

924
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:07,230
that's how we handle the information
explosion

925
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:11,890
everybody gets to play everybody knows
that there is a benefit a tangible

926
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,339
benefit volunteer

927
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:17,510
Christie at Prestige whatever this is a
winning a poor order battle and it's the

928
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:20,780
only order battle that will scale

929
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,000
and adapt to me the divers

930
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,720
unpredictable challenges that we face so
open spectrum

931
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,880
open money open everything

932
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,440
I tried to get at McConnell admiral
studeman told him he should listen to me

933
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:40,360
I spent a long time preparing a one
pager

934
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:43,910
for the Deni with its essence said
launch a lifeboat

935
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,870
if you're not using open source
intelligence to judge the return on

936
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:48,540
investment in all the classified

937
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,870
disciplines you're screwed you didn't
get it

938
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:55,150
I'm you know he's a good man but he's
just ya know you don't now

939
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,250
and these people are on autopilot

940
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:03,440
arm so these are for reforms in need of
the open and you can look at this later

941
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,640
but basically open source information
has something to do with each of these

942
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,720
self-rule by non trance partisan
transparency is

943
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,150
our deal if I were running for president
I would be talking about

944
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:19,830
our deal and I would not be telling you
what our policy is I would be asking you

945
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:24,190
what our policy should be K neither
McCain or Obama

946
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,370
get that electoral reform right now is
the only big issue

947
00:58:28,370 --> 00:58:31,560
voting on weekends instant runoffs up

948
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,480
I I'm planning to listen to the
electoral thing because those machines

949
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,140
are totally hosed

950
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:39,879
okay RNN even if they were closed okay

951
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,310
for the Ohio republican secretary state
to put all the good machines in the rich

952
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:45,020
districts

953
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:48,070
and put all the shooting machines in the
black districts so the people have to

954
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,300
stand in line for seven hours this is my
teenager would say

955
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:54,760
clue that something's wrong okay

956
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,470
on it's terrible

957
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:04,550
you are all as hackers pushing the edge
of the envelope and I'm very proud to

958
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:08,430
have been one of the first people to
really understand that and and to speak

959
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:13,350
on that behalf in fact is a PBS a I just
found a PBS interview with me

960
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:17,950
are if you look up Robert Steele spy
hacker PBS you'll get it

961
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:21,500
I am she said was smart back in 1994 are

962
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,980
I mean really pushing the edge of the
envelope and in my view

963
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,220
we need to terminate this this kind of
we are our own little community and we

964
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,490
need to go out there and in fact
everybody else

965
00:59:33,490 --> 00:59:37,490
on so this is our first book

966
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:41,340
%uh collective intelligence creating a
prosperous planet if peace

967
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,840

free online

968
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:49,030

assessed at net

969
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:54,740
forward slash see i'd be now to the
right is something my son and I devised

970
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:58,920
in with a tip of the hat to jolt cola I
believe we can

971
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:02,530
dear to want it all we are one

972
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:06,050
and i'm not the person originated that
concept but I absolutely and oh by the

973
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,390
way I want to go back and say

974
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:11,120
on the public intelligence thing
whatever they had to Nadal Riley

975
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:15,880
open source in this is so cool I have to
use it open sources darwinism

976
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,470
while proprietary now we're in secrecy
are intelligent design that is not so

977
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,220
intelligent

978
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,910
I love that line nada riley is the
originator of that line

979
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:28,009
now I brought a hundred and twenty
copies of this latest book
