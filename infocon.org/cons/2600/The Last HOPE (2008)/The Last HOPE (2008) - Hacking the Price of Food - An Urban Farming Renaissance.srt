1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:05,770
know I know

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,180
at thank you for coming you know Jacob
Obama speaking in another room

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,700
I might have been there for was in here
so appreciate your being here

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,130
on a call me bicycle mark from some %uh
view

5
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,430
probably have never heard me briefly I

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,170
as you can hear American a Portuguese
American and I live in Amsterdam

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,140
but more importantly yes more
importantly I do a podcast

8
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,409
on under-reported news and global
concerns and I've been doing it since

9
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,749
2004

10
00:00:33,749 --> 00:00:37,829
and podcasting years that sold it's a
little bit like

11
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,100
animal years dog years or something and

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,659
I'm here today XP to: look there's a
coffin

13
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,748
I'm here today to see speak to you about
a

14
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:50,960
urban farming how did this happen well
first of all I

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,149
I do have a background in farming it's
in my heritage but I myself

16
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:59,679
manage a small garden in Amsterdam it I
do eat some of the stuff that comes out

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:00,100
of it

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:04,320
but the hacking the price for food an
urban farming Renaissance talk

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,990
I'm doing because a chosen different
topics in berlin a

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,449
spoke about the Arctic I choose a topic
and I sit on it for a number of months

21
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,420
I'm a journalist

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,520
or at least I call myself that and hope
that everybody believes me

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,920
and the urban farming scene was one that
I'd seen here and there is many of you

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,960
probably have

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,220
they're probably people sitting here who
as ice people say

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,280
somehow works on my urban farmer that's
not how it is in a

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,910
Portland and you probably do have unique
information

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:36,619
about your urban farm that's fine
perfect I invite you at the end of the

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,090
space

30
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,700
so you can say something about maybe
something you notice my talk or

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,680
something you want to add I am NOT an
urban farmer

32
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,100
but I'm a big fan and so a couple months
ago I started on the journey

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,380
love doing interviews which is what I do
for my podcast doing my research reading

34
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,399
my PDF's

35
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,540
and other types of documents learning
about how people are doing urban farming

36
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,010
in different parts of the world

37
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,540
and way started was I was we'll get to
the slides and stuff

38
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,810
second I was doing %uh podcaster to on

39
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,880
food security for more specifically

40
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,039
the problems we have in case you didn't
notice in the world these days

41
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,950
having a slight problem with food I
whether it be the price

42
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,290
access to it crops are damaged I mean
we'll go over all the problems in the

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,719
world

44
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,170
and I noticed this and I was trying to
interview people about this I was

45
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,189
interviewing people the UN about the
problems with feeding the hungry

46
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,629
and them and I thought to myself what
you know

47
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:33,099
its it's a bummer more than a bummer
that people in the world

48
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:37,170
are suffering because uva price some
food on the market and then

49
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,359
somehow eventually translates to
shortages in some places and an

50
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:41,849
extremely high prices and others

51
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:46,029
above their people I know I've seen in
Philly has spent some time in Philly in

52
00:02:46,029 --> 00:02:46,510
my life

53
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,388
and i've seen people doing farming and
raising their own food in cities

54
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:53,489
and I heard it here in New York to but I
still haven't gone from Herman

55
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:57,120
farm in New York and I know I want to
focus on this I wanna follow

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,810
how people do urban farming in not only
North America I tried to do all around

57
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,950
the world that was too much so

58
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,310
let's just talk in general that sure to
follow urban farms in Australia and in

59
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,239
israel and

60
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,069
well at six North America so off we go
packing the price of food

61
00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:15,290
at urban farming Renaissance in North
America

62
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,269
first of all I want to make sure I
define urban farm people always say to

63
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:20,730
me

64
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,150
what is that I have a garden I live in a
city in mind urban farmer

65
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,769
I mean to me if you want to be in urban
farmer you are

66
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,639
my focus here starts in your backyard
but it gets higher

67
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,169
it goes beyond what you do in your
backyard some people do and many

68
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:36,930
backyards

69
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,109
some people doing a large plot of land
and we'll get off into those different

70
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:40,629
types have

71
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,480
size urban farm so a star with them a
general

72
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,239
vague definition that lets everybody fit
in which is

73
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,779
growing food in an urban setting so if
you're going through your backyard

74
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:55,840
yes you're in urban farmer maybe you can
apply for a license to be in some club

75
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,249
or are you there you're you're in urban
farmer you just didn't know it I

76
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:02,620
of course there are people that are
doing it in a much more organized and

77
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,900
professional manner and those are the
people had been trying to focus on

78
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,169
so we have your backyard have you empty
lots you have your roof tops we are on

79
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:13,260
the top floor I'm not sure if you went
up to the roof already I heard you're

80
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,849
not allowed anymore so don't do that

81
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,150
but if you did you may fall off find
that some employees the hotel Penn

82
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,799
is running a small scale farm and with
which she feeds the entire building this

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,980
will be very interesting

84
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,270
I don't think he's doing that but you
could and there are people that are

85
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,719
trying to do this in different cities
all around the world

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,390
a balconies on another be something more
for Amsterdam or my backyard

87
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,419
and larger buildings a so I said already
small scale to large scale so

88
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,910
there's also urban farms the don't want
any money I've encountered quite a

89
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:45,120
number of those that say let me just
remind you

90
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,610
we're not trying to make money okay
that's fine but some urban firms to make

91
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,240
money they do sell their food

92
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,910
on a a market in your city maybe
whatever city you come from has a

93
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,180
farmers market

94
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,380
and that is where some urban farmers
might sell their food

95
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,980
so those are included in my research
like a scientist with research

96
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,710
doing research so let's go over the
state of global food

97
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,419
people have been having some trouble
with this and

98
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,000
wineries in some parts the world are
food shortages now

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,250
a some %uh viewer experts in wire their
food shortages I'll give you that quick

100
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,850
or the Kress rundown why sometimes we
have

101
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,400
extreme weather global warming their
floods their

102
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,580
a unusually extreme temperatures
including

103
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,960
may be here obviously we have floods in
the midwest in Europe we have extreme

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,229
heat every summer

105
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,790
a damages crops and that means less food
to go around

106
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,530
and well that is one of the many causes
I've a lot of food shortages and of

107
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,640
course

108
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,260
more mileage texting conditions prices
a.m.

109
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,940
some people can't afford with the price
of food the way it is we're getting as

110
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,480
high as it is in some places they can
afford to eat

111
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,840
the way they used to so that more

112
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,950
farmers and citizens protesting on if
you've noticed this

113
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,920
everywhere in the world I can barely
think of a place I don't know the

114
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,250
farmers in the midwest the US

115
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,080
protesting well the farmers in Spain are
there upset about fuel prices

116
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,390
and a the farmers in Argentina

117
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,640
are upset about hi export taxes they're
protesting that been protesting for

118
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,969
months and months

119
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,210
a not you know pick they're upset bid on
a farm until they fix things

120
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,260
am any each if you have a we'll get to
that moment

121
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,760
rights over food shortages shortages
grain

122
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,330
a you have as biofuels thing is probably
somebody here somewhere giving an

123
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,700
interesting talks on how you can power
your

124
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,660
bike with only know your car from a bike
with myself

125
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,880
at powering your car with different
kinds bio fuels that is a very big deal

126
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,490
in the United States and

127
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,230
well all over the world Andy this has an
effect on the price of food and then

128
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,630
there we go again with the problems with
how much is my food and i cant afford to

129
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,040
eat this anymore

130
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,460
Paso biofuels are in this big mix

131
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,380
I threw in a graph I'm not going to read
to you can look at it if you want to

132
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,260
look at me

133
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,380
the it's a little bit about the price of
grain a

134
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,590
oils probably at cooking oils and also
milk which have all as you can imagine

135
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,720
skyrocketed

136
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,740
I'm not gonna give you the statistics
you can look them up I'll provide a link

137
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,310
on my blog if you want but the the basic
fact is

138
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,610
since 2006 has been going on for about
two years I think it's made

139
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,410
major media in the last year has become
a big deal you've probably seen

140
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,830
article the one thing I noticed in my
research on urban farming

141
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,849
is in the last month to six months

142
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,030
everything is on big web sites like CNN
and BBC and it used to be only on

143
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,920
obscure da towards

144
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,370
where someone was reporting from there
urban farmer from their part in the

145
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,460
world now

146
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,830
up the the shortage of food the problem
with the food prices become a very

147
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,090
mainstream issue

148
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,590
that might be a good thing of course
then we have to question how the report

149
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,630
about it that's another

150
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,710
session altogether I

151
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,080
the biggest grain exporters in the world
have halted exports

152
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,229
kinda weird a I know that there's a lot
conditions on these

153
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,490
halting exports cuz xn a la the world's
grain comes from there they halted

154
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,630
exports I think that was an

155
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,050
April ukraine followed suit I don't know
how much of Ukraine's green we're

156
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,810
eating but in that part of the world in
Eastern Europe definitely it's an

157
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,920
important grain producer russia has also
placed

158
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,770
a lot of limits on grain exports
Argentina

159
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,550
India besides grain I think you can also
get into other

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,690
multi2 brains I was just in a

161
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,169
Asian as I was in a Southeast Asian I
was looking around for how much rice was

162
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,340
I am I'd couldn't barely understand what
was going on with my rice

163
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,469
abut Indonesia Vietnam Cambodia

164
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,410
I know egypt is in southeast asia they
have all place caps for restrictions on

165
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,300
their exporting in a place in a part of
the world where

166
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,790
respectfully rice exports are so
important this is a huge deal

167
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,880
and Egypt I mentioned Egypt in there
because um

168
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,110
well I want to make sure I pointed out
that there's been a whole lot of I

169
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,690
conflicts on the streets between you
know people who want bread and can't get

170
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,570
bread

171
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:08,570
and it's not the only country but that's
the 1i from

172
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,120
the list and the UN estimated in this is
already blown up since I

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,500
since I wrote it that this year they
would need five hundred million dollars

174
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I did in addition to the normal budget
just to avoid a famine in the world

175
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,160
you may or may not know that the UN is
responsible for feeding

176
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,020
a lot of the world starving populations
through food aid

177
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,569
and they estimated $500 million this was
like four months ago

178
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,680
so I think that it has gotten much worse
than they thought even though they're

179
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,310
already

180
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,770
planning for a bad year and it's gonna
cost a lot more

181
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:44,460
and there's no telling if they're gonna
get it they've announced that actually

182
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,200
they don't think they're going to be
able to handle the food

183
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,940
situation the world this year there will
be a lot more hungry

184
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,020
now that I pain it's such a sad sad
picture let's go to the exciting world

185
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,319
at urban farming up

186
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,890
I had a listening to music but there was
no music

187
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:07,000
that's an urban farming is next to
railroad somewhere in in Jersey

188
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,990
a better health okay I want to list so
many advantages years probably sitting

189
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,160
there thinking

190
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,270
a well who is this and then you're
thinking why would I want to curb in

191
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,870
farm

192
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,570
I mean what is the big deal why is it so
good for me some middle is the fun for

193
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,010
them

194
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:24,020
some other prolly all-news maybe some
our new news

195
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,939
first of all I'm better health now this
is I'm talking about and cities in 10

196
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,839
cities

197
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,029
in the city I was born in Newark its

198
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:35,439
dipping relive it's hard to get access
to good food

199
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,020
the you know we have if you like whole
food supermarkets were tree I love

200
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,930
Trader Joe's and I come back to the US
legal right to Trader Joe's

201
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,120
maybe like smaller little supermarkets
that have healthy food

202
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,770
but the fact is in the inner city it is
hard to get access

203
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,810
to good healthy food I'm talking about
fresh vegetables

204
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:57,010
fresh fruit yet to go to tiny little
bodega up sorry

205
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:00,290
but it is a bad word actually cuz it's
just that little tiny shack

206
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,660
and they sell whatever probably fast
faster

207
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,350
food convenience snacks and all that
sort of thing so in an urban farm

208
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,550
situation you have much healthier food
because you're growing it

209
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,260
and it's fresh in an urban setting food
security that's a big deal says Rick

210
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,210
government through security I'm not
talking about terrorism or blowing up

211
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:18,560
your

212
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,790
eggplants I'm although if the government
gets her hand on this that'll probably

213
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,219
be a big issue

214
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,480
and have additional security in urban
farms I

215
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,180
but for security in quality you know
securing access like I said to good food

216
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,730
um is a concern at this point we don't
know

217
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,230
how it's gonna go with the prices you
know the cost of fuel with the

218
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,589
extreme weather see i havent eisin if
we're gonna have access to

219
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:48,130
and secure access to good food serving
farming provides that we're ideally does

220
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:48,880
provide that

221
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,160
and it's in your neighborhood hopefully
employment it depends on the Urban Farm

222
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,100
summer all-volunteer

223
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,600
but some do have staff on some envision
since they're doing so well nowadays

224
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,000
but they will have staff so are in
farming could be a good source for job

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,200
maybe you're bored with your tech
computer job

226
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,560
and even thinking about quitting and
becoming a farmer but you're not sure if

227
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,570
you can go and live

228
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,720
in nebraska no offense to Nebraskans so
maybe

229
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,899
you could work on an urban farm in your
local neighborhood that's a job in

230
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,240
you see how that works as social life I
know there are people at this conference

231
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,130
that have social life issues

232
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,710
and an urban farm is a very social and
communal activity you go there you will

233
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,960
speak to other people perhaps

234
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,570
and they may speak back to you and you
might learn things about your community

235
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,750
in yourself

236
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,440
and that is a and using that as an
advantage up

237
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,520
I you have the environments were all
very concerned about it in our own

238
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,060
different ways in a different times in
our day

239
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,170
I an urban farm is very kind to the
environment I'll get more into why

240
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,649
but they're a very big into recycling
composting piece or two terms may be

241
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,470
you compost in your household urban
farms are definitely into composting

242
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,520
and it's more than that you know it's
the cost of transport to get you your

243
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,170
milk

244
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,460
I noticed I was driving on the a
whatever route 2001

245
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,930
in New Jersey and used to be a dairy not
too far from

246
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:16,270
my house my parents house just here like
20 min SWE there is gone now they get

247
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,390
the milk from even further away

248
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:21,620
because you can I guess because fuel was
cheap I

249
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,050
with fat you know when we talk about
emissions

250
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,430
especially world emissions the less
distance our food has to go

251
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:33,040
well that the less we have to you make
more missions more co2 and you see where

252
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,560
I'm going with this

253
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,600
at energy again that's directly
connected to the environment the amount

254
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,440
of energy

255
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,820
that is used to get your food an well
that is

256
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,200
reduced when you get it from your
neighborhood

257
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,410
all right let's go to some details have
0 there's a bad side

258
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,630
and some people mention this to me in
the world urban farming

259
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,970
they're very honest with me they said
well it's not you know the answer to

260
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,529
everything

261
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,390
so I felt it necessary to list some up
the problems that I see

262
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:02,939
with urban farming and urban farmers
have

263
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,190
I'm one is pollution I was just in
Bangkok

264
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,959
Bangkok has urban farms I'm really
worried

265
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,260
because their people raising fruits and
the

266
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,350
the trees are using oxygen and then
oxygen in bangkok is

267
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,180
terrible I am so I'm a little concerned
there's pollution pollution is

268
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,209
definitely an issue

269
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:25,910
not only in the air but also in the soil
that is where your food is being grown

270
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:28,899
obviously there are steps you can take
to improve the situation but it is

271
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:31,020
definitely the number one criticism

272
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,480
but when you talk about urban farms
people go I'm not too sure about the

273
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,180
neighborhood

274
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,899
her raising plans for the air quality at
the traffic in that

275
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:43,660
definitely an issue space in scale is
probably the largest issue

276
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,160
I you cannot beat in terms of amount of
people that can be fed

277
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,439
you can't beat a huge ass farm in

278
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,980
I O and I'm gonna take on Isla I you
can't beat the

279
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,560
size the farming is going on in Brazil
with an urban farm

280
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,209
in a where they doing in New York East
New York somewhere eastern half

281
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,600
on a boat there their farming on a boat
now on the Hudson River

282
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,500
I am there and so you can't be you can
compete with the size and scale

283
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,910
love larger farms is a concern for urban
farmers and small scale so it serves

284
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,469
a limited amount of people but I have
maybe an answer for that

285
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,770
and in this question capital a who's
gonna get the money

286
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:27,899
to start wannabes if you wanna settle a
set of

287
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,080
if you want to start an urban farm in a
certain neighborhood perhaps are used to

288
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,190
be a factory there

289
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,019
again my hometown of New York has up
plenty of room

290
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,990
abandoned factories we could definitely
have gone for those ages ago if we had

291
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,760
the money

292
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,390
and start in urban farms as a question
of where you gonna get the capital

293
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:47,580
and die yeah well that's an issue

294
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,010
property value always thought that in
the and and this was confirmed in some

295
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,519
my interviews in the nineties is a rough
time

296
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,190
in some instances for urban farming
because well the neighborhood was hot

297
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,850
it's hard try hard to afford a an urban
farm in Brooklyn

298
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,529
the any part of Brooklyn now but back in
the day I guess a.m.

299
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:07,700
some the train your part to Brooklyn you
know that they wanna build something

300
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:07,950
there

301
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,830
new condo and may be taken out price you
are you know that it's an issue in terms

302
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:13,660
of

303
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,529
property values specially was starting a
new urban farm in the middle of the city

304
00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:21,810
thankfully there's a real estate
collapse so this is our big chance to

305
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,990
plant things but still disadvantaged

306
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,209
as a let me give you some types are in
firms that i've seen you're probably

307
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:31,970
sitting in your seat thinking I know
another type

308
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,470
added to the list tomorrow I your
backyard

309
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,050
and I don't just list this to be a basic
but in fact

310
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,980
in my interviews with urban farmers
especially in Western Canada

311
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,390
they always reminded me that the most
important urban farm

312
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,069
is always the backyard and that if
everyone were planting their food the

313
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,980
backyard well that would make a helluva
difference in in where people get it

314
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,589
from so

315
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,100
we must acknowledge backyards are still
a very important part of urban farming

316
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,300
but let's get to the course that

317
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,449
I am CS A's Community Supported
Agriculture

318
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,850
I'm gonna further develop online how
this is in what this is but it

319
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,928
as it sounds that engages the community
in the urban farming process you have a

320
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:13,949
role

321
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,620
and there are different kinds rules at
all explain

322
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,290
spin farming sounds very exciting a
fictional our machines

323
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,659
and and spin farming is a type of urban
farming that I will

324
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,030
course explains and started in Winnipeg

325
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,840
I believe and it now is going on in
Philly in other places we'll get into

326
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,850
that

327
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,070
vertical farming is the most exciting
especially for tech conference

328
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,850
as so we will get into that as well
these are my type that I'm dealing with

329
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,820
today

330
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:46,510
i'm Jack a rat a.m.

331
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:49,820
backyards alright I said that Moose Jaw
yes

332
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,460
yes I know is this a.m. in terms if they
are there

333
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,620
urban farming organisations especially
in North America who actually gets

334
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,929
subsidies from city governments

335
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,570
in some cases to promote composting and
not only promote it but you have to

336
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,780
actually teach people how to compost

337
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,629
I myself have a lot of trouble my
compost doesn't seem to compost just

338
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,960
it's a giant mountain and I add to it
and I story and I water it

339
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,860
and animals enjoy it but it composting
is not easy and

340
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,480
in many cases you could use a good
community organization or

341
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,390
a tutor at to come over and explain how
to compost in many cases

342
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:28,820
urban farming organizations are other
composting on their property or

343
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,678
providing courses on how to do it and
this is definitely a big part of the old

344
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:37,559
old-fashioned style in your backyard or
in a buncha backyards urban farming

345
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,860
and that brings me model cycle urban
farming very cool

346
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,040
let's just imagine this exists that you
have a yard

347
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,799
and you're very busy person but there is
room for farming and you're interested

348
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,540
and maybe they're a bunch of people like
you in your town let's say you live in

349
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,190
Victorian British Columbia in Canada an

350
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,260
there are mobile site urban farmer
organisations

351
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,120
that will come to your house and a farm
your backyard

352
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,140
and then you're part of the whole
process you reap the benefits you will

353
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:05,770
get

354
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,110
sum up the and plants from this year

355
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,200
I am they use your yard for you than me
that slogan

356
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,049
might share that with them all right
here we go it's ESA

357
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:19,830
I think this is by far the most common
type of urban farm especially in in the

358
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,470
Northeast I've noticed

359
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:25,200
I it is a complete community supported
agriculture so you have

360
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,750
your shareholder very corporate am

361
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,380
you could be a a patron which you know
you give a certain amount of money every

362
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,070
year

363
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,250
and there are other types I called
regular you be a half share person we're

364
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,030
going to that

365
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:40,010
have share maybe you don't have a lot of
money nor do you want a lot of food

366
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,190
you're only one person you're skinny as
I am

367
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,330
and you maybe just pay for half a share
for now

368
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,379
and as part of paying for that have to
share you get

369
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,460
a certain amount of food every year this
is practiced in

370
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,390
in many cities all over the country in
fact not just the Northeast

371
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:59,910
working shares this pretty cool I would
do this

372
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:04,830
you can be part of an urban farm and
once a week go until the land

373
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,879
and yes you get to reap the benefits you
get a certain percentage of food

374
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,610
every month or whatever period you want

375
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,870
specialty shares may be really into the
goat cheese and your urban farm has

376
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,169
goats I you can pay specifically to be a

377
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:23,540
getting the goat cheese or the maybe the
milk if you're into milk

378
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,549
maybe not so that's different I to
community

379
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,290
a.m. supported urban farms that's been
farming

380
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,330
this is crazy I myself have trouble with
this but I did speak to the founder of

381
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,540
spin farming and he's he's very excited

382
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,500
he just started a new one in
Philadelphia I well as if I explain it

383
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,169
you know the farmers in the room will

384
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:46,010
will not in go hm a small plot intensive

385
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,840
I don't know what happened to the end
split and there's an end somewhere aspin

386
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,790
farming small-town intensive

387
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:56,020
I for small they're all about space and
time saving techniques you may have a

388
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,190
small piece of land

389
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,070
but they are working on strategies so
that you will get a whole lot from it

390
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,809
in a short time and you're wondering how
hashemi

391
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:08,980
I for civil use vertical space you know
it either

392
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,940
I think if shelving perhaps so you can
pull them up by a stranger you can use

393
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,049
trellises thats

394
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:16,650
using vertical space and you can save a
lot of room instead of having the

395
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:17,710
cucumbers

396
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:22,260
you know you've been there I am
successive planting

397
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,410
alright when one see how to farm when
one season is over so if one

398
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,950
plant is already given its a cycle urs
fruit

399
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,650
you immediately plant the next one that
will plan in the next a season so you

400
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,250
sort of

401
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,330
keep the land being used properly set
and letting it sit

402
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,750
and if you're confused by that will you
can have to follow the link

403
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:45,299
a in for planting is crazy slow and fast
maturing plants

404
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:50,610
so when one is more quickly giving fruit
well into planting

405
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,970
wide roll planting instead of in one
little straight line you could do wider

406
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,160
roseanne apparently

407
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,250
in their experience that's been farming
it yields a lot more in terms of fun

408
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,179
at fruit an hour bus ride is I know

409
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:07,340
I know now we don't like bush but

410
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,129
by at and apparently one of the great
ways that's been one big

411
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,850
a.m. at aspects it's been farming is
they should get

412
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,030
fruits and vegetables that grow in
bush's rather than long

413
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,120
vines and apparently they will do this
for you if you want their help

414
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,020
and so it's been farming is one of those
growing movements in urban farming

415
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,389
especially in North America

416
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,220
alright vertical farming is what you've
been waiting for his robots these

417
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,179
machines as lasers

418
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,429
look at that that that doesn't exist

419
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,610
I well it exists in someone's mind

420
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:45,150
has I hold on getting it on I i'm when

421
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:49,330
that's life I think if looks better
there I okay

422
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,549
let me try to explain I don't work for
vertical farming II

423
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,929
take it or leave it but is one of the
most innovative things I've heard of in

424
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:57,190
the world urban farming

425
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,020
the idea is that I instead of just
farming your little plot of land

426
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,668
we build entire buildings they could be
skyscrapers as grand as that

427
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:10,390
competing with the Citigroup building in
that sort of thing and

428
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,130
but they could also be less floors
obviously you should but the idea is

429
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,490
that in a large building

430
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:20,690
you farm in large-scale and you do it

431
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:24,510
my secretary will get that I you don't I
said that

432
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,990
haven't dude I

433
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:34,740
the ideas you do it without soil
hydroponics a lot of us are into it

434
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,620
yes yes

435
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,009
know about Hank that's right I am so
they're a very girly things in

436
00:23:40,009 --> 00:23:40,909
hydroponics what

437
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,580
I but the ideas they don't use oil and a
used the space

438
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,899
vertically that they have and look with
what we're on the eighteenth floor

439
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:51,230
we could do a whole lot of farming is
building in if it wasn't for lights and

440
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,690
some other

441
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:55,210
conditions but still and the ideas that
use the vertical space

442
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:59,480
to raise large scale I mean they're
talking about and by they I mean

443
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,990
researchers at columbia university
researchers in the Netherlands at Boston

444
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,909
University

445
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,909
and a couple other universities that I
don't know about I

446
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,929
vent their plan is that this could
compete with a

447
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,159
large-scale commercial farms not only
that they insist that it needs

448
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:16,249
to compete with large-scale urban farms
because the problems

449
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:19,730
that come with large-scale urban farming
maybe all

450
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,940
develop on that in a second one other
big advantage is a vertical farming

451
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,320
that they believe is better is that the
growing season is all year I

452
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,619
because it is the win if they do it in
the building in a controlled environment

453
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:35,639
let's say a let's say

454
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:38,879
let's say that dumb the

455
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:42,100
normally you would have a flight like in
the midwest and Noble the crop is

456
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,749
damaged

457
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:46,580
gonna be a bad year well if if in and
it's very difficult have a flood in a

458
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,658
large building although

459
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,190
but in the bathroom I but if that were
to happen

460
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,559
I'm you could just fix the problem you
don't stop the leak whatever the problem

461
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,110
was yes you've lost some crops

462
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,529
you can immediately get back to you
growing because the growing season is

463
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:05,619
always that's one other events it's more
efficient when it comes to water now

464
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:06,669
they do need water

465
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:09,970
but one of their insistence and also you
nice diagram where your you see you

466
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,289
believe in your view somebody a cherry
Ave so excited

467
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,389
I am that they recycle the water that
they use within the building they make

468
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,149
you so the

469
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,059
dirty water they make a extremely
efficient use of the Clean Water

470
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,149
they clean the water in recycling right
and

471
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:28,090
they make L good use of the space
obviously and in terms of energy

472
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:32,220
any designs well those two didn't really
have it today no nevermind

473
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,590
the designs that you'll see a fun urban
farm from

474
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,210
vertical farm building the plan is that
they'll have solar

475
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,629
a energy the facilities on top panels

476
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:46,289
or wind or as what one thing they'd like
to do

477
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:49,830
is grow plants that I am they can use
for um

478
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:55,418
at energy production so they'll use the
entire plan and their plan to some

479
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:57,470
someone will be used for bio-fuels and
also

480
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,850
biomass the word I was not getting we
fix my aunt presentation

481
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,369
caning fit great transitional year

482
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,480
hmm yep and so what are the advantages
we here now about what's going on in the

483
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,669
midwest what's gone on

484
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,090
in the Midwestern United States on
you're not at the risk

485
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:19,200
at risk for a flooding in a large
building you're not at risk above

486
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,960
drought especially because you lose use
far less water

487
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,330
many fewer where that for large scale
commercial farming

488
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,629
all whole lot of water is used and then
of course

489
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,600
never reuse it just goes away goes into
your ground water doesn't just go away

490
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,619
and it goes nice included of course the
pesticides

491
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:41,220
I high levels of metals and you know the
one all problems in new york city water

492
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,629
was

493
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:46,009
now farms in upstate New York that we're
using he knows all kinds it has the size

494
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,289
in the water once I got down here the
lovely mountain water was polluted

495
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,869
now I know someone fix that iceman my
podcast recently

496
00:26:52,869 --> 00:26:56,570
and but that is one of those concerns
that vertical farming

497
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:59,678
deals with so

498
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,580
some other downsides those nice
buildings that we saw

499
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,199
they don't exist now when I asked the
kind people

500
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,399
researching and working on urban
vertical farms there is still none

501
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,509
in functioning and that is a of course
big bomber

502
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:18,409
for those of us who want to see vertical
farms in action now apparently the

503
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:19,730
monies being allocated

504
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,639
a Chinese government is very interested
in urban farms as they have large cities

505
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:25,350
with a lot of people that need a lot of
food and

506
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,869
ends I don't have to start with me but
actually China the amount space even

507
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:31,580
actually farm in china is very small
compared to that

508
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,769
huge amount of country I am so still
unproven

509
00:27:35,769 --> 00:27:40,330
that is a bummer a.m. also and this is
just me actually know my interviewees

510
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,220
talked about this

511
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,749
I don't see how farm lobbies especially
in this country

512
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:48,210
but in other parts of the world as well
are gonna let this happen

513
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,769
I mean this would be a major shake-up in
how farming is done

514
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:55,230
when I asked them what do you do with
the old large-scale farms

515
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:58,369
in middle america we what you do with
these places were gonna do with the

516
00:27:58,369 --> 00:28:01,779
just nothing he said no we we return
them to being

517
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:05,419
a if you want carbon sinks or forest sir

518
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:09,859
space to do other things with hopefully
to let natural spaces be

519
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,590
and so this is also involved in their in
there plan

520
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:18,309
on look at the end I grams me that
interesting

521
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:21,649
as crazy you can out link to those on my

522
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:24,869
website an awesome links: perhaps that
we can share somehow

523
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm but yet I got this all planned out
but none is in existence

524
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,009
and of course major downside to the
vertical for movement

525
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:36,059
I when I asked about this pay is known
as an existence they said well look

526
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,619
it's happening now they're gonna be
built there's a plan this is the green

527
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,730
revolution now this is the time to build
them

528
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,570
so it's not in the world they have been
built they're going to be built

529
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:49,658
these an answer I guess but I was
disappointed because I want to go visit

530
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:53,349
I am I figured I'd show you a little
video for an urban farm don't let it run

531
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:54,039
all the way

532
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,990
just wanna miss you too will taste for
my good friends at Ryan is hungry

533
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:01,039
it's a regular urban farm in San
Francisco that I

534
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,789
that I like so let's watch a film ready
set

535
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:10,149
I'm Antonio time on alkali and write the
army chief I'm in San Francisco

536
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:13,320
it's a four and a half acre site and
we'd go through

537
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,928
yeah

538
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:16,890
yes

539
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,030
yes

540
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,800
down the farm is located basically right

541
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,700
in the middle of san Cisco it on the
southern side of the city I'm right next

542
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,290
to the

543
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,820
280 where lucky and have the space is so
large

544
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,580
that we have a big buffer zone between
that the freeway Emery go

545
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,139
this space was basically in a legal down
and people from all over the city would

546
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,030
drive down

547
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,160
how many Boulevard poor often dump their
refrigerators whatever it was they

548
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,660
didn't want and so people

549
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,890
and I'll mean housing community decided
they'd then what

550
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,990
had to have been their neighborhood and
so they worked with a group called the

551
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,950
san Cisco the Bourbon gardeners

552
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:57,530
to establish this site as as an urban
farm

553
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:01,050
the basic least created a fireman and
then slugged

554
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,790
unfortunately fell apart the site was
abandoned for about two years

555
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:09,030
it was in early 2005 that I started
coming here with a couple friends

556
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,570
it was the data reset organizing with
Palomino community to see what it was

557
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,210
that they

558
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,660
wanted to see how at this pace because
there was history that we don't wanna

559
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,370
ignore

560
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,830
this is their main Guardian I'm we've
basically grown are are growing area

561
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:28,500
by double every year that since we
started

562
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,420
so the first time his players only about
the first five rows that we actually

563
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,040
real

564
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,940
then we double bad now we've got the
whole I flat area over here in our

565
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,800
expanding over to the west Guardian

566
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,680
the fear is gets mainly distributed
among the volunteers they come on the

567
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,440
weekends

568
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,290
at four o'clock you know will will
harvest whatever is available on you

569
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,610
take on the grocery bagger produce for
free

570
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,170
some the youth workers they've been
taking food home mostly let the girls

571
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:56,810
the guys don't get all the girls will
take some home

572
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,770
some have families they bickered for
their families and then this year's

573
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,440
official we actually started selling

574
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,750
a pretty sad very very low rates at the
baby farmers market

575
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:11,230
this is still the main guy in a rapid
just beyond that is there a compost bins

576
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,220
that we have so

577
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,960
even though we import ally fertility be
still are trying to show the process and

578
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,560
how

579
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,070
food becomes fully once again eventually
be like to have chickens

580
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,580
possibly goats to showcase how animals
are an integral part of the production

581
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,480
to

582
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,640
even if you're a vegetarian you still

583
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,460
need fertility which often comes from
animals like anything's everyone E

584
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,620
and then add down here in their original
I'm individual

585
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:42,100
community garden plots I think that's
what they're in vision for an hour

586
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,430
firing them as well there is a very good
way

587
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,370
kinda show the community

588
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:51,190
like have a presence here that it's not
just an abandoned piece of land

589
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,540
so this is the the orchard area I'm we
have

590
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,790
I think about 70 something treaties

591
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,730
pears apples avocados no products

592
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,880
pomegranates person and supply arms like
five

593
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,180
and the problems is there pineapple
Rivaz

594
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:13,290
it's called Fe horse lol gonna that's
the

595
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:17,210
genus and species name are you get the
idea where the full film can be viewed

596
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,320
somewhere on the internet right is
hungry dot com

597
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,409
my good friends who follow and not only
urban farming but a

598
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,929
well we can call the green movement in
general all over the country

599
00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:29,970
and this is just one urban farm
interesting thing they point out is the

600
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:33,210
connection to the community I don't even
remember if somewhere in this

601
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:37,210
presentation I glossed over the fact
that in a lot of urban farms

602
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,410
they make it a priority to for example
take the food that they grow and bring

603
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:41,730
it

604
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,530
directly to I housing projects in areas
that they know

605
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:49,160
are gonna come and buy it necessarily
but would very much benefit and enjoy

606
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,080
having it and so for such a lot of urban
farms it is

607
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,800
one of their activities is bringing food
to communities and on the other hand as

608
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,550
you see here

609
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:00,250
communities come to you and farm there
in take-home whatever they can

610
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,880
a.m. all move forward from there
salvation

611
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,610
salvation lies within a so these is
certain questions

612
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,590
probably for me but maybe for urban
farmer somewhere will urban farming

613
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:18,059
save us I was sort of one of the
questions I asked in a better way

614
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,160
I you know if if urban farms continue to
grow as they

615
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,610
really are right now in a sort of
renaissance because people are turning

616
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,280
to them

617
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,620
thinking well one michaels getting way
too expensive and may be over here the

618
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,110
food is

619
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,410
competitively priced but be on that a
lot of people are more concerned about

620
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,850
where their food comes from

621
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,030
for good reason we've had plenty of
evidence the last few years

622
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:41,120
it says we don't always know what's
going on with our food we should

623
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,590
I so that I we always ask the question
what if we all have vertical farms are

624
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,370
to be cool

625
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,890
or if we all have I community supported
agriculture in our cities

626
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:54,370
then maybe we will need the big farms
anymore in a logical stopped me and said

627
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,700
in case I forgot at No we still need big
farms

628
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,929
a urban farms can provide you with
everything you need

629
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:05,010
among them wheat kinda problem in urban
farms in a lot of space

630
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,719
although in New England right now we'd
there they've they're using more land

631
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,270
for wheat production than they ever have

632
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,159
in a in a decade but well it's
interesting and see can't replace mass

633
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,260
scale farming it will always be there
but

634
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,629
you could definitely get more from urban
farms than we are right now

635
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:24,620
I will catch on so my big concerns with
everything

636
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,969
in this country will the responsible the

637
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:31,280
what is environmentally sound will catch
on all the kids wanna do it

638
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,429
and now we don't know I mean obviously

639
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,240
the education is a big deal I don't
remember

640
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,090
in science class in Union High School in
New Jersey if anybody said to me

641
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,060
you know that urban farms or even talk
to me about my guard in my backyard my

642
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,570
parents talking about that

643
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,730
so maybe that's where you can get some
is education and in the press

644
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,350
you know how much breast is urban
farming get it might be the

645
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,109
novelty story on CNN where they focus on
some crazy hippies

646
00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:02,390
a yes the crazy happy story for today

647
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:06,569
him after the jet skiing squirrel and

648
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:11,640
is or is it the future is also my big
question I mean when I look at vertical

649
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,440
farming I wonder is that the future

650
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,450
I it seems to me that there is
definitely a more of a future in it than

651
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,470
ever before

652
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,370
I we don't know what's going to happen
with fuel prices but we know that in the

653
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,120
short term

654
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,950
it's gonna continue their gonna continue
to go up and

655
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,359
can you imagine at some point getting
one of these exotic like mango and

656
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:33,660
avocado these firms that normally come
from far away

657
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,879
we may not be able to anymore early may
be such an exotic

658
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,359
item and I we have to try to look
elsewhere and maybe we need to look

659
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,710
in a row neighborhoods address avocados
fancy

660
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,010
anyway I it one thing it is

661
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:50,540
if you're concerned about sustainability
at urban farms hard to argue that

662
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:51,740
they're not sustainable

663
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,100
you can try but for the most part

664
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,210
part urban farming is being sustainable
and sustainability is a

665
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:01,490
is a core values so that is a a a good
thing

666
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,910
so there's some salvation their some
nice

667
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,180
yeah scale that it continues to be a
problem when I showed you fertile

668
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:09,750
farming

669
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,080
I believe that is a big answer for scale
but unproven

670
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,770
so there's still a question over how
much can we get out of urban farms how

671
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,009
much more urban farming can we do

672
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,250
I was in philadelphia yesterday and I
saw some spaces where we could be

673
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,310
growing food

674
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,660
so there's definitely more room and
there's definitely a lot of growing

675
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,210
interest and need

676
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:33,090
so we could if we get more from urban
farms than we do now

677
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:38,240
am I thought to myself well as I'm
winding down in the stalkers I am

678
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,230
and I provide some resources so I'll
share with you

679
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:45,550
my favorite resources for information
about urban farming for press

680
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,580
I mean really better than the mainstream
course we have blocks

681
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,930
and it's one of the beautiful things
about urban farming if you log onto

682
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,379
different to

683
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,930
message boards if you're really into it
like I am I you can see communities

684
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,690
sharing information

685
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,690
sharing strategies experiences what's
going on with their urban farm in

686
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,010
course it's all via these things called
the internets the tubes

687
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,890
a so City former .org city for murder
info which actually began in a

688
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,690
in Vancouver and is like I've been going
since 1978 and they're doing really

689
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:20,020
so much a in terms of information at
urban farming all over the world

690
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:24,410
they're my favorite source so I thought
I'd share that with you and are you AF

691
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,460
resource centers on urban agriculture
and farming that's for the nerds out

692
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,740
here that really want

693
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,350
the details I like that one a lot you
may have one in mind

694
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,770
you can email to me I and I collective
reached at work

695
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,840
which is a built-in border at no a blog

696
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,650
where people post info about people
doing urban farming around the world

697
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,000
and hopefully this inspires people this
gives in background in the info they

698
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,620
need to work go out and

699
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,819
farm your own eggplant and look there's
a picture

700
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,600
it's the this is floating in the Hudson
River as far as I know I haven't seen it

701
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,500
is still there but alright and I what I
do now

702
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,390
at a convenient time love almost forty
minutes past I leave it open for

703
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,759
questions

704
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:11,160
and the yeah you can asking basically
whatever you want but remember

705
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:14,370
I'm not an urban farmer right alright

706
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:21,370
a star treasure yes

707
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,700
a skylight in a bathroom what are you
trying to grow yeah I mean

708
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:36,700
on the surface sure but

709
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,680
that was an interesting environment
keeping myself

710
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,450
alright and set up our azinger the DVD

711
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:51,170
DVD I have to go to my may be lined up
at the microphone I

712
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,730
you have to organize ourselves as an
urban farming

713
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,710
its organize ourselves always in our
King

714
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:02,170
and it's working now so record the

715
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,599
vertical farming in the indoor stuff
deserve a concern about

716
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,109
do you need insects the pony mean you
need to have access to that reforms

717
00:39:10,109 --> 00:39:14,759
um they seem to think this is not a
concern certain terms of insects to

718
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,230
pollinate they believe in sex will still
come because in their designs lot of

719
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,290
different designs for the buildings that
don't exist

720
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,000
I and its open so

721
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,560
and then go back to 12 photos but it's
not like a a close building in terms of

722
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,290
Windows from what I understand and
design

723
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,509
so essentially be at birds

724
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:37,710
be it insects more most importantly can
still getting

725
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,880
and would still getting they seem very
confident of course

726
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,200
about that aspect up you say

727
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,609
pests no you didn't because I brought a
pest a couple times

728
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:51,190
and I said you claim you know to be free
of disease but

729
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,050
you could be wiped out by locusts and he
said well for what up I locus we can get

730
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,359
started again really quick

731
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:00,910
yet

732
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,720
yeah I mean provided that they're still
bees they

733
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,900
in the design you could still they could
still getting it and they would find it

734
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,960
but again that's only theoretical

735
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,089
any research on or

736
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:18,560
urban farming have you seen a
compartment was Asian

737
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,589
have any these processes up for instance
if I wanted to get started in

738
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:27,259
all I've got is a balcony available to
me I probably can't compost as well as

739
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,150
have a garden

740
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,710
years but not that space so if you seen
a.m.

741
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,980
you know anybody that started to do just
one part of it for instance

742
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,829
further we got space for garden is there
somebody that's

743
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:43,609
el cid maybe has a whole Potter land but
doesn't wanna do gardening so the only

744
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:44,790
do composting

745
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,250
and so there would be a %uh sorta
community effort

746
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:52,680
developing around the urban farming why
I have known as the some places

747
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,730
chooses or specialty a so

748
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,250
II mentions why didn't but again BC

749
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,650
in British Columbia the guy was very the
guy runs on

750
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,630
the city farming program there said that
composting was one in there mainstays in

751
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,740
fact was because

752
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,589
the Department of Sanitation was funding
them partially to reduce waste

753
00:41:12,589 --> 00:41:16,549
I want to save money on way so they want
people to compost I said I was there big

754
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:19,920
focus I am I mean

755
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,000
but beyond that I I guess it depends on
what people can do I'm sure a lot of us

756
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
either raise tomatoes on our windowsill
maybe

757
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,609
or compost on our balconies I mean
there's a there's urban composting

758
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:35,130
I know a lot about finals things about
that I am

759
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,680
a car car compartmentalizing

760
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,859
yeah I mean people do what they can
where they are right I mean I don't have

761
00:41:42,859 --> 00:41:43,839
a good answer

762
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,910
I think for what your okay know it's a
rare I mean is definitely

763
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,009
urban farms that have specializations
and sometimes it's because where they

764
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,520
are

765
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,140
or where their at the people who work
for them what their specialties are

766
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,540
from as a the case I just presented
where the money comes from

767
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,259
great and I there

768
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,800
I'm safety tips and a question the one
is on urban gardeners can

769
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,490
you can compost on your sink with red
worms and its whole area still a quarter

770
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,589
pounder forms from a farm have to come
to work and that happened over to your

771
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:14,390
desk is awesome

772
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,920
so the second thing is I'm are you can
also do I'm small scale vertical farming

773
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:22,680
with um chicken wire line it was some
gardens a garden paper

774
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,069
company PVC pipe in the middle with sand
and holes drilled in it so their

775
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:28,109
estimates oil and then you can put
plants

776
00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:31,589
all around the cylinder but just how
clever and

777
00:42:31,589 --> 00:42:35,069
my question is do you know much about
the intervale in burlington vermont

778
00:42:35,069 --> 00:42:38,390
no thank you it

779
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,379
and is what a great pass on a great
things in that when I didn't know what I

780
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:42,099
was on

781
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:46,390
gonna get myself into when I decided on
urban farming everywhere I go now this

782
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,700
morning I dropped off a friend

783
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,130
at a friends house and a friend said I
guess about urban farming

784
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,839
have ever heard it's also a farm in
Boston as well I heard about urban farms

785
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:56,400
in Boston but I don't talk to anybody
there

786
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,630
so on it perhaps it's a great thing
about urban farming

787
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:02,910
it's a much bigger world than we realize
and i realize obviously

788
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:08,879
a so yeah now no yeah so you mentioned
about the

789
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,839
how distribution these days is
relatively far as in for conventional

790
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:13,880
farms

791
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:18,020
and if urban farming were to become lot
more widespread

792
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,190
it are there is there much movement to
sort of cut out the middleman in

793
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:23,990
distribution and

794
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:27,599
use the internet to localized connect
people directly

795
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,740
and and you know you could order some
fresh

796
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,260
vegetables from around the corner by the
internet or something like that

797
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,319
so you cut out the actual a stand

798
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:41,359
well yeah but also our tix but but is
there

799
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,020
is there any really uses the internet as
as a connecting tool between

800
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,509
the the farmers and the consumers yeah

801
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,099
I her I don't make any sweeping
generalizations but I had a big problem

802
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:53,890
getting

803
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:57,210
I'm just simple answers via email from
urban farmers

804
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:01,690
sometimes they even called them they a
didn't have time or interest in

805
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:04,819
sitting are talking to me for too long
and so there

806
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:08,859
well i'm saying is a lot of urban farms
and I i'm sure New York is the exception

807
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:13,720
a not very into the technology a there's
sometimes a disconnect they're not all

808
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
the time

809
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,160
um cutting out the middleman is
certainly not a priority

810
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,490
there's a lot of talk about using on the
farmers market in town if there's no

811
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:23,650
farmers market

812
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,990
a lot of urban farms have deals if
they're if they're doing commercial

813
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,569
stuff

814
00:44:27,569 --> 00:44:31,810
have deals with a supermarket in town
and is normally not a big chain

815
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,369
supermarket but is probably

816
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:37,940
a larger independent if there are any
left that's if the city has one

817
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:42,450
they make specific deals with urban farm
so there doesn't seem to be and I don't

818
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,470
encounter and you could do your own
research

819
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:48,819
web sites that sale we are to so-and-so
urban farm click here to order food

820
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:52,319
I you can certainly click here to become
a a

821
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,200
shareholder share you know get a share
become a partner

822
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:59,710
I find out the price I did notice that

823
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,710
the price of fennel for her

824
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,640
is listed on web sites but as far as
ordering hide in the encounter that so

825
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:06,980
much

826
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:11,339
and maybe that's assertive the next step
which is connecting people who know

827
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:15,859
how to make things happen using we are
you know internet commerce or ordering

828
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:19,359
online but the right now it seems like
they're pretty busy farming

829
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:22,578
and getting things to market the old
fashion way

830
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,700
so far thanks

831
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,109
I though when you're talking over to go
for me he didn't mention anything about

832
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:32,810
livestock so I assume that's just
something that we're always going to

833
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,509
need a standard form for

834
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:37,810
right the question really a question I
tell you what I did I skipped it

835
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:41,109
when i said im interview I I guess I got
caught up in the moment

836
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:44,619
they mention when I remember the tall
building the vertical farms

837
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:48,770
the wanna main guys at Dixon professor
Dixon this for me it

838
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,160
a columbia he said to me fish

839
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,319
and livestock in the long run they
envision

840
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,310
vertical farms as being a place where
you can raise 'em now he insists

841
00:45:58,310 --> 00:45:59,589
everything is of course

842
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:03,240
a organic and so I can only

843
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:07,490
assume that animals be treated as
thickly and fish would be happy

844
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,790
up they get a good view

845
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:14,480
I have but some so they talk about it

846
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,520
and they talk about it as one of the
objectives yes crops

847
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,130
you know and and bio-fuels and food
crops but also

848
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,430
livestock and fish I honestly i nie

849
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:29,669
IIT to see it a because I'm more into
the food aspect

850
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,869
I'm not sure about livestock but one up
when the reasons they say this

851
00:46:33,869 --> 00:46:37,400
among the the size that they think they
can do it is because livestock

852
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,520
I I said that commercial farms are very
destructive

853
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,299
and they are going to take a toll on the
environment obviously for a purpose

854
00:46:44,299 --> 00:46:47,329
I am score so as livestock and an

855
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:51,240
you know something like thirty percent
of the world is the land mass is used

856
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:51,920
for farming

857
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,829
and livestock I so they hope that they
can

858
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:59,310
answer that problem by using vertical
farms as also places for fish in

859
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:00,740
livestock

860
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:04,970
thanks yeah just add to question some

861
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:09,000
the first is I'm in your travels in your
talks with urban farmers was there any

862
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:09,750
mention

863
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:14,510
love issues with genetic modification
fruits and vegetables to

864
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:19,089
not repopulate I E the season your
tomatoes won't grow tomatoes

865
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:24,410
and right commercial farming industries
intentionally doing this so that

866
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:27,920
we can grow our own tomatoes with the
seeds we have to purchase seeds from

867
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,700
them and

868
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:31,279
you know kind of like a trade was
already mentioned that are any issues

869
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:32,869
with that

870
00:47:32,869 --> 00:47:37,049
there the the people developing and
researching and working towards vertical

871
00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:38,020
farms

872
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:41,140
I of course can better speak for
themselves yeah but

873
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,640
I they always mention the beginning like
I said

874
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,170
it's gonna be organic they align
themselves with the movement

875
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:52,410
all feel people who are Ste not
skeptical but don't feel that they need

876
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,230
I am a genetically modified food and
don't want it

877
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,260
so so far that's where they're at they
get a lot of course their interest like

878
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,040
I mention government China

879
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,119
in the Netherlands universities
academics I'm wondering

880
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,890
if if Monsanto or name your corporation

881
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,339
a.m. Cargill comes forward and says

882
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:15,920
will fund you but there's a few
stipulations of course that's where we

883
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,349
need them to say

884
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:21,049
well we're not gonna do that if thats
the way they want to go with his buddy

885
00:48:21,049 --> 00:48:25,259
it does seem wide open for if someone
wants to

886
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,770
influence they could so it's not
impossible I am

887
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:32,250
yeah but at the same time with the
situation I've conversion a farming as

888
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:33,279
it is

889
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,240
I Gamo food genetically modified food is
already

890
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,599
it's just continually growing in gaining
in Roseburg

891
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:45,049
it in having rose before so but yet the
risk is still there

892
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:48,920
i know i cant get a normal size
strawberry yeah if I don't know why I

893
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,470
was too small I'm hungry

894
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,580
yeah but on the second question was on

895
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:58,049
whether any resources available to you
up and upstart urban farmers

896
00:48:58,049 --> 00:49:01,349
army in the hydroponic touring any good
reading or anything that was mentioned

897
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:03,180
to try to bring some

898
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,669
5 a small backyard I could probably
bring some of that

899
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,940
vertical growth endorse you know freshen
up the air in the house and

900
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,319
actually just bring the form into my
house there was not a and

901
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:18,509
of course thanks the internet we can get
this information but I

902
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,000
the average urban farm that exists that
is in production is not dealing in

903
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,270
hydroponics

904
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,250
it's outdoors about healthy it's about
being outdoor now they could exist

905
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,480
but I haven't spoken to anyone it's more
the idea just

906
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,480
just bringing your tomato plants inside
and yeah

907
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,410
either a gentleman there's talk about
trying to take I'm going to be your

908
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:40,990
microphone

909
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:45,270
and try potatoes because

910
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:48,069
as they gonna start in the dark as you
can tell he's in the drawer there was

911
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:48,810
growing

912
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:54,730
you I could

913
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,950
now yeah

914
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,970
but but the gonna have to talk to for
that

915
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,029
yeah issue with the seed potatoes as I
know there were

916
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:09,049
their studies where the database grows
in within like

917
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:13,299
I'll get off a second sorry it basically
without light it a growing rapidly

918
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:16,779
but it will die of without in the
absence of life

919
00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:20,170
from I got four minutes says the sign go
go go

920
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:23,210
I came with dimension to it soil %ah

921
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,690
being dangerously contaminated soil he
said you might have someone who can help

922
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,349
fix that

923
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:30,700
with things you have to detected the
soil how to detect them

924
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,079
how do you fix them I don't think so
I'll I am

925
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,430
what I was talking about was always
agree it's a great conversation I

926
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:42,078
is basically a decade ago maybe a little
more at this point cuz I forget how time

927
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:42,869
flies

928
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:46,609
a new york city water system was a huge
risk they were gonna need to build

929
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:47,339
additional

930
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,369
treatment plants or do something because
up

931
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:53,270
arms we call that runoff water from
farms in upstate New York was for

932
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,540
pesticides and

933
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,770
was a problem so there was someone who
went to the farms

934
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:01,759
and convince a lot of farmers change the
way they handle be a pesticide use or

935
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,470
runoff

936
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,779
any effectively saved the new york city
water system a whole lotta money also

937
00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:07,000
replace all the toilets

938
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,310
November remembers that he encouraged
lamberth replaced with

939
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:14,799
anyway soil detection wise they're
definitely resources for it

940
00:51:14,799 --> 00:51:18,020
they're definitely that's one of the
steps new urban farms to take

941
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,270
I but I'm I'm not involved so I don't
have a good answer on that on that front

942
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,920
but that's what I was talking about

943
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,760
that I know someone okay I would prolly
got two minutes at this point

944
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,839
a big only brief amor actually a plant
geneticist and I do spend my time

945
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,310
work and I'm so sorry for my talks
Hassan and thus

946
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:39,890
in a small plot farmer so I mean I do
annuals perennials and

947
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,950
in upstate New York and I just wanted to
to the

948
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,930
give people and ideas if there's a fun
movie you can watch for the real dirt on

949
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:50,279
farmer John which give you some ideas
about CSA's in its kinda fun

950
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:53,549
it's interesting and if obviously
there's love interest in this kinda

951
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:57,730
stuff and I will be around if anyone
wants this in more detail questions

952
00:51:57,730 --> 00:52:01,020
the real dirt on farmer John name the
film available on the internet for free

953
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,089
rent

954
00:52:02,089 --> 00:52:06,170
%um like everyone does we know we know
what we're doing

955
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:09,410
I'll ask question in om you

956
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:13,390
you were talking about vertical farming
and use it those

957
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:16,609
the structure would be open space like
that and

958
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:20,480
in North America you can only use it for
half a year

959
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,549
and if it's close to you quick you sick
the whole year supposed like the

960
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:26,950
greenhouse on the boat

961
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:31,540
the me disclosed greenhouse on the boat

962
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,670
right yeah understood

963
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,660
up apparently in their plans for how
it's going to work

964
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,790
yeah how many times I said that I there
as they have a certain degree of

965
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,470
temperature control

966
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:47,630
kinda I don't know exactly how that is

967
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,569
I can't tell you who to talk to about it
and perhaps that's a good follow-up for

968
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:52,210
me

969
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,560
that to get the nitty-gritty details on
how it's going to work I what I want to

970
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,049
do by showing you a little bit about
vertical farming

971
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,670
is just give you an idea of another
styled what is an urban farm that's out

972
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:02,279
there

973
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:05,869
II I shouldn't even be answering
questions about what

974
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:09,490
be on what I heard I did not ask about
that issue

975
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,810
so I i don't have any information about
it but it's a good point

976
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:16,049
and it's yet another question you know
that when it comes to

977
00:53:16,049 --> 00:53:19,099
can this be done and the fact that it
doesn't exist yet

978
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,500
the leaves a lot of question marks
lookin

979
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,079
think you're sorry about that or love
unanswered questions see a marked

980
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:31,890
I I thought I would just mentioned not
that that there's my website and I do

981
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:35,430
podcasts on all sorts of topics around
the world that affects human lives

982
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,079
and thank you very much for attending
this talk and see around
