YouTube videos its way

16
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,809

down for any reason but we sort of focus

17
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:01,360

on the ones are taken down for copyright
complaint on as you can see here

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,890

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,880
part this talk

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,270
I'm Dean Jensen I'm also part of every
culture movement

27
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,530
and have been involved with free culture
at Harvard and MIT for a while now

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,619
um so we're gonna start with kind of the

29
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:39,979
history have love the project why we put
together you to him

30
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,660
um what we wanted people to get out of
it what we wanted to get out of it

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:47,140
and then we're gonna like when talk a
little bit about the back and he's one

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,470
of the program is behind it

33
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,170
arm and oliver has been doing a lot of
really interesting research on some

34
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,640
other data that we've come up with

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,130
um so this

36
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,170
this post came upon ok the Google Blog
are

37
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,909
last october and a friend sent it to me
and as soon as I sighed

38
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,470
um some alarm bells went off basically
they're saying that

39
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,699
YouTube and Google are going to be using
and

40
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,130
a and it kind of an algorithm full

41
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,970
love a like video like video media

42
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,090
excuse me a bunch Lake

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,299
they've yes so they're gonna be
filtering videos automatically

44
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:29,750
based on a thumb printing system love um
a database the things the copyright

45
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,010
holders have given to them

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,429
if you too YouTube videos have matches

47
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,459
then the copyright holders will be
notified and the

48
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,910
because I pulled out here video
identification goes above and beyond our

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,190
legal responsibilities

50
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,829
it will help copyright holders identify
their workers on YouTube that sort of

51
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,090
set off the alarm bells in my head
because really

52
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,760
Google's using machines to decide what
is and isn't fair use

53
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,130
um and for anyone who's not know if
areas that's

54
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,760
that's a part of the copyright law that
allows us to actually use a copyrighted

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,170
work without the permission of the
copyright holder

56
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,739
and we can use it for purse in specific
instances where we're criticizing things

57
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:07,380
or

58
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,170
you making commentary on something and
so as soon as I found this out I was

59
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:11,510
like

60
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,299
what the crap like this is this is not
cool at all um

61
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,680
and so um this

62
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,000
this legislators sort of why I think I
was validated in

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,300
in being a little bit nervous arm some
%uh view may recognized

64
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,629
the the clouds here they're used in the
anonymous arm

65
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:33,890
message to Scientology video um the
original video was actually just

66
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,129
time-lapse video that some some guy shot
in his backyard

67
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,579
and put into the public domain he posted
on both DeMeo

68
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,060
which is where you can see above its a
video site and you also posted it to

69
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,030
YouTube Google Video

70
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,319
and interestingly enough

71
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,819
on the the science the anonymous

72
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:55,239
faction used that that footage in their
message society

73
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,700
scientology and then later on other

74
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,260
the Huffington Post on their was at
three 23-6 comedy website

75
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,690
arianna huffington those folks used some
this footage

76
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,810
in a spoof love the message scientology
video

77
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,080
and then Google actually sent arm

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,478
brown how the original creator a
takedown notice saying hey we've taken

79
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,510
your stuff of love

80
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,930
Google Video because it uses %uh some
copyrighted material from

81
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,690
this this thing having to put up so
basically they're automatic scanner had

82
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,740
put this thing out

83
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,250
said take this down and then I think
covering 10

84
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,270
they've allowed it but still this person
was really upset

85
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,349
because the the autumn the automated
system is just taking his stuff down and

86
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:42,409
assume that it was a derivative work

87
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:45,469
something that was actually devoted
forgive his so that's just that kinda

88
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,430
inherent problem

89
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,770
um so I immediately thought of the

90
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,650
Google chilling effects project which is
arm up

91
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,700
its it started out as an independent
project where they would

92
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,659
the the FF and some other people were
watching

93
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,229
a search results that were taken out of
the Google's system

94
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,669
due to copyright or other reasons I
think obscenity is one of them

95
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:10,849
um and then they highlight what's been
taken out now they're cooperating with

96
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:11,610
Google but

97
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,300
it's sort of a similar project so in
realizing all this

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,409
I tossed up the passing of arm and

99
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:22,800
then here

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,690
yes so dinner at the bat signal and here
this is where the bat cave

101
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,979
is the undisclosed location its Harvard
apparently

102
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,180
armored teams have the men are both
members of Harvard College recall chair

103
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,700
which is

104
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,760
um an organization that focuses on
basically the intersection between

105
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,349
um the digital world and are and the
copyright and all that good stuff

106
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:46,240
um for basically the free software
movement for everything that is a

107
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,279
software

108
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,700
um and so he brought it to our attention
this at the beginning of the school year

109
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,089
so we were like yeah it's a really
interesting project

110
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:56,550
we have a ton of other interesting
projects arm

111
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,279
and then we basically just sat on our
asses for a while and didn't do anything

112
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,029
which sucks until on the the war came
home so to speak

113
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:08,860
on this is our friend Kevin Driscoll in
a very tripped out picture

114
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,899
um he's a teacher a DJ and awesome dude

115
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:15,419
and he was totally silenced by this
really unfortunate

116
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:18,609
I automatic takedown thing so kevin's
and lifelong

117
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,190
native of Boston and therefore a big Red
Sox fan I'm sorry that's a question here

118
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,740
army and I this

119
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,130
video which was taken on his Motorola
RAZR

120
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,169
and it's only 15 seconds long arm

121
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,380
I love the last pitch ok the world
series last year

122
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,099
as you can see the quality is absolute
shit and all it's about seven seconds of

123
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,250
the video followed by eight seconds of
shaking because him and all his friends

124
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,940
are jumping up and down

125
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,010
but within three days is the video going
up I he solve this

126
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,899
this video is no longer available due to
a copyright claim by MLB advanced media

127
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,270
because apparently they were afraid that
people are gonna watch this city seven

128
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,440
second clip

129
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,080
from a cell phone instead of watching
their actual DVD or whatever it is that

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,200
they were selling

131
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,430
so Kevin Ford this a thanks in it to us
and hard because you're at a whole was

132
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,779
like

133
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:13,649
of hell naw you did not just go there

134
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:17,360
up so we reconvene in the back cave and
were like alright

135
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,789
we have to do something let's let's
build this tracker we're gonna we can

136
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,760
talk all YouTube videos if you wanna go
down

137
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,089
and oshit none of us can program

138
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:30,310
Oaks I yeah so

139
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,750
on that's when I decided to take a
pilgrimage down

140
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,289
dumb ass out about a mile on down to the
friendly tech Institute down the street

141
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,419
which had recently started their own
free culture chapter and we're

142
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,940
in very close cohorts with us now is
basically like guys we have this awesome

143
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,849
project

144
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,880
we can't code cuz we suck can you guys
if

145
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,700
code and they're like yeah that sounds
really awesome let's let's make a

146
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,820
project and so we started throwing out
ideas

147
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,310
and before the end of the day we had
come up with I

148
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,200
like a reasonable plan and and the
project due to my sport

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,589
and so these are some other folks that
we're working on onset project

150
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:10,849
om and so really we just waited for
about I've

151
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,240
maybe two weeks or something like that
and I am

152
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,709
quentin's gonna be talking about the
back and this is sort of just a crappy

153
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:17,560
photo but

154
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,610
all the sudden we had a working back and
there was a scanner there is a

155
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,800
a database the videos that we are
watching and so we're all really psyched

156
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,729
about that

157
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:30,349
um you Tim doesn't actually scan all the
videos on YouTube

158
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:33,659
I'm we're not that herculean right now
um so

159
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,620
we don't have a representative data set
so we felt like we weren't just

160
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,599
we didn't want this just to be a
research project we wanted it to be more

161
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:42,180
we wanted to be also

162
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,390
um a former activism in a form of
reaching out to people and saying

163
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:49,189
hate you know when you click the video
and i says this video is no longer

164
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,089
available

165
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:53,610
why is that and we wanted people to sort
of see get a little

166
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,870
more information on about the video so
we've put together

167
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,100
arm kinda colorful front and that

168
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,870
we thought was a good representation of
how things are getting taken down and

169
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,709
that there's there's lotsa we sort
amazing design choices

170
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:11,380
that we thought made the project more
accessible to more people so we could

171
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,660
have put up more data but we chose to
you

172
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,829
make it sort of simple and keep it kinda
arm

173
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:20,790
around not not brief but make it very
digestible and puts or to the mission

174
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,990
and a very focused way on the front page

175
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,209
um and I just wonder

176
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:30,899
kinda Lake like push on that for a
second because i think thats that

177
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,170
something is important

178
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,009
like having ugg have school there are so
many projects that are so awesome out

179
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:37,550
there

180
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,550
probably much cooler than what we're
doing but because a

181
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,180
the simplicity in the way that we sort
of pitch this to people we were able to

182
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,600
get

183
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,019
we got a lot of press coverage on this
and it's something that a lot of

184
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:49,540
projects

185
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,110
don't get but that they should get and
that they could get if they were maybe a

186
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,480
little bit more

187
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,899
I if they were if they if they pitch
their mission to people on the pitch

188
00:09:58,899 --> 00:09:59,850
what they were doing

189
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,110
and a little more concise way so I just
wanted a kinda

190
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,050
highlight that as as a something that we
really consciously focus on

191
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,379
from the front the front side of things

192
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,509
yep basically um the fifth magical thing
about the slide is that we didn't

193
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,899
send press releases to anyone we
actually like

194
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:22,310
I don't really know how we got picked up
but basically

195
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,170
Gizmodo I think found us and then
everyone else found us and like

196
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,269
almost week act it did cross our service
for about five minutes

197
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,399
arm and it was is bad ozanich CNN wolf
blitzer

198
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,399
you know is pretty ridiculous but yep
the sort of

199
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,759
the thing that we really want to get
across is we think the reason why we are

200
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,800
picked up is not just because this is a
cool project because there's millions a

201
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,389
core projects like Dean said

202
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:47,129
but it's because it's a cool project
that really easy for like mainstream

203
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:50,629
audiences to understand its it's a
project that you know

204
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:54,250
like the name is cutie or whatever but
you know it's it's very

205
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,850
apparent immediately um like what it is
and therefore

206
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,430
newspaper people are always looking for
easy stories like that to tell people so

207
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,089
if you can make your project accessible
enough

208
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:11,600
for reporters they're going to help you
get the idea that you want

209
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,029
and now we're gonna hang things over to
quittin who is one of the

210
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:20,660
folks have to go the back end

211
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,389
alright so I am a programmer at MIT I'm

212
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,060
ECS major rising junior now and

213
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,139
so I was part of the MIT free culture
movement and

214
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:34,579
these guys from Harvard came over and
said you know we have this really great

215
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:35,959
idea but we don't know

216
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:40,769
how did accomplish this can you can you
help us cover the plan

217
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,069
and so so we we came up with some some
objectives what we wanted to do was he

218
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,500
wanted to keep track of every video on
YouTube

219
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,939
and know instantly when they become
inaccessible and

220
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,719
this is really hard I'm YouTube really
doesn't even want people to know how

221
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,439
many videos on YouTube

222
00:11:57,439 --> 00:12:00,519
not even you know information about
whether they're

223
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,680
copper down or anything like that I so
we can't

224
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,959
we can't really do that and

225
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,139
we YouTube doesn't provide a feed of
saying you know this is

226
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,220
these are all the takedowns that
happened today I'm they do

227
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,000
for chilling effects now which is which
is a site that aggregates the

228
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,290
things that are taken down from Google
search results

229
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,019
but they don't for you too and part of
the reason is that YouTube is currently

230
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:25,329
in

231
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:28,740
embroiled in a lawsuit with viacom as
you may know

232
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,779
and so they're kinda secretive about
this so are we couldn't exactly do that

233
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:33,149
at all

234
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,569
are talking about what we can do so
serve

235
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:40,839
as a reminder the only way you find out
about video being down is that you get

236
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,740
a page that looks like this it says the
video is unavailable due to a copyright

237
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,860
claim by

238
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,870
true and you only get that if you look
at the video page

239
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:52,389
are and there's no there's no fee
there's no like mister the takedowns

240
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:53,600
that happened today

241
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,410
and in fact even take down videos that
have been taken down even show up on

242
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,459
other pages on YouTube you can still see
them and search results for a little

243
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:05,249
while you can still see them on our
homepage if they were popular

244
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:09,350
the data feeds datafeed still show the
videos for

245
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,620
minutes or hours after the videos taken
down and so the only way to see this on

246
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,930
the actual page when you try to look at
the video you get you know this but has

247
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,180
been taken down

248
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,449
are so note given given that that

249
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:25,370
requirement we sort of had to modify our
objectives I and we had to say well

250
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,740
let's keep track of all of the popular
and interesting videos

251
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,139
and when we say interesting we don't
necessarily mean

252
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,829
you know what people like we mean what
is currently being discussed

253
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,079
and we sorta tried to predict what we
think

254
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,509
people what we think would be likely to
be taken down so we think what would be

255
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:46,490
likely to be noticed

256
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,269
and we can't know immediately when
they're taking down but what we can do

257
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,499
is we can poll

258
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:54,850
periodically and find out soon as we can
when they've been taken down

259
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,709
I'm so so how did we accomplish this we
we wrote a whole bunch of

260
00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:02,259
modular components that can run on any
machine they currently are on one

261
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,100
machine but they don't have to

262
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,379
we designed this and and are approaching
the point where we can just

263
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,470
you know have someone brought a Python
script on their machine and

264
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,999
help with the scanning load for you Tim
so so we have these three different

265
00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:18,759
types and modular components we have
explorers which go out on the web and

266
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,740
look for the interesting videos

267
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,329
and he is very serious tix for
determining what are the interesting

268
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,350
videos

269
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,089
I'm we have a set of scanners which a
responsible for looking on YouTube site

270
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:31,220
and finding out steps in the videos the
metadata

271
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,240
number views title you know when things
change

272
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,360
and we also have ascetic our covers

273
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,439
which cash media related those videos

274
00:14:41,439 --> 00:14:44,800
and it's it's strike through an all
explain why in a minute but its

275
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,839
it strike for because that isn't all
quite in fermented and

276
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,069
and available to the public at no
explain why

277
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:56,839
I'm so so we we wrote a whole bunch
explores that look all over the web for

278
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,879
for things that for things that are
interesting I will go to Digg explore

279
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,370
which watches every video that anyone
posted Dec

280
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,110
ever we we don't we we washed the feet
that

281
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,639
that dick provides you can like refresh
up to once a minute I think that

282
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,269
just gives you every every single post
that someone puts up regardless how many

283
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:15,269
dicks it has

284
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:18,839
so that's really cool feed we get a lot
of interesting videos of their

285
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,370
we watched to Technorati video page
which is sort of the videos that are

286
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:24,420
being talked about in the blogosphere

287
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,449
they watch a whole bunch rss feeds and
find out

288
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:30,689
you know what what videos are popular et
cetera I'm

289
00:15:30,689 --> 00:15:33,329
and we've got a whole bunch of different
YouTube explores which look at the

290
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,350
various lists on YouTube I've

291
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,749
most popular Most Viewed today most you
know

292
00:15:38,749 --> 00:15:42,120
top-rated are all those different lists

293
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,930
and so these these explorers collect a
whole bunch of this

294
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,920
love basically just take the video ID
out of you know the URL if you ever see

295
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,029
your YouTube euro its

296
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:55,379
YouTube dot com slash watch question
vehicles and then this this like

297
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,939
12 character string that's the the video
I D

298
00:15:58,939 --> 00:16:02,949
and we just collect a whole bunch a
video I these and then we have

299
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:07,430
said scanner modules that look at this
this list if video ID's we call these

300
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,499
artifacts

301
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:11,759
the different videos were looking at so
we have the release least

302
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,509
least recently scan scanner which just
sequentially scans all the videos that

303
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,160
are down

304
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,980
and we just keep going through and
through the list and if you look on our

305
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,879
website on the statistics page we

306
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,160
actually show you how long it takes us
to get through the festivity owes

307
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,029
we have whole bunch of threads and we
try and just you know get

308
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,410
date get information about every video
as quickly as we can

309
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,639
unfortunately the only you too G Data
API is

310
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:39,579
getting for about 1 video so we do that
bunch of times

311
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:43,829
I'm and then we also didn't originally
think we would be this

312
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:47,730
but it turned out that we actually
needed to write a a dead scanner scanner

313
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,550
that would scam videos that we had seen
as debt

314
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:55,050
and it turns out that in more cases than
you would think those videos come back

315
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:58,300
and this is operate takedowns that have
been put back

316
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,889
of its not all cooperate takedowns and
we don't quite know why videos that are

317
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,899
down suddenly

318
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:06,260
suddenly become available again and

319
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,660
we'll talk a little bit more about some
other some other takedowns

320
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,459
a bit later and so then we have some are
covers and they are covers are

321
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:17,260
responsible for saving the large media
chunks

322
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,260
related to these things so we have a
thumbnail archiver

323
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:30,410
let me just what

324
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,470
someone was trying to which by far um

325
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,170
so we had so-so about Little Snitch that

326
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:41,860
do you want to allow this so we have a
thumbnail archiver that saves video

327
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,080
thumbnails

328
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,080
and the reason we do this is that the
thumbnails disappear

329
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,789
you know a few minutes or hours after
video gets taken down like the rest of

330
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:50,270
the country YouTube

331
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,370
I and so we need to save them so that we
can show them on our site some people

332
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:53,720
know

333
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,750
sort what we're talking about original
site didn't have thumbnails and

334
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,539
people were like why is there this this
video that was one of the most popular

335
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,730
videos on YouTube called

336
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,809
xxx porn and it's taken down now

337
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:08,408
by the way that was because it was
actually a clip of My Little Pony

338
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:13,080
which was a TV show from like 10 years
has anyone seen that video on YouTube

339
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,510
yeah exactly I'm we were like why is
this video taken down

340
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,149
I'm but yet so there was one the most
popular videos was on the U-two

341
00:18:21,149 --> 00:18:25,000
most popular lest it had you know 100
million views or something like that

342
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,649
I'm so so we do that and we we save
these thumbnails

343
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,380
and we show them under Fair Use because
we we say this is this is you know

344
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,399
this is commentary about YouTube in
about this video

345
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,270
we need to give people a you know
something that's representative the

346
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:42,529
video but not confused with the video
it's just a thumbnail

347
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:45,340
and then we also haven't fully
implemented a video archive for which we

348
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,039
actually save the video files for later
review

349
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:51,408
on and we're still working with lawyers
right now trying to figure out just how

350
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:52,860
far we can go there

351
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,340
I whether we can actually show videos
that YouTube says are copyright

352
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,620
infringements

353
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,590
I'm and it's important to know with the
DMCA that you're only required to take

354
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,809
something down

355
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,990
if you actually get a legitimate DMC
request that follows the requirements in

356
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,200
the DMCA law

357
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,760
and then you are required to take it
down you are not required to take it

358
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,200
down just because someone says

359
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,480
that video is a is a copyright violation
they need to follow very specific format

360
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,890
so it's not clear whether I'm whether we
can actually say

361
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,620
we can show videos when some other site
has taken it down because

362
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,039
they say that they received taken on a
sec I'm so we're still working out with

363
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,470
flowers on that

364
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,370
been US all these modules they take
collect a whole bunch for information

365
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,390
and they stuff it into a my single
database

366
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,929
II not because my sick was the best
database but because it's what we had it

367
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,169
freely available at MIT

368
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:46,620
so we stuff everything and bicycle
database as a last night

369
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,409
we had about to turn a 2000 rose in the
artifacts table so we're watching

370
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:55,230
you know quarter-million videos which is
not not all if you too by any stretch of

371
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,460
imagination

372
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,330
but we get a nice wide swath have of the
videos that on YouTube and hopefully

373
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:03,610
a somewhat representative sample though
it its nots such a sickly a

374
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,770
representative sample

375
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,980
so the artifacts take up you know a
couple hundred megabytes

376
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,390
and then we save every piece of
information we have ever collected from

377
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,039
you too

378
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:15,360
ever I we currently have about 70,000

379
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,110
seventy million rows in 32 gigs and this
is

380
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,350
like five or ten snap shots per second a
different videos

381
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,600
we skip every piece of information we've
ever collected the idea being that

382
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,559
you is gonna be useful for someone to be
able to go on mine and information

383
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,720
we don't know for sure now what's going
to be what's going to be interesting

384
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,370
but we need to collect it now because if
the video gets taken down we can see all

385
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,850
that information

386
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,000
if you want to look at this we have a
public my single database

387
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,500
that's just set aside for anonymous
access I

388
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,200
and you can just check out our blog
there for information about how to

389
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
access our bicycle database

390
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,929
and for inquiries against our data on if
you

391
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,690
are joke too constricted by the web
interface so that sort of his

392
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,620
is how we do this on so it's all pipes
on

393
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,720
its you know we have a whole bunch
different modules that are

394
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,500
completely independent except for
sharing a database

395
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,299
and the web interface is a Python cherry
kayak that sits on top of it

396
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:15,760
and it's all you know pretty much
earlier and if runs on

397
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,850
cluster 5 surfers at MIT so so that sort
it is our technical architecture

398
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,990
I'm not gonna talk turn it over to
oliver who is

399
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,090
Hereford person Crewe who

400
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,668
sorta did some research on you know what
is the status say and one of the things

401
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,019
we found was

402
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:39,019
geolocation of filtering he's sorta
fully with

403
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:44,029
flow abandons all over day and I

404
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,539
got interested in this project because a
an email was passed

405
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,789
to me and arm while they were figuring
out the XML format

406
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,120
offer the API they found this really
interesting tag

407
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,010
are and if you look where the the little
arrow is pointing

408
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,408
arm you can see media restriction Thai
people

409
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:07,090
type equal country relationship people
deny

410
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,139
are and then it's usually a list
upcountry coz

411
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,070
arm so if you think about like the way
this project is working we're studying

412
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,850
take down this is in effect

413
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:18,130
a soft take down this is saying we're
gonna let

414
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,830
everywhere in the world see this video
except for this list

415
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,210
are in the first one we saw was actually
China and that's actually why I got so

416
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,429
interested that the work it oh and I

417
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,640
other I do we study the Great Firewall
and and what things are really pissing

418
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,250
off the Chinese government

419
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,750
um and and I'll get to that and a few
minutes

420
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:41,080
a so what it looks like if you're in one
of these countries writers goip

421
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,289
right so it'll say your IP is from this
country a

422
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:47,390
and if your country equals that code

423
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:51,519
you'll get this little pink far that
says this video is not available in your

424
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:52,279
country

425
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,750
now obviously anyone %uh that has two
four or a proxy or anything can bypass

426
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,390
is pretty quickly

427
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,690
I'll but anyway YouTube has a

428
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,880
done this probably because it's keeping
certain countries from

429
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,440
black calling them in in BGP routing
tables and turning it off for the entire

430
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,480
world

431
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,970
yeah like Pakistan did um and so

432
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,580
a you know once we started a collecting
data on this

433
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,049
a I went to the database and started
trying to analyze

434
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,289
whatever groupings there were as far as
the country codes Armin

435
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:28,460
and what we found was actually pretty
interesting not all the stuff you find

436
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,760
are make sense at first are this video

437
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,490
is about tibet rate this is the the
rights in tibet

438
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:38,769
I it was from someone in Jap Japan

439
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:42,240
up it was blocked in Germany France

440
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,350
I and a bunch of stuff that's owned by
France

441
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,140
a and if you look at that middle
thumbnail

442
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,860
you'll see there's actually a tiny
swastika are men so what had happen was

443
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,600
someone had made a reference to the
nazis

444
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,429
are and and because he'd speeches ban
are in Germany

445
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:02,679
France Colin and apparently all offenses
territories

446
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:06,409
um this is kind of the deal that was
struck between you two

447
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:09,320
and these countries is that we will go
ahead and block these things from

448
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,730
showing up in your country

449
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:16,059
so you don't just able all other
citizens from being able to see you too

450
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,120
arm so it's ridiculous rate this is an
old

451
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,450
walt Disney cartoon of Donald Duck where
he apparently turns into a Nazi for a

452
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,130
few

453
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,899
frames are and again banned in Germany

454
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:31,289
France poland and so this is what I've
been calling to hate speech block

455
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:34,539
and now I can go through the database
and look for this block in every time I

456
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,019
see that I know it's some type of hate
speech

457
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,679
although the sensor not talking about it
we have to make all our own assumptions

458
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:42,000
and

459
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,330
and sometimes I mean it doesn't seem to
make as much sense

460
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,860
I included this in case anyone wanted to
know what the hell have those two

461
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,750
letters

462
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:54,200
a country codes were I had to look
closer them up and and and the Wikipedia

463
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,580
articles are fascinating

464
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,449
if you ever get around to it so the
first really interesting when we found

465
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,610
was in Thailand

466
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,480
arm is anyone familiar with less Majesta
I i can speak French so I'm probably put

467
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,820
a ring that

468
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:12,289
so less majeste is a law great and it
says you cannot impugn the King

469
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:15,158
arm and and if you think about how
ridiculous that would be if you went to

470
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:17,010
jail for making fun a bush

471
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,120
are this law says and their reporters
that have

472
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,710
have gone into jail for this if you make
for the King you can go to jail for up

473
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,429
to 15 years

474
00:25:25,429 --> 00:25:28,450
and this is for any type of criticism of
his policy

475
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,789
or what he's wearing anything I'll these
videos

476
00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:36,440
up basically cause Thailand to say

477
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:40,190
we're not allowing you to that our
country anymore I'll

478
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,549
as or get into a deal was struck
probably behind closed doors

479
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:47,070
are where they said well we have this
thing in place we can make sure that

480
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,460
videos do not show up

481
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,220
in Thailand I'll and it's interesting
because we started watching

482
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,860
the girl wilder videos when Pakistan
said blew up and said

483
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,899
screw you guys we're we're turning off
due to arm and they haven't been banding

484
00:25:59,899 --> 00:26:02,490
so it's again very unclear

485
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:06,169
why they make these decisions when they
may come are

486
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:09,620
and and then we have our country

487
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,779
I so is a wonderfully with Soulja Boy

488
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,240
couple couple people look at up so
Soulja Boy sign recent

489
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,389
awake a while ago I guess up and so we
do things differently here right we've

490
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:26,490
a we can make fun a bush but you just
could not push it up

491
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,220
if if somebody else's said it first
apparently I it so

492
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,720
these are all love the band the
country's for Soulja Boy's video

493
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,610
now we don't think these countries are
pissed off its older boy we we think

494
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:39,750
that all

495
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,380
I mean are up our current theory is that

496
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,210
since a lot of music videos are optioned
by country

497
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,090
that's how they're doing this and so
it's it's kind of like a region encoding

498
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,360
for DVD's

499
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,389
up and actually had the lake create a
really quick script

500
00:26:54,389 --> 00:26:58,690
on that would tell me what countries
your actually allowed to see the video n

501
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:02,220
arm cuz there's there's a little over
two hundred country codes and

502
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,299
available and and I so Standard & I
think that this is about 200

503
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:11,559
a so utterly are talking about china and
interestingly the

504
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:16,519
only videos better only blocked in China
are from the NBA

505
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:21,139
I am for really not sure what's going on
at the NBA

506
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:24,570
are we define is really interesting
story I

507
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,559
that the guy that used to work for
Microsoft and was in charge of licensing

508
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,649
in China

509
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,889
was snagged by the NBA are men so he
works for them now

510
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:37,679
so we think that might have something to
do with this others a little over 450

511
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,460
videos right now that we're tracking

512
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,929
that are all bad it's just China right
like it's not

513
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:46,840
like this where it's like a superset
right like your your china is part of

514
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,429
this huge list by the way by the way you
cannot see

515
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:53,070
Soulja Boy in China a but in this case
it's literally

516
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,189
just China they cannot view NBA videos

517
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,789
are so

518
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:03,908
we're I also on this list sometimes

519
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:07,399
these actually make this is kinda hard
WTF list we

520
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:13,730
really don't understand what's on here
this stuff is banned in just the US

521
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,600
broke back mountain okay maybe but there
The Fresh Prince of bel-air we don't

522
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,389
really get

523
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:23,159
on rickrolling is back up now but it was
blocked in the US for a while

524
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,470
I love Eunos

525
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,100
Yeah what about yeah ask you to recall
the entire audience but I didn't want to

526
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,679
be like

527
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:34,649
hit or pelted with things a so

528
00:28:34,649 --> 00:28:38,590
again you know that sometimes it's its
when we haven't really care a

529
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:42,360
really worked on this yet but it for us
if we try and look at it from the US

530
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,200
it'll come up as

531
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,389
down coal and other so I'll

532
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:49,419
some others videos might still be up in
a few people from other countries again

533
00:28:49,419 --> 00:28:50,350
toward

534
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,389
yeah we don't know tours really great
for this cuz you can pop out in another

535
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:54,429
country

536
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:57,639
I'm check that out so I've been doing
this all three database interface which

537
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,580
is now available to you guys

538
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,710
arm and you can look at this it's
there's a column called ban countries

539
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,049
our man if it's not an old enemy that
span somewhere and you can

540
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:11,059
check that out um we've also kinda
opened up up

541
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:15,129
soma interface ideas where this just a
mock-up we haven't actually implemented

542
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:15,980
the shit

543
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:21,460
well right yeah there's a map right now
to show you a little red

544
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,350
%uh countries that a will be like where
they're banded

545
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,759
um but this is gonna pick up the web
interface that that we show at some

546
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,320
point in the near future

547
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,450
soon as Dean gets to work on that

548
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,870
up so anyway we really want this to be
interactively wanted to open it up to

549
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,830
questions

550
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:41,830
arm and before we do that you know we
just wanted to

551

558
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:18,190
the whole the long answer is we're
obviously the whole

559
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:22,080
and we're all students you know

560

stuff so it do %uh like we would like to

561
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:32,580
implement other stuff help

562
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,330
flow I've got about 20 a one-hour videos
on Google

563
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:48,559
I'm but to a which up up in the last
year and a half

564
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,710
and about to I know a few months ago

565
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,980
you know until a few months ago they are

566
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,200
counter you know they're to check to see
its

567
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,400
in the downloads a very video

568
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,530
was working fine and that stop

569
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,210
I don't what happened also a troubled
download uploading anymore with more

570
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:09,809
videos

571
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:12,940
I don't know what's happening so you
have any idea of going on

572
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,929
but you guys have interesting stories
like that

573
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:22,150
email us we do if you can send us the
links to the videos well we can be

574
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,350
stride

575
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,820
ourselves this thing

576
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,210
I think it and works I'm onassis
swastikas were

577
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,360
auto lost factory the country's because

578
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,920
presumably like it or not autoblog need
someone in Germany or whatever

579
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,970
manually satellite me reference the
nazis

580
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:50,090
so bad that it must be iraq so I mean
this is this is a great question right

581
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,530
and

582
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,750
apart for the fall nation for this
project is that it's such an OK process

583
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,020
we have no idea when the test that I've
wanted to do obviously not a correct

584
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:02,660
my name on it is I like one of those
does that happen

585
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,290
for swastika and just know me I am
you're so that it kind of creates

586
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:11,580
you know actual swastika so I don't seem
like a naughty pics back

587
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,678
by baby Tripp you know this this little

588
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,140
play we're assuming there is some types
masakela actor there

589
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:25,140
there certainly is a textual detector
histories

590
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:33,340
yourself video that has all the serious
like signs a

591
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,880
you just make sure that has no views and
that

592
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,380
X Street Fort test for so I don't wanna
ask about

593
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,980
the on so where the NDA was blocked in
China I can see no reason why

594
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,710
only some it's not just ones about
domain

595
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:54,790
is that was my first okay yeah I know so
I mean on presumably China has no

596
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,168
opinion on on the

597
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:00,179
on videos on but if they might so I
guess

598
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,919
I see more likely that the NBA would be
more to complain about

599
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,470
allies few the MBA market in China has
jumped

600
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,490
like hugely after docs

601
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:16,300
its so because huge market over there

602
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,490
let's try to make money off the best
Pirates

603
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:25,630
right so by so it's also only if you
detect it was the country that

604
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,860
plane was the right for the complaint
based on

605
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,380
I down other or down copyright yet with
the

606
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,200
the geolocation stuff it's just a field
inside the XML file there's no reason

607
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,559
that are given or BB had the reason
they're on the slice

608
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,840
so that was text string shows up track

609
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,169
i sat down others just recognized
strings

610
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,450
ok things was inaccessible York

611
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:53,510
because we're scanning US US

612
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:58,830
see actions and obviously another thing
to keep in mind is that

613
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,270
these are just user with

614
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,250
to you gives countries content creators

615
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:11,389
China most likely lost X

616
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,510
I can talk about that a little bit later
my question

617
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,770
but I've actually in some experiments
and

618
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,830
China has very advanced packet filtering
system

619
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:29,560
the pic tax things has them off and just
a few questions first

620
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,230
you contact you too see was their
reaction to this

621
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:37,609
react we

622
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:40,739
we first contacted like the first thing
before

623
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,960
call like

624
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,330
like state we talk

625
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:57,569
showing a fax said past with part of the
quietness might be

626
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:02,670
by Haas skied without

627
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:09,670
from trying at least you guys

628
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,880
use the example love like

629
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,780
video where the guys yes

630
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,780
ago as I understand it

631
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,620
yeah finger the problem was that
huffington post claim thing on demand

632
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:49,970
after

633
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:56,970
its video I'm wondering if you guys know
done it

634
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:08,080
both sensitive tests and if you wanna
help

635
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,800
like we're more than happy to %uh to
bring you a default time

636
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,450
the OraQuick a lively

637
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,819
below orkut for the case well as

638
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:28,210
about the one hour a uploading

639
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:32,380
I with Julia Google you too

640
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:35,930
they normally do like it now alright
uploads

641
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,980
so that is probably why you could no
longer upload anything

642
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,050
hour-long video because who

643
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:47,830
YouTube the same just you policy know
the kids who are

644
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,480
you to actually does count tracking all
that help hits and all that

645
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,720
has has the temp started being a
practical your

646
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,600
used to only be YouTube I'm just
understand

647
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:02,640
decisive speculating right now because
to the fact that he is no longer able

648
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,640
now video question

649
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:15,930
given the relative simplicity

650
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,190
relative popularity

651
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:25,319
things like says souls

652
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:28,980
your stop

653
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,980
for something free

654
00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:42,190
thats

655
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,339
I can't get too much closer I so that
the

656
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:48,940
the question the question was basically
kept can we do

657
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,029
what setting at home unfolding at home
were doing and distribute some kind of

658
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:52,799
client that

659
00:37:52,799 --> 00:37:56,420
that can crawl right you know from
species

660
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,880
feces said yeah

661
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,130
free so we've we've talked about that
definitely

662
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,769
right now our infrastructure is not
careful supporting

663
00:38:07,769 --> 00:38:11,980
we're not capable of handling the the
scan results that would come in

664
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,900
and also were a little concerned about
about

665
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,460
people poisoning our data by allowing
decisions like that

666
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:26,460
but it is an idea that we've done sir
talk questions

667
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,710
wants to show you some takedowns we can
take

668
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:40,510
site

669
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,930
all

670
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:47,419
its

671
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,269
no we're not gonna show you the cast so

672
00:38:51,269 --> 00:38:54,599
so this is what the site looks like does
anyone know something

673
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,380
like search researchers life now

674
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,210
way we just added search functionality
our I was like the number one

675
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:07,759
FEMA all the emails you guys like has
thought about a search bar

676
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:11,890
yeah we thought yes thinking about it
people

677
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:16,500
on alike search for anonymous so of
course

678
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,910
this sixty number copyright takedowns if
you go to

679
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,000
browser whatever bra size on the the
copyright like the copyright holders

680
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,509
that issued a takedown notices

681
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:29,410
and I think there's like 20 or so arm
have been issued by the Church of

682
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,190
Scientology

683
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,779
so so stop there the salad takedowns

684
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:36,849
these are these are all available
there's one here that was from by the

685
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:37,460
user

686
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,720
there was one that was removed

687
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,259
as a Terms of Service violation that
actually looks and synonymous to me

688
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:48,420
leader interestingly enough some upbeat

689
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,849
copyright violation takedowns are listed
under terms user violation and we think

690
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,220
that's just tough action

691
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:58,019
a factor of how to violations reported
or not absolutely

692
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:04,849
as interesting video

693
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:08,670
I'm not gonna watch it let's let's look
at the things they're taking down by the

694
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:08,970
church

695
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,680
sign fixed assets show all of its

696
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,140
takedowns that we've seen so if you find

697
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:23,930
workers Church of Scientology national

698
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:28,589
16 so this is the time for this video

699
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:35,549
sever narva time trees video he acts
like a complete idiot

700
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,250
of I'm

701
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:42,050
price is one of six so

702
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,340
so it actually looks like we haven't
seen a sign how to take down a long time

703
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,160
kinda surprising maybe there's may be
anonymised succeeding or something but

704
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,690
we did we did see around a anonymous

705
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,730
sorta Lake takedowns and then
reinstatement say

706
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,050
one other things that can happen is if
your user account got suspended than %ah

707
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,060
love your videos disappear from you too

708
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,920
so they were doing there is some kinda
back and forth and there is you know

709
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,510
notta lotta transparency we saw some
other on the site

710
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,710
I there's another man's there's an
automated process that

711
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:18,119
if they get certain number of operate
takedowns or

712
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,750
or individual video Terms of Service
violations that YouTube will

713
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:27,080
suspend the account and this is to do
one other causes in the DMCA that says

714
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,450
you know you have to also take steps to
try and prevent this in the future see

715
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,630
have some kind of policy will black
people

716
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,810
that got to me take downs and it's
actually kinda have

717
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,609
kinda interesting that you don't
actually need to known for sure that

718
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:43,799
these are filing videos you just have to
receive

719
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,820
takedowns if you don't like someone you
can go fine three

720
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:50,320
three or four videos that they post on
YouTube and some takedowns

721
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,619
and in all likelihood they're not going
to actually bother contesting the

722
00:41:53,619 --> 00:41:54,359
takedowns

723
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:58,020
on and thats wanna one of the things we
want to do is make sure that people are

724
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,080
educated about

725
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,109
the fact that yes you can actually say
know this video is not infringing

726
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,119
and YouTube it's hard to put it back up
I'm

727
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:09,640
so if you get if you get three for
takedowns then

728
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,660
you too obliged to suspend your account
regardless of whether they're legitimate

729
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,170
or not

730
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:19,810
is a law

731
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:24,200
it is the law yes that the NCAA Digital
Millennium Copyright Act

732
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,570
yeah it says that they're required to
take them down within 10 days I think

733
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:34,109
so not sure so there's a there's short
number of days that their part take them

734
00:42:34,109 --> 00:42:37,640
take the video down after after
receiving the

735
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,220
legitimate takedown notice and then you
have I think 14

736
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,900
days to now you can you can file a
counterclaim

737
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,580
to to you too and they're required to
put it back up

738
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,480
within 14 days are kevin was able to get
it for you

739
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,910
14 days on the apt for the counterclaim
onto the original

740
00:42:55,910 --> 00:43:00,069
claimant and if if the original claim it
doesn't file a lawsuit against you

741
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:02,339
within 14 days the required to put it
back up

742
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:05,520
and if you're interested in more details
on the MCA

743
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,280
you can search for for and the About
section there's actually a link to a

744
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,109
counterclaim

745
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:13,509
of for so you look in our FAQ here

746
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,730
yeah my stuff

747
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:20,030
got taken down right finally DMCA
counterclaims

748
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:24,180
and this this is attack looks like its
big but it's really just simple

749
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,730
explains how you can determine if it's
actually a legitimate and if so

750
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:35,730
how you you can file a counter are there
any other questions

751
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:45,540
um before we wrap this up I just wanted
to say

752
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,410
on there some folks from Creative
Commons here they're gonna be doing a

753
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,230
workshop

754
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,420
om right after this down in the second
floor the

755
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,320
right next to where the segways were in
their capture the flag area so anyone

756
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,310
