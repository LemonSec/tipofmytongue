1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,220
IOM

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,910
I'm Darren and this is the talk about
the installation art gallery guys have

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,509
been seen down on them as mean

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:18,529
on I have five artists today Albert
playing Randy Palumbo

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:21,670
James years John Montgomery

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,270
and Ericsson on

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,470
and we're basically everybody's going to
get a little presentation on the

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,220
installation that they have downstairs

9
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,309
on first I'm just gonna say a few words

10
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:37,650
on about art our technology

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,000
on are just like technology evolves over
time in its directly affected

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,100
by advances in technology and thought on

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,680
when painting was invented

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,800
on pain compounds developed techniques
were finding you got more technically

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,320
to refined paintings sculptor became
more realistic as

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,030
the tools were perfected in people learn
more about perspective and form

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,299
and sizing in the materials they were
working with and then we got the

18
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:09,830
Industrial Revolution

19
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,140
and art on

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,560
join the same logarithmic scales
technology development you got things

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,810
like photography was invented news
cultural TX were

22
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,090
perfected on people begin using

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,930
welding and wire word and a lot of
things that they had news for

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,789
the past several hundred years and with
the advent have a critical mass in

25
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,829
technology

26
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,740
and the dish enough now the
accessibility of technology to general

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,719
user base

28
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,270
so many more people are taking

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,380
technological elements creative with
their

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,719
on and in these innovative innovations
in art

31
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,359
are their hacking attacking materials
hacking concept tracking ID is hacking

32
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,020
how

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,740
something and an ordinary object to be
taking in views are used in totally

34
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,659
different ways

35
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:07,840
on or you can reveal new aspects of
something that weren't necessarily

36
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,210
visible to the public before like like
clear box devices where you can see all

37
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,590
the circuitry inside them

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,060
on installation interactive art

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,130
is 18 relatively new subset a bar as a
whole

40
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,390
and the its aim is to in general

41
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,860
sheer inexperience with the viewer

42
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,670
to cause them to think about something
anyway on

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,069
to show them something they've never
seen before which is kind of a memo

44
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,980
start but in this case it's drying the
user in

45
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,280
you interact with something you're part
of the art instead of just

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,019
an observer on all the advances in small
electronics

47
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:52,069
and circuit circuitry on most people are
now

48
00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:55,560
working with things like hardly know
creating their own

49
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,120
small devices using circuit boards on

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,270
combining them with new visual display
techniques using combinations avoiding

51
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,240
devices

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,670
late interruptions LED's on

53
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,700
neon wire projection and

54
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,360
so many other different things to create
just totally new

55
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,740
configurations and today we have

56
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,140
organizations things like torque rod NYC
resistor make magazine and IC resistor

57
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,160
make magazine /url

58
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,520
both here on sites like Instructables
and see where

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,960
you can get advice on a

60
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,440
home use a technology and ideas

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,750
for new wanna new projects

62
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,100
and therefore people training networking
make innovations in our

63
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,300
and make stuff that is both useful and
surgeons

64
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:52,770
aesthetic purpose in some way I'm going
to shut up now and I'm going to

65
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,740
introduce using

66
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,790
first I'm going to have Albert playing
come up

67
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,429
and is a his art piece is a wire map and
it's a combination

68
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,450
projection and wires

69
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:10,260
Jeep

70
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:17,260
its yield act up

71
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,859
everybody my name is Albert Wong I am
the developer and designer be on the

72
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,630
wire

73
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,420
effect get this up

74
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,200
you know the resolution on this your

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,479
thinkin that

76
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,080
I'm great the wire members a biometric
3d render and what that means is it

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,460
takes

78
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,560
digital image arena posts in the real 3d
space like three spaces

79
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,300
United I'm and it does this

80
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,610
a by using a projector and a bunch of
threads for the projector

81
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,030
shoes image into a lotta thread a

82
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,660
and it creates a biometric image inside
so all

83
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,830
play a little video that I'm

84
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,659
so that as a globe for around it is

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,430
a video in the videos two dimensions so
basically what this video screens on

86
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,590
doing all the work that I've done two
maybe three

87
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,250
up so you can really see it but I don't

88
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,840
there are few people in the room that
i've seen and the King

89
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,260
certainly tell you it's more impressive
in person I'm

90
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,219
that his on video but you can we get a
sense

91
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,950
what's going on here so those are a
little piece the threat I

92
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,300
and there are vertically hanging
projectors standing

93
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,479
far away I'm looking at it

94
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,860
and shooting like into it I'm it took a
lot of calibration

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,220
and I have some

96
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,310
here this is not the same model but this
is a model

97
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,250
love what is sorta going on when you got
up here these are

98
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,870
rays of light actually this is a program
that is running currently

99
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,180
on each one of these little pieces have
slivers away

100
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,660
going in each one of those maps 21
stringer

101
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,040
Saver won 2-1 on that I'm and that
string as a randomized at

102
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,110
I wanted to be random things that in one
parents to occur

103
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,580
because often when people see 3d think
but they have to send a particular place

104
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,310
in a pattern will just reinforce that

105
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,760
so I randomized adaptive I'm

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,490
and this pushed into Ubuntu strings mix
03 go up

107
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,030
a this is the pattern I'm

108
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,120
this is not the exact same model but
it's the same concept

109
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,229
a each one of these I'm going up and
down

110
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,070
represents a verner are mothers vertical
strips a flight one of these things

111
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,130
as it travels through space from the
projector the focal point being

112
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:56,430
I'm all the way down past the for

113
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,350
weather protective suits I'm and those
little dots are the intersections

114
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,390
that's where the thread lies

115
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,870
so I'm yeah a lot of people ask me like
where I got the inspiration to do

116
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,760
something like this

117
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,270
I actually come from theater I and three
decomposition is

118
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,510
like a major important part of that but
one other wanna

119
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,409
sources that definitely have decided
this guy named Jeff Hahn he made the

120
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:23,479
multi-touch display its tour around
smacks of right now

121
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,539
I and he to he also developed a concept
called the whole a dust

122
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:33,169
what is the field is a big box with dust
particles falling down an infrared laser

123
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:33,840
Trac said

124
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,620
and anytime it's a particle that its

125
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,860
suppose to light up according to mom
when the computer then visible laser

126
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,030
hits and reflects

127
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,440
and that we can build a 3d object a fat

128
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,900
on I decided to do that with but just
ring

129
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,909
I'm it's easier its simple it just takes
a projector and about a threat and a lot

130
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:54,610
of time

131
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,090
I am and

132
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:03,260
the I actually I came if in high school
I played a lot of counter-strike

133
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,450
and i'd like took a break I want a few
to school for four years

134
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,890
I'm and then when I got it in theater I
didn't want to be in fear again so

135
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,610
attractive

136
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,890
computers and and when I came back a lot
of digital 3d technology was

137
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,409
I thought all that work love like
creating 3d environments and

138
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:23,940
and all that stuff was being compressed
back into the because the only way you

139
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,969
interact with 3d environments is

140
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:29,830
through TV screens a through a computer
screen or whatever and

141
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,539
and what I want to do is to create that
that this real sense is being somewhere

142
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,090
being

143
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,520
watching a sporting event or watching I
watching

144
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,429
looking at a statue if you go to the mat
and looking like a romance actually

145
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,940
you're going to have a

146
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,030
I'm your body is going to have a
reaction to just looking at something

147
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,610
that is there so when you

148
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,850
actually come by I'm you definitely get
a sense of what's going on

149
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,100
on I think that's it a

150
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,760
difficult by on the second floor are
right next to the elevators which i

151
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,290
think are working now

152
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,969
I'm any case go towards world caution
tape is

153
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,279
because I scarf with your answer I'm
yeah

154
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,560
are you ready for

155
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,750
on

156
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,180
okay thanks I'm yet make sure you go see
it is actually really cool its

157
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,000
it's in a Big Ten on next up we have

166
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,010
and by the way Christine already said it
on that stuff that

167
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,189
I would like to set something up very
fast and I love

year ago and I took an external hard

171
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,950
drive and it wouldn't boot up for some
reason so I can give it

172
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,890
so I want to recycle that presentation
can I think shit before

173
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:27,490
so we're today an appetite for
everything

174
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,450
a.m. and talk about why it's hard for me
to paint for a few minutes

175
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,510
and I'm not really in talk about this
you there any case you guys for all see

176
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,029
very savvy

177
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:40,620
and simi and me talk about a new piece

178
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,600
that I'm working on right now to mess it
up downstairs after the stock

179
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,200
on so the way I got into

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,839
painting and why it's so difficult for
me to pay me I grew up

181
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,120
in the suburbs of Boston Wellesley
Massachusetts and I read a lot of books

182
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,580
and then eventually out about to go to
movies and

183
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:04,080
Europe billboards and stuff and I didn't
really get to watch TV very much but

184
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,130
it was like around right and that's one
reason seven years

185
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,290
i press limited anyway I'm

186
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,719
at the end of high school I went to

187
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,050
and Europe and I went to Russia and that
was like a PTO because

188
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,360
know very where they went to Russia at
that time and

189
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,760
Port Jefferson Prime Minister and I saw

190
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,370
of the psych amazing paintings and I had
like not been exposed to pains before

191
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,600
kiss they weren't around and I must well

192
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,760
was amazing and then and know what to do
after that

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,720
and then Anish

194
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,040
I and until then I never give up any
because it's all like a

195
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,280
into a cave paintings have

196
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,520
tie and creatures or whatever and then
plants

197
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,850
and then like both the fruit and I did
not go on paying was sewers only

198
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,210
until on I saw these like

199
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,730
abstract paintings have kandinsky stocks
and penny got exciting for me

200
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,850
on and there's less than a century about
Shekhar

201
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,430
in our and I history so that's what it's
like to have a penny

202
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,990
is like seeing something that doesn't
exist outside of pain

203
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,050
its getting to the world the campus

204
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,490
and I'm off to is on a huge US is the
dry and I did in the Rothko Chapel in

205
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,440
Texas

206
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,980
and that are after painting on the right
there away

207
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,490
and I'm so what when I for just one of
the shop is this what a feeling

208
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,490
that that I'm omitted right

209
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:39,120
his they've been all these amazing
artists Anna

210
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,310
it's really hard to to think what can
you contribute are going forward

211
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,140
I'm so thats what ive my kids painting
is gonna make something is blank space

212
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,630
but

213
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,530
I'm overshadowed by Rebecca and he
married and I can talk about

214
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,400
to Christina said and other thrust fires
for two BR

215
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,330
but anyway she said i okay what she said

216
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,530
and then I'm gonna study so this is a
piece and I brought this

217
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,470
painting yesterday to hang up and I
configure hang up happening on the wall

218
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:06,730
which

219
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,990
can't do Convention Center site went to
you guys right now

220
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:13,640
so my work involves I mean I use any
computer

221
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,949
processing and you to have things are
always changing but I'm also really

222
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,870
interested

223
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,170
in the expanding how it if the painter
and I use projection

224
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,560
and I project on to paint see get
combinations of colors

225
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,950
so if you protect yellow onto another
color or in this case were you looking

226
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,470
at

227
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,570

right sites when she goes very quickly

228
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,120
its the let's play concise

229
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,120

as

293
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,250

296
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,490
I love making things you things are not
supposed to do which

297
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:44,299
in our world there's a history of that
Marcel Duchamp pin and in the

298
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:49,059
80's 90's other people but I like kinda
like the way the hacker community does

299
00:18:49,059 --> 00:18:49,668
it better

300
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:53,380
on when things are taking a hundred
context in

301
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,090
me to do something way better than what
they were supposed to do and it just

302
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,178
makes the world a

303
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,570
Richard place and I think it makes make
some %uh vous fit in better to

304
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,500
made always made me feel better when
2600 comes are allowed under some crazy

I also build on if anyone a review

311
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,049
technology on well millionaires

312
00:19:32,049 --> 00:19:36,190
billionaires first millionaires now
billionaires

313
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,970
right when you're ready when you want to
really cool off the grid summer house

314
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,139
may not have traction

315
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:44,539
old shipping containers with composting
toilets on

316
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,320
call me that's my summer houses burned
up which you can see in the corner

317
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,000
but it's actually still just as good as
it ever was except for some nine

318
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,159
hundred-year-old pinon pine trees being
gone

319
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:59,870
and my neighbors laugh at me but I have
hot water I'm electricity

320
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,600
Anna none of them lost their home but I
still have more services than them

321
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,690
that's enough I that's outside of joshua
tree where my

322
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,200
kinda means to you is because it's a
really fun place to work

323
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,409
in this quite a lot of weirdos and
outlaws there that

324
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:19,620
they're doing interesting things to that
so inexpensive to live

325
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,840
if you want a home with if you don't
need glass in the windows are plumbing

326
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,730
you can still get

327
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,399
house in Joshua Tree on your credit card
and have much of the limit leftover

328
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:32,100
so this is Buttercup which is up but the

329
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,179
the top of the stairs this is in Joshua
Tree on

330
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:38,179
outside a little gallery called our
community that I have fun

331
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:41,750
so first put that out there and everyone
loved it

332
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,830
see the kids going crazy mister underage

333
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,230
drinking kids but filled skip over that
on

334
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,299
and then very quickly the reference

335
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,870
Joey I think Gerry Josephs and his wife

336
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,690
from Jesus's house a prayer who had the
misfortune to rent space from me in the

337
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,250
same complex

338
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,960
call the Highway Patrol and had
buttercup covered up can you believe

339
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,580
that

340
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,110
and my own place I'm

341
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,690
says his car but but they covered it up

342
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,929
with a translucent tarpon they come made
this kind of interactive

343
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:18,230
performance piece that was even better
yeah

344
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,010
and then I take their ass out there and
bennett now it's back to its original

345
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,520
beauty

346
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,710
and it's always there if you ever in
downtown Joshua Tree you see that

347
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:30,010
glowing softly by the highway

348
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,020
amend its kind ever redemption bolted

349
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,049
buttercup on the back to this old
nineteen forties bus

350
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,370
that I'm fixing up to run on I have a
little bio diesel gas station

351
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,580
it's also it's off the grid so when I
get in trouble I just move it a little

352
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,189
bit

353
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,820
and has yeah a solar panel and a car
battery and

354
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,570
it moves it gets around yeah you have to
it's called

355
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,289
turkey town biodiesel if you need to
refill in the neighborhood there's a

356
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:59,480
I'll tell you the combination to on the
honor system

357
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,679
recusal thankfully several thousand
gallons of fuel in the last couple years

358
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,210
so than I decided to take it to Burning
Man where would be more

359
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,450
appreciated i've never been there and
people always said to go there

360
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,940
on I cloture

361
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,000
on Anna

362
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,929
so was a big hit their even the police
in Nevada wisely realized they should

363
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:24,559
just pull me over and take pictures and
say how cool was

364
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,200
yeah

365
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,909
how many people go to Burning Man From
Here anybody alright

366
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:34,809
i was thinkin have only been once I'm
going again and I'm doing a huge

367
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,470
installation this time

368
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,940
I think it needs more hackers there's
are there any hippies in the room today

369
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:44,490
one to have you sorry I love hippies

370
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:47,820
but there's a lot of hippies there there
are like forty thousand if he's there in

371
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,110
ten thousand

372
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,950
and and it is still expensive to get in
but if you do an art project to some

373
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,490
significance to give you some

374
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:59,280
passes on site I'd love to see people
from this community making stuff and

375
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,149
bring it out there

376
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:03,770
we need wifi we need digital
communications

377
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:08,889
as a lot of what

378
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:12,510
ok all right or it may all trying to get
them to move it but

379
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,350
I'm I mean nobody there

380
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,270
II as the scenery is quite excellent
there in a

381
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,010
minded people were were naked a give
away all my old sun-bleached

382
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,780
dildos and people made the coolest
things other than this one guy made a

383
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,049
a bunny ears out a bit and more than for
the whole time so

384
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,620
there's the end with this is burning man
with a double rainbow there's the bus

385
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,240
some somewhere my work emits a photon
rubber chickens for quite a while

386
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,350
these are my ponies which at a respect
for Chris

387
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,520
Chris denied i did not bring on

388
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,929
they have motorized oscillating does on
the mini actually kinda gallup up and

389
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,649
down

390
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:57,190
now they've been uncovered up in several
states

391
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,690
on and that vibrator company is my
corporate sponsor now they send the

392
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,070
boxes and boxes and stuff

393
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,710
you come to my studio there's always
party favors intake homes

394
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,840
this is the video this is called
wallflower there's a

395
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,840
version other called pay flower outside

396
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,470
that you have to put quarters in to make
the liquid crystal obfuscation go away

397
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,799
how many people put a quarter in pay
flower anyone with the

398
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,039
out only to millionaires right it's not
you get a home in it

399
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,700
for a quarter I think it's a pretty good
deal this is a little dirty video that I

400
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,450
made but it

401
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:35,049
and has this floral motif I'm interested
in the food chain and

402
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,590
pollination ok dissemination I'm

403
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,760
and scaler symmetry which partly learned
about from reading computer stuff when

404
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,149
things are very similar on a small scale
to

405
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,790
the structure of things that are very
large seniors pay flower

406
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:53,000
does not but enigmatic don't you wanna
go put a quarter in

407
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,799
Kors a sketch from my PC at Burning Man
its what was going to be in a shipping

408
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,200
container with all these

409
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,399
solar flowers around it result all of
these works for solo the flower things

410
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,299
then I found this cool military trailer
that the base in 29 palms and need

411
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,119
anymore

412
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,480
a polished it is a much sharper and then
these are the hundreds

413
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,419
up and cast glass nipples with thousands
abilities

414
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,260
and then these these little collars are
made by defense contractor

415
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:23,000
this is a little slow out there right
now these are the

416
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,480
the anal beads ceiling fixtures and I'm
working on

417
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,710
on and here's a little a little

418
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:33,100
Photoshop but it's been a look like just
on the outside doesn't that make you

419
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,809
want to see the inside

420
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:39,000
it's gonna be a grotto love my creations
and then the scary video I've

421
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,760
it's called the grotto of Manifest
Destiny that the American Dream is the

422
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,369
theme this year

423
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:50,369

flowers the AV already seen the flowers

425
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,760

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,850
licensing the flowers good okay next up

427
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,919
I have James years and downstairs

428
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,379
on the bright side the the main floor he
has the

429
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:14,379
the spinning at least cultures

430
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:24,049
you need should be

431
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,860
alright thanks in um time Jim Sears and
I'm here is my father Ron sirs whose

432
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,270
sitting back by the sound booth there
and on

433
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,620
and we are presenting our pair

434
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,270
currently the person's vision
three-dimensional displays

435
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,460
the whole the whole process started with
through this image

436
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,110
on really inspired by the idea

437
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:08,130
blows through the significance this
image I think I for people suggest that

438
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,260
that this image actually started the the
environmental movement as we know it

439
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:12,679
today

440
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,090
was the the idea of having this
perspective that we were just on this

441
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,830
ball floating around in space is

442
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,159
is what kinda loudest to to sight to see

443
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,620
the the fragility in everything and you
know I'm certainly not the first person

444
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,870
to head to have this realization

445
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:32,700
their again standing on the shoulders of
giants this is a a sketch from

446
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,090
buckminster fuller done in 1962

447
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:39,250
about what he called the two years ago
which he envisioned as a 200 foot

448
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,000
diameter sphere covered with over a
million lights

449
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,410
at that time we've been like balls I had
to be suspended in the East River

450
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm in for India the United Nations to
to try to display information data

451
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,940
hope these world leaders make better
decisions and I think you know

452
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,049
we can all see that that's pretty
important so

453
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:02,870
inside the to start small this is %uh
this is our first

454
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,620
our first iteration it's a 12-inch
diameter 64 LED display

455
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,380
um wouldn't want to use a million lights
it's a lot of sirens we decide to use

456
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,929
persistent division instead

457
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,760
you can take this plexiglas ring spend
it

458
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,580
turns into a nice fear before lights on
the sphere than you end up with a

459
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,530
glowing sphere

460
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:28,418
people impolite to get pixels pixels you
can make patterns in the patterns you

461
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:29,370
can make images

462
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:36,370
and so here's a video this first one in
action

463
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,239
me

464
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:48,769
and so this is this is totally inspired
by you know the the people who come

465
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,639
before the

466
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:53,119
you know the Make Magazine people and
you will mourn the bicycle displays and

467
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:53,820
everything that

468
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,979
dump you'll be in in two dimensions and

469
00:28:56,979 --> 00:29:00,840
assertive spin on a different axes to
make to make three-dimensional display

470
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,389
and so so that was a big success for us
and we're really happy with how things

471
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:06,389
turned out but

472
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:09,869
its it's only 64 pixels high and it's
only a color so it's

473
00:29:09,869 --> 00:29:13,340
its it's a far cry from from this

474
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:16,889
it's a far cry from sorvino actually
show real information

475
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:20,009
so so we're we're constantly trying to
scale up

476
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:23,869
to get high resolution and more colored
absolute got downstairs is actually our

477
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:24,769
our latest

478
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:28,299
our latest iteration which is still

479
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:32,729
not quite finished actually serve this
is our second show evidence

480
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,309
it's definitely work in progress but we
stepped up answer microcontrollers now

481
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:36,979
reason

482
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:41,669
PGA's sixty there are 216 LED's hi

483
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:46,590
about 500 colors right now so we're
getting read a lot closer to

484
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:50,970
to the spot where were still still
definitely work in progress

485
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,989
arm but you can come see where it's at
right now dancers

486
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:59,499
in between those two pieces though we we
realize that

487
00:29:59,499 --> 00:30:02,739
we're doing surfaces fear which is great
but they're still

488
00:30:02,739 --> 00:30:06,679
there's a lot of volume within the
sphere that we work we weren't able to

489
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:07,539
visualize

490
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:12,129
and that you know are perception
adapters is a really interesting thing

491
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:13,109
to play with his

492
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:16,200
you know lesser brilliantly willingly
showed

493
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,659
so we realize that by spinning on two
axes

494
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:23,330
one sister and one we could actually
fill the entire volume of a sphere

495
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,019
with a relatively small number abilities

496
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:31,369
this is a early 3d rendering falter or
which is also downstairs

497
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:34,769
can see the %uh the cross is actually
thats models

498
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,649
about surface mount tricolor LED's
this'll apparatus

499
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:43,909
pins on on the horizontal axis and
simultaneously spins on a vertical axis

500
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:48,950
so that we start with this and rotated
is gonna second axis and actually no but

501
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,659
the spear

502
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:52,700
on the lot

503
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,960
love love physics involved in this that
we should learn as we went along

504
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,229
you know that turns out that the force
per session doesn't likes

505
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:04,339
doesn't like you to be a spinning things
on both axes once

506
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:07,779
Tom you know I'm sure you've all seen
through the gyroscope demonstrations or

507
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,749
try to hold a spinning bike will in turn
it once this is that kind of thing

508
00:31:11,749 --> 00:31:12,349
except

509
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:16,200
at 1000 rpm 300 rpm our first prototype

510
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,820
actually just exploded so as it turns
out we had to

511
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,479
will you go back to the drawing board
and we have

512
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:30,830
to actually two identical two identical
board soon in the commands and motors

513
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,830
can rotate in opposite directions
actually a technique that I searching

514
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,489
through

515
00:31:36,489 --> 00:31:40,759
searching through Google found area the
helicopter actually

516
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:45,820
helicopters often often operate this way
so that led to a lot more mechanical

517
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,549
complexity this really is more

518
00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:51,059
more mechanical project and then
electronica love this point earlier but

519
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:56,178
still a fair amount electronics on board
with no 16-bit microcontrollers 222

520
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,720
regularly the is and want to flash
memory

521
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:04,739
we spin we get flat readings discs
things like that

522
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:08,470
and has been in second axis yet
three-dimensional patterns

523
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,729
arm so

524
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:14,909
you know what's next we we

525
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:18,769
the invite mister displays are great but
I think in waterways its

526
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:23,039
it's a Campbell its

527
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,739
it's a very difficult way to go about
that problem I think you know in some

528
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:28,259
ways albert's got the the volumetric
thing

529
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:32,109
in a in a more practical way but we
really the surface displays are coming

530
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:33,229
we're focused right now

531
00:32:33,229 --> 00:32:37,460
only really we wanna go on to carry
through the visitors to scale

532
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,019
not just in terms resolution color depth
but invisible scale

533
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,359
actually try to bring fuller's bowlers
vision

534
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,759
22 reality to to actually have something
like this in

535
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:51,960
larger than human scale the people can
come and be influenced by

536
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,460
in CC happens to the world's in

537
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,059
and bring them in into three-dimensional
nature and

538
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:03,918
you noted to visualize something
rotating like that at 200 feet diameter

539
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:04,710
is

540
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,149
is certainly seems maybe a little crazy
and

541
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:12,589
it but I think you know there are people
that a lot going to myself that realize

542
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:14,970
that you know the first step to doing
anything is

543
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:21,220
imagine so we are happy to be here happy
to be inspired by love you and I know

544
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:28,220
we sure inspiration back so thanks very
much

545
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,820
k thank you on

546
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,399
next up we have John Montgomery and you
might have seen his

547
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,989
art at the other side at the top of the
stairs

548
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:50,989
you you

549
00:33:51,349 --> 00:33:57,499
any chance we could damn the spotlights
by like half

550
00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:04,499
that's fine things better

551
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:18,710
alright arm so my name is Sean
Montgomery and I'm currently finishing

552
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:21,040
up my PhD in neuroscience

553
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,149
and but I'm looking to get on the

554
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,839
the fast track our science and i'm
looking for an escape pod so

555
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,440
and thinking about how to combine art
science and technology answered if

556
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,500
create the future and that so if anybody
has any ideas I'm

557
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,570
and wide open on so today I'm gonna talk
about

558
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,070
Tom some apparel

559
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,850
that measures your body's responses
responsiveness

560
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,230
you most the time our bodies are
changing

561
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:53,649
on VAC all the time i's a change in
election on horses are traveling up and

562
00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:54,949
down our bodies and yet

563
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,029
everything around us is kinda dead are
closer dad our stuff

564
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,180
are are objects are dead so there's a
disconnect between our fashion design

565
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,410
and and us as individuals I wanna try to
bring

566
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,460
some of that dynamic schism love our
bodies

567
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,160
and use that to on on our clothing

568
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,109
and in our possessions to express arm

569
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:21,060
ourselves and to create new
opportunities for communication

570
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:25,609
so the first thing I'm gonna talk about
is

571
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:29,840
if you guys can see it with the lights
is something I've affectionately

572
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,420
entitled my my heart on so

573
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:37,859
what this is doing is this is actually
measuring

574
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:42,560
my DKG and displaying it as positive
light sorry to my heart beats

575
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,540
my my shirt is beating with it and its
it's a lot of fun wearing around because

576
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,570
you realize mom how much your heartbeat
is changing

577
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,660
during social interactions and how

578
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,640
often we ignore that as our hearts we
have meters away our life

579
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,140
and it also gives you a sense up the
electricity

580
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,710
on running through us that keeps us
alive

581
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,450
om and I think there are

582
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:13,419
a lot of future directions for this type
of thing

583
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,690
com I think building it into shirts more
right now of course American from these

584
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,060
these pads Tom and using

585
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,119
off-the-shelf wireless technology to
build projected original send the signal

586
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:27,770
to

587
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,940
hats or shoes or whatever you want on

588
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,350
and I think most importantly to you

589
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,890
to to get in the networking with these
sorts of things imagine if

590
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:41,319
much people ran these and local area
network San you know you could trade

591
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,170
heart beats for somebody could have
multiple people's heart beats UK

592
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,300
collective heart beats on in large
groups or you can map them on Google

593
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,830
Maps

594
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:52,400
you could do all sorts of interesting
things I think with networking your

595
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,600
biological signals

596
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:57,210
om so the next thing I want to talk
about

597
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,470
is something I'm affectionately called
on my truth

598
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,960
and so what this is doing

599
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,410
this is measuring my governor skin
response which is a common measure of

600
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,899
emotional responsiveness used in lie
detector tests and other things

601
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,040
so I may be kinda maxed out right now

602
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,640
but me see if I smacked myself really
hard yeah I'm gonna

603
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,549
I'm I'm kind of reaching the limit here
on giving a tough

604
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,840
on so arms I actually brought

605
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:30,650
a video of my brother mom did to display
what it does

606
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,150
see if we can hear it boo

607
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:39,600
you your

608
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:43,089
the trip going

609
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:47,570
will

610
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:53,650
wassup very well not want work

611
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:57,140
alright om well so I have an
installation

612
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,600
downstairs on that where you can come in
you can measure your heartbeat

613
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,410
and you guys can come try on the truth
wristband and see

614
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,040
I mean really responds well home it's
kind of amazing

615
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,570
when you're not you know giving a talk
you can see I

616
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,920
i think im also surrounded by electrical
noise which which

617
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,230
may be an issue also I'm so there's

618
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:24,430
a lot of min sorta future directions

619
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,960
for the search thing actually sorry I
missed one thing I'm so as well

620
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,690
say you know how much fun as to where it
outside I've worn out a lot

621
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:35,230
and I'm you know you go out to a party

622
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,410
and people wanna try it on and the pass
around and they try to you know figure

623
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,460
out how they can get a rise over each
other

624
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:44,570
actually had I was at a bar the other
night

625
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:48,370
and this girl came up to me and Mike
grab my package

626
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:51,390
I'm yeah its

627
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:55,629
was kinda exciting yeah and a

628
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,910
so um and I have a friend who's here

629
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:02,420
studies tai chi and he can actually
light up on command

630
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,480
and and I i've learned actually a lot
about my friends

631
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,640
from them wearing it I have learned some
my friends really sensitive

632
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,330
to other people and some people you know
its particular types of things that are

633
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,440
sensitive about

634
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,810
so it's a lot of fun and it really
exposes you know you

635
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,200
as an individual and allows you to
communicate in new ways

636
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,930
arm so the future directions on this um

637
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,399
I'm you know basically I think I recall
the take this next level it's not like

638
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,030
these ideas are really

639
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:33,250
all that radically new i mean these
biofeedback spin around since the

640
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,750
fifties and sixties

641
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,050
I'm by where is the stuff you know
moving sucks they don't do anything

642
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,420
on so you know I think it's great I
think people

643
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,320
you know I think there would be they
were im a divide people I think some

644
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
people do I i

645
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,680
can't handle the truth but I think a lot
of people would like to

646
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:53,009
you know be involved so if anybody out
there like two engineers

647
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:57,700
marketers I know whatever um so there's
lots of other cool possibilities to with

648
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,560
networking

649
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,980
Tom for example there's there's a web
page I just became aware of online

650
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,340
he handed this this guy or girl I don't
even know on handed out

651
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,070
these devices um something similar to
this the measures ago

652
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,340
governing skin response with your G

653
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,970
GPS and then you can mak connects get
responses he can see at this busy

654
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,120
traffic crossing the site there is a

655
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,690
spatially a peak in the governing skin
response which is kind of interesting

656
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,690
I'm so I think there's lots of other
possibilities you could have

657
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,230
on in its interface is very easily over
the Internet

658
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,380
you could have your your text color
changing

659
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,870
as you as it as you get excited about
this is that

660
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,920
on you can communicate with the robot
pets

661
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,830
on I i really think the sky is the limit
here

662
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:52,970
on so the last thing I wanna talk about

663
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,220
is a I've called my thinking cap

664
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,540
is it on against excellent um

665
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,580
and so this is standing on my background
in neuroscience

666
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,279
um and basically what it's doing is it's
measuring

667
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,359
the electrical potentials generated by
coalitions have neurons in my brain

668
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:13,890
and then projecting that on RGB light a
race

669
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,930
and there's a there's a lot of
information there and I'm just parsing

670
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,250
and very simple way

671
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:23,040
on but to give you some sense of scale
there are about a 100 billion neurons

672
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,330
inside each of your head um

673
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:30,759
and thats way more star as stars and you
can see on a clear night sky

674
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,180
not even in new york like in montana and
these neurons have comp anyways

675
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,640
interacting and so beginning to
understand that and use that to

676
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,839
communicate

677
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,160
you know in person over networks using
them to control

678
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,420
your mouse and things like that i think
is one possibility

679
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,670
so from that's pretty much all I had

680
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,470
talk about oh yeah this was our a little
display have basically so that's

681
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,680
these are brain waves here on the top
that's the Rossing on then you can do

682
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,850
spectral analysis

683
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:02,569
now says which is what I'm doing here
and that's the color signal here

684
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:05,850
and that's what is what happens if you
close your eyes open your eyes things

685
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:07,040
like that

686
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,320
um to those in different signals on
majoring in projecting here

687
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,580
annex one-a give thanks to you so my
friends my friends too funny

688
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,740
helped me a lot to this project his this
process

689
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,800
and turn on my website send me an email

690
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,150
Minister heard you guys think come see
me at the my installation

691
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,540
you can check out your heart be I'm so

692
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:35,540
thanks a lot

693
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,670
k thanks very much we have a bowel 10
minutes available for

694
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,080
questions on anybody wants to ask
question Mike from

695
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,600
to run a tight home

696
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,850
these are scary sorry um I just wanted
to make a guess I

697
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,770
quick comment and thank you guys a lot
for your inspiration what your

698
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,710
really showcasing here um I've been
studying a lot of sociology in

699
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,150
and art technology in my classes legally

700
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:10,790
and it's really interesting to see how
the more we get back to realizing that

701
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:12,390
technology is a subset

702
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:16,529
are and seeing how those implications
affect arrest us and seeing how that

703
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,060
affects

704
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:24,060
innovation and I just want to thank you
guys for being so inspire

705
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:27,780
think on a

706
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:32,120
anyone else no

707
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,850
on great I guess we'll

708
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:39,710
0 want arm

709
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,130
we have

710
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,700
we have about 10 minutes if you wanna

711
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,130
yeah yep

712
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:51,530
no question yes

713
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,500
things for Randy I'm how to

714
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,780
of course start the toy thing where did
that come from

715
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,690
too I think the sex tourists like worry

716
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:08,240
getting involved in that I mean own lots
of that too much to ask

717
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,650
i think im for the in the services

718
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,619
love kinda reversing things those but
thank you for started making things out

719
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:18,260
have fun

720
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,780
and have condoms which John in the
eighties condoms

721
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,000
world all over because first people
which is carrying on and throwing

722
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,270
condoms everywhere and then

723
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:30,570
with it each crisis began did became
another kinda powerful

724
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:33,710
potent image sister is making all these
female

725
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,270
under like things are mostly didn't show
them both those

726
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:41,009
the one motorist piece for the areas had
have the money on

727
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,230
and then that eventually turned into
these

728
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:47,530
flower forms and then it just became
really obvious I was going down seventh

729
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,130
Avenue Indian walked into the pleasure
Chester somewhere

730
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,690
I'll two stools and stamens and answers

731
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,060
and their own like if you buy a
double-ended eighteen-inch when you can

732
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:57,310
get

733
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:00,470
to for twelve dollars now

734
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:07,470
now I'm a wholesaler yeah I have a
question sandy

735
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:11,450
arm so where did you exit your work size

736
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:15,330
this conference actually for just a few
more days

737
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:21,060
I have some work up that Morgan Lee Min
gallery I'm its 29th or 30th Street I'm

738
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,580
10th Avenue on right on 10th Avenue in
the you can see must have been in the

739
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:25,060
window

740
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,770
on exhibited in California quite a bit

741
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,580
different called college shows think my
biggest thing ever will be this

742
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,529
monumental

743
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:37,760
installation to bring him in the summer
and I

744
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,830
have stuff to clean the web in your
you're in there

745
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:44,560
New York to like new york is in my hot
spot but I'm working on that

746
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,049
you can see my work it at Palumbo dot
com my last name polu inbio

747
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,390
if you wanna see what's going on I have
a little blog current things and then a

748
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:53,859
while

749
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:57,170
flash site order things with my friends
made its amazing

750
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:02,580
thank you and is there any references
your

751
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,009
arm deal to work because

752
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:11,369
I'm sorry I just going to counter tile
how is there any references that to the

753
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,540
conference or you just

754
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,349
decided to shock like I'm you were to
see by

755
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:21,640
to shop well they left the door open and
I got in actually

756
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,180
you mean specifically that

757
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:29,980
million create those specifically for
hope I've been doing those

758
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,660
kind of things but things in that family
for years in that dildo work for a

759
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,868
specifically for a couple years in its
when I pics to show here because I

760
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:39,310
thought

761
00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:43,589
this is kinda like a garden I love the
young minds

762
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:47,380
blossoming Imran amid the technology
it's a fertile

763
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:54,380
atmosphere thanks I

764
00:46:56,869 --> 00:47:00,369
hi I have two questions um siphon funds
on the names

765
00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:03,770
click here for the the one who is
showing of the spinning

766
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:08,220
images in the sphere as curious have you
ever tried to put by moving

767
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,140
what seems that the globe was kinda
moving average guy doing like video or

768
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,009
moving pictures on that having an
experimentation with

769
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,880
I yeah actually the the the one that's
down the right now

770
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,000
were we're working on some
synchronization issues but sorta in the

771
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,980
in the shop at home I have I have done
some animation work on it and

772
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,150
it's on yes the goal is to be totally
capable of

773
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:35,910
you know full frame animation video so
that's

774
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:40,210
is a really important thing for you know
for

775
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,540
for doing data visualizations to be a
live video arm

776
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:48,070
the the first phase will be sorta
pre-recorded video and eventually

777
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,349
you know live plugin HDMI cable and you

778
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:55,000
you know like a ok Fremantle TV cool

779
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,000
and my second questions to the awesome
biofeedback

780
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,250
I am is releasing everyone here is very
interesting and

781
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:07,490
impressed with just a really great job
as it says that as

782
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:11,050
heard a lot of interesting thing about
biofeedback system captures the thick

783
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:11,890
one day that

784
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,930
the same way they have like a weather
report now add report that there might

785
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,629
be some sort of like mood report

786
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:20,940
like different parts of the city I Q no
today new york city is happy today

787
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:24,589
I their his I've heard interests and I'm
curious

788
00:48:24,589 --> 00:48:28,570
I thing

789
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,780
I think I think we're gonna start using
the signals a lot more for a lot of

790
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,380
different things and I think

791
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,300
that collective behaviors that that are
gonna emerge out of that

792
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:40,760
is is one the most interesting parts

793
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,500
and I think you know both in in terms of
utility

794
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,790
like something you're suggesting with
you know

795
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:53,089
weather report for our moods mom but
also I think in terms of

796
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:56,950
art and and bringing art into new forms
in your house

797
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,180
so you could have interactive
biofeedback Park on your wall

798
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,299
that communicates with your friends Mar
on his wall or her goal

799
00:49:04,299 --> 00:49:07,799
or your family or larger networks that
new collective behavior

800
00:49:07,799 --> 00:49:11,410
so I think there's a lot of
possibilities for that sort of thing

801
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:16,029
and we'll see will you know I think
we'll start to get a sense for

802
00:49:16,029 --> 00:49:19,869
what's going to be really useful and
what's what's going to be

803
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:24,289
for for fun as as we start to use these
things more in

804
00:49:24,289 --> 00:49:29,230
and wear them on our bodies so that we
get a sense for what

805
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:32,730
they really mean and how they react it a

806
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,499
just once they really like I cuz I am
thankful that you came to hope because

807
00:49:36,499 --> 00:49:38,049
you had a lot to the forces

808
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:43,788
good job here one more question

809
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:46,920
and then we'll wrap it up yeah question
for R&D if

810
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:51,779
have you heard a company called a bipod
they make vibrators interface with iPods

811
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:55,440

the beats

812
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,579
