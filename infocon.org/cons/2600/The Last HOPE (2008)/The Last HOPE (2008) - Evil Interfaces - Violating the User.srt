1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,330
health

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,370
okay

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:10,370
thing

4
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,190
okay before we get started to have some
administrative announcements

5
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,620
suck a sign up for the

6
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,320
fourth track in Zeus and at 2 p.m.
there'll be

7
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,790
relationship packing whose use please
set your cell phones to vibrate

8
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:11,640
or of there's lots to see and do

9
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,420
in the pavilion mess cuz that's on the
second floor DVD sales have all talks in

10
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,280
vendor area

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,010
on the 8th 84 so that's my hope
contribution

12
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:32,010
to let's get rid of our little dancer
friend here

13
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,080
okay

14
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,280
I i'm craig conti and pope to do

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,670
the several things with this talk one is
to raise awareness

16
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,880
about how r some I'm sure where some
obvious ways were

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,780
manipulated using interfaces both of on
and off the desktop

18
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,320
but also to just kind of cover cover the
range to

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,470
get your feet get some feedback risk us
a little bit about what countermeasures

20
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,820
exists in what countermeasures don't
exist

21
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,110
I think the idea of attacking the user
through the interface is actually very

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,210
hard problem

23
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,770
when you're there when you're fighting
the designer we're going to look at

24
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,900
arm basically a catalog

25
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,610
love evil usability so different
different categories of ways people have

26
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,550
been using to tax

27
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,130
the user and I guess from tax
perspective the ideas

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,170
from the defenders perspective there are
things to help counter

29
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,080
in also look at ways to measure

30
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,130
evil usability so you've got this how
evil is a given interface

31
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:44,130
so get some ideas and some feedback from
that so with that

32
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,550
so I'm here as a free citizen I'm not
yours representative any

33
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,920
employer mime or the United States
government so

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,769
for those view that have studied
interface design their filled with great

35
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:02,650
Greek ideals about how to protect the
user how to help the user public schools

36
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,340
minimize errors army interfaces are easy
to learn satisfying to use things like

37
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:07,940
that

38
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:12,480
but there's a whole subclasses interface
designers have basically do the exact

39
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,060
opposite

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,550
if you go line by line and due to the
inverse

41
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,440
and this is this is a sample of the good
interface

42
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,690
are came out at MIT Media Lab chat
circles

43
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,870
and basically I the interface design
community you

44
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,140
come up with these guidelines come up
these two procedures techniques

45
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,280
to make better our faces what happens
our people are

46
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,120
are doing the opposite in tackling
attacking us all I'm sure we've all

47
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,810
encountered

48
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,320
people and faces so just to kind of draw
a line around what it would I'm defining

49
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,620
as an evil interface

50
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,739
it's something that's deliberately
malicious so

51
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,079
its sub designed to trick the user
mislead user

52
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,109
and axe counter to the goals what you

53
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,500
as the user are trying to accomplish and

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,519
you're fighting against the goals of the
designer so there's this

55
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,940
adversarial interface design that's
that's going on

56
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,440
im excluding the idea in your

57
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,150
your ideas of what bad design is will
vary but I chose a couple personal

58
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,820
favorites

59
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,639
I'm hipster dance and the rotating
skulls

60
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,650
so those are my personal ones so I'm not
saying that evil interface design

61
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,080
is what some people call bad design
there has to be more licious intent

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,550
so did in its is an evolving problem
units that occurs

63
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,940
on of the desktop the most recently and
we've seen in the web it's everyday its

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,650
interface

65
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,830
started off with with pop-ups but pretty
good countermeasures came to play there

66
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,020
but its is an evolving problem and as I
went out to

67
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,500
trying catalog the different techniques
people used it went from

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,970
just a few the small number of cattle
categories basically into an

69
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,040
encyclopedia

70
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,690
evil usability basically any way we can
be manipulated the people thought I love

71
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,030
they're doing so it's this extended
extended techniques and I

72
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,360
in his new usability rules art cut
developed I bet people will the Virgo

73
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,770
and convert those rules and use them to
you

74
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,120
attacked the user so why

75
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,150
why are people doing that's what are the
motivators up the attacker now call the

76
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:16,889
attacker the

77
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:21,320
the interface designer well almost
becomes tender profit either a media

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,919
profit

79
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,849
or some sheen events that leads to
profit I'm

80
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:30,960
you're making sales tracking PR a lot of
it revolves around advertising at least

81
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,620
on the web

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,020
ISA to gas station involves buying
premium gas instead the less expensive

83
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,840
gas

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,500
but there are also other legal
implications such as helping protect

85
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,460
your intellectual property

86
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,090
or I'm if any view the counter goat see

87
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,480
on the web I'm basically that

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,540
a you call that a sense of humor I i've
sorts

89
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,630
a know when I don't think I'm strictly
profiting of that financially

90
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,050
and the only hope

91
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,440
good lord yes I'm and also as we go
through this year

92
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,520
your definition of evil may vary if
you're a shareware program a

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,849
arm if in you what's users to register
your product for something like that

94
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,890
your employees will interface techniques
I'm not assaulting your

95
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,650
underlying you know Niederauer necessity
to make a profit

96
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,850
but the idea of the form or adversary
earlier faces on it is when you are your

97
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:27,760
goals are counter to that the user these
want something for free

98
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,880
you wanna live so buddy what's your
definition of evil may vary

99
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,170
so the attackers problem in this case in
particularly in the context of the web

100
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,880
is that users are paying attention
advertisements

101
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,020
I in and that's that's at one end of the
spectrum people are paying attention

102
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,219
and at the other end of the spectrum and
I've got a report link to this article

103
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,380
it's kind of interesting

104
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,500
the generation myspace is getting fed up
that is just rude

105
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,610
representative of people are paying
attention on one hand

106
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,240
and on the other hand they were only
tolerate so much aggressive

107
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,850
interface design before the move on to
someone else

108
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,240
so you there operating in between those
two bath boundaries

109
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,750
and when I say users are paying
attention advertisement some people the

110
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,230
interface design world

111
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,540
have used the term banner ad blindness
that people are

112
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,670
are becoming desensitized to

113
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,330
are to advertisements and here's a
here's an example

114
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,960
and this comes from use that dot com

115
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,090
so to web page and using I tracking
software there's a heat map so were

116
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,410
people are looking

117
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,600
at the website its it's hot it's rad

118
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,680
so that's the content that's the goal
typically love

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,120
abusers is there they're looking what
they want to look at

120
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,500
and the two advertisements are cool
they're not looking to do not even

121
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,150
seeing

122
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,400
advertisements so in in the context this
problem with that is forcing people's

123
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:58,170
to do the interfaces are should become
more and more aggressive

124
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:02,070
sewed this is a broad problem mean has
everyone I mean I could say that every

125
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:04,610
who the room is encountered evil
interfaces

126
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,690
not think pretty much you all have
who've you

127
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,760
at who spent four whose encountered
interfaces

128
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,180
so annoying that they just stopped using
a particular product service or website

129
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,480
im pretty much everybody being driven
away to somewhere else

130
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,300
so and I what about the countermeasures
you implement some people use

131
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,440
tools like grease monkey which uses
snippets have JavaScript to alter pages

132
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,940
because you can control its in your
browser grease monkey loves you do that

133
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,500
orders at blocking software pop-up
blockers arm

134
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,950
thats that type of thing provoca see
your can do things like

135
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:44,730
change in animated gif to a anonymous
just on the floor give on the fly

136
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,420
how effective are those and you do you
think the really effective for how much

137
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,689
like sale

138
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:53,029
um you think sir they're really

139
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,070
solid in your protective

140
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,200
K who thinks they're OK about fifty
fifty other kinda the so-so

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,620
okay thanks because poor this is getting
feedback on

142
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,829
on what what everybody's they can
receive just

143
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:11,260
to help define the boundaries the
problem I my take is that this is a hard

144
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,100
problem

145
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,180
because people are very creative and
every time it's extremely difficult to

146
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,670
computationally

147
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,880
are algorithmically dictate boundaries
around

148
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,329
certain types of content that it that
you can filter from what you see

149
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:28,970
and i also argue that the more where you
are the the better

150
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,850
your to speak for the more subtle tax
the the better defend

151
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,510
be the better defensive mechanism you
have

152
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,959
although you get me get more angry more
quickly that's the downside

153
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,029
so we would cover little background I am
just looking at the %uh the cut the

154
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,639
threat model number detector motivations
which were in the middle of now

155
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,610
and then this taxonomy if evil usability
and then measuring evil

156
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,850
was really where we're going with the
talk

157
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,410
so the attacker is the designer the
interface

158
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,170
up but they don't have to be okay they
don't have to be the primary designer

159
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,099
because they're certain examples

160
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,440
that it's a third party other than the
the primary content designer

161
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,470
that actually the committee if they can
influence interface that the attacker

162
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,100
so we've seen that I have screenshot
later in the talk about ISP's

163
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,550
eyes peas have at the start are testing
the waters in

164
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,890
in manipulating data flows that come to
your computer

165
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,020
and with that inserting advertising and
white

166
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,970
and also the people outsource their
advertising so produced by the nature

167
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,200
above signing up for given advertising
network inserts information into our

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,090
normally

169
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:42,740
agreeable interface in in what you're
trying to protect II

170
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,160
I believer your your time your attention
your money

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,520
are the primary primary assets were
trying to protect but we see this

172
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,540
everywhere it's not just the web thing

173
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,740
its gas stations we r

174
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,110
I have some screenshots will talk to
them a second casinos are all about that

175
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,690
Crean varmints a separate you from your
money

176
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,230
grocery stores for software hardware the
web it's really everywhere

177
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,760
and okay on the web you mike got them
from influence information flow because

178
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,580
it's displayed in your browser new
control that

179
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,220
but other places you just can't mmm it's
a hard problem

180
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,140
so like I was saying when I tried to
start great gathering snapshots examples

181
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,720
of this is just our growing

182
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,880
been growing in growing group from a
taxonomy to this

183
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,210
really encyclopedia so would have done
break your stride

184
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:32,160
to cover some in the larger categories
that in some entertaining examples I

185
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,410
hope

186
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:38,650
I and a.m. in to show you get your get
your thoughts on them

187
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,819
but the if you look at these are all
about attacking the human

188
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,930
attacking the end-user so attracting
there to the road

189
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:48,850
attacking their attention exploiting
their heirs making them work tricking

190
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,610
them

191
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,839
are manipulating their navigation either

192
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,140
overtly or covertly and all the same
thing with middling interface controls

193
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,510
in when you think about attention
there's there's a spectrum love

194
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,900
a minimal ways to track someone's
attention all the way up to

195
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,460
very regis ways love attracting
someone's tension just using a slightly

196
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,330
darker

197
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,110
color on top love the slightly contrast
and color will draw some once I

198
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,960
all the way up to your move up to the
blink tag briefings blinking at you it's

199
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,930
hard to ignore

200
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,710
and then we've got some really
interesting examples in a moment

201
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,880
in what attention attacks really come
down to use the

202
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,540
or is it is closely tied to the idea
pretend to processing

203
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,219
and fruit and a processing is is

204
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,690
how and how your brain deals with
certain types of input before

205
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:44,720
the without conscious thought so this
happens in like 250 milliseconds or less

206
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,130
about certain things just pop out you
don't have to think about the Red Square

207
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:48,550
in

208
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,680
Iran so the red circle in the picture
you just see

209
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,320
the red the though wat square meets the
sea of circles

210
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,339
you just see and those the typeof things
that

211
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,960
the a while for affective attention
attacks

212
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,860
but it's not limited to to just those
urs have a list or up on the screen

213
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:12,380
it the idea those your before they're
even conscious part because people see

214
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,089
these things

215
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:16,740
we've just been bred to to deal with way

216
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,130
so distorted the low end is this a color
we have

217
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:25,600
did the obvious obvious things the low
less less aggressive side of things

218
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,920
you see it's interesting this is that as
you go to different gas stations take a

219
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,690
look at how the pumps are designed

220
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,040
has anyone ever ordered a car wash
without

221
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,649
are without actually 11 because if I try
asking for mercy

222
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:41,640
I don't know II don't know who's
encountered that being asked if they

223
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,550
want a car wash

224
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,350
II II was once in a gas station and
someone came in really really angry

225
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,470
and went up there and so I or the
carwash I don't want a car wash

226
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,550
and that the gas station attendant was
time you have a car wash

227
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,580
so is pretty interesting story about
that that's part of it gas station pumps

228
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,279
a lot of thought goes into you

229
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,310
%uh suffering you for money

230
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:05,190
and the take a look at how premium is
displayed in in context

231
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,920
the in context where you pay and what
colors are used I'd say this one

232
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,360
uses regular with red more likely to
draw your attention so it I would say

233
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,740
it's

234
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,640
it's not particularly evil other than
any time after the Giants I'm

235
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,260
the tells you where to start that's a
bad sign

236
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:27,569
I'm you the the idea of that how your
high flows across the page

237
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,670
that's with in this example the content
they put the have great in line

238
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,070
with the content so you is in the I'm to
clean the Western world people

239
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:40,000
read from left to right and they're
trying to do that so they'll they'll be

240
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,850
forced to read advertisement probably
without even thinking

241
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,060
the idea crowding out content indicate
that I have some great examples later on

242
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,690
about how

243
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,149
credit how crowded out contact can get
but just in this example there's your

244
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:54,980
content

245
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,029
and its bracketed with advertisements

246
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:02,060
them another is

247
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,520
the the video are audit the auto playing
a video sometimes with

248
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,890
a with audio track alongside

249
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,899
and this is mister fisher and that's
nice thing about talks like this you can

250
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,490
get up there just

251
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,830
no piss people off I guess but mister
fisher here just immediately starts

252
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,690
talking to you about investments were
all I want to do is read the story about

253
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,529
Google

254
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:25,899
are developing an iTunes a competitor

255
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,459
notes mister fisher the idea of

256
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:33,290
motion in shitter in it you know the
size type from animation your

257
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:37,060
your body the the human being has
evolved to

258
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:44,060
to detect motion and it's it's basically
extremely difficult to ignore

259
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,760
your

260
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:05,690
so so what we're doing at them were more

261
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,370
non content that's being crowded onto
page the harder and harder it is to

262
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,010
actually try and accomplish

263
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,240
with what your end goal is to read the
news story in there so much singing and

264
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,260
dancing going on

265
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,520
and that percentage sadly have content
to

266
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:26,520
non content is is declining

267
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,550
so the hover add those things that go
flying around on top of your page

268
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,020
who's who's encountered those yes who
likes this

269
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,480
yeah

270
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,370
that in this one them slow starts on my
favorite sites and outcomes as jim is

271
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,350
doing a split right on top of the news
story I was trying to read

272
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,209
bouncing up and down for quite a while
in another

273
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,980
arm a it wasn't I was trying to get the
weather from a new site

274
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,470
and outcomes a person come walking
against the norm ice cream the persons

275
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,390
about this big

276
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:16,550
on my screen trying to sell me a Toyota
Highlander not talking to me

277
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,419
in its it's incredibly and I but again
this is moving up that spectrum

278
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:27,420
upheaval and it's not just

279
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,620
I slated to single animations on a page

280
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,120
sometimes they'll have more and more in
this is from The Weather Channel

281
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,170
no I want to do was watch the weather
and I had this

282
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,760
dispersant dancing to be getting so all
I want to do is look at the weather

283
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,379
but when you go to page you see to
dancing people on it

284
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:50,550
it is very hard just to quickly look at
the weather but that and and I have I

285
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,510
think part of this is overtime is

286
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,410
is pp if you visit the site a lot i per
person befriended checks the weather

287
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:56,980
what

288
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,930
for whatever reason and he told me he
doesn't really see these dancing

289
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,020
dancing women anymore firstly really
norodom now he knows where to look

290
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:11,550
so

291
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,540
outside hover advertisements this is one
of the most egregious

292
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:19,379
rectangular type advertisements i've
seen that fixed position

293
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:25,310
advertisements its from from net sweet
and you can see it's pretty large size

294
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,889
relation to the content because we think
of the above the fold what's actually

295
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,350
presented in the browser

296
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,640
this about equals the content you're
trying to view tell me

297
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,640
if you can if you could read the story
while this is going on

298
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:58,590
anyone

299
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,799
so the inverse attracting attention is
sometimes the interface designer wants

300
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,080
to avoid attention for a variety of
reasons

301
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,499
so one approach this is the Google
approach

302
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:24,639
is to make the advertisements arguably
subtle

303
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:28,789
I'm compared to the spinning head this
is this is sort of good

304
00:19:28,789 --> 00:19:31,969
but less they anger users too much

305
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:35,469
and what's interesting about the web
these days is people sites like you can

306
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:36,359
run experiments

307
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,218
they can try web sites and optimize you
know say I'm

308
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:44,200
with the def the the contest different
types of techniques

309
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,539
see which ones more effective and have a
survival of the fittest approach

310
00:19:47,539 --> 00:19:53,509
so that then I'm told that they do you
do that no other approaches

311
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,659
when you don't want people to see
something but you have to have it there

312
00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:57,739
for legal reasons

313
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:01,519
for example the

314
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,899
privacy policy have tax cut they have a
bottom of the side

315
00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:09,460
when people are going to gravitate
toward the %uh the next button which is

316
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,469
set by default

317
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:14,070
another's ever ever-popular you look

318
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,070
and if you look at this time it extra
window

319
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,189
little tiny window opens up to 10 full
text full pages

320
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,389
love have content above but there you
are

321
00:20:26,389 --> 00:20:30,379
so we've had this come spectrum

322
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:33,909
attracting attention and the opposite
avoiding attention

323
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:36,979
now this is weird just force yourself
that's impossible

324
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:40,309
I know the spinning heads pretty much
impossible to ignore so these actually

325
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:40,908
stop

326
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:45,109
flow on So You to you interact said

327
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:48,489
ewbal encountered whose encountered
annoying random updates from their

328
00:20:48,489 --> 00:20:49,249
software

329
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,049
I again it's getting your attention and

330
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:56,908
it sits there on your desktop and I'm
not talking about my favorite

331
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:00,859
Microsoft to ask if you were you you
have unused icons on your desktop

332
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,449
a I'm not talking about that they I
don't think they're doing that too

333
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,820
try and sell you something or for some
product they're trying to be helpful

334
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,189
but but many software packages that
we've just

335
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:15,070
at inform your updates often to just get
your attention

336
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,269
think about their product may be
operated a

337
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,379
oftentimes you'll see it on web sites

338
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:26,849
to Justin example taking a survey
Network World

339
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:30,099
you the show you the content they tease
you the contact trying to get but in the

340
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:31,950
background they value my opinion

341
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,309
and want me to take a server and the
ever-popular

342
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:41,149
interstitial advertisement the splash
screen this one at least gives you

343
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:41,899
controls

344
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:45,460
and a time you know tells usurp your
time and gives you control the exhibit

345
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,359
you you spending time trying to find
that some do not

346
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:51,418
I the

347
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:54,580
FBI warning oftentimes you can skip over
this

348
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,129
most people people found ways by
dripping out of the CD

349
00:21:58,129 --> 00:22:02,009
altogether and there's some interesting
vary in severity solve this by the way

350
00:22:02,009 --> 00:22:03,070
on the web the for

351
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:08,489
looking to be entertained and I think
this is another interesting attack

352
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:15,489
the idea of exploiting errors so

353
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:20,099
we make mistakes good interfaces are
supposed to help us avoid errors

354
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:24,908
easily recover from errors what people
to evil interface designers they find

355
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,339
out what mistakes are likely

356
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:30,700
and then use that to their advantage so
here's an example

357
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,419
from Yahoo movies what would you like to
have happen when you

358
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,570
type in a mistype removing would you
like to see a list of movies with a

359
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,439
similar name

360
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,809
are you like to stare despite animated
blowfish expanding and contracting

361
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:47,849
well I'll tell you that ya who made the
decision to go with the spiked animated

362
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:48,649
blowfish

363
00:22:48,649 --> 00:22:52,320
and it is the damage caused

364
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,970
in contrast though to

365
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,039
say a Google approach in this this
example night I was searching for cat

366
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,249
aka I spelled that wrong

367
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:04,749
and immediately brought me one told me
the correct spelling

368
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:11,749
in by it was able to find the right link
regardless another

369
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,749
is the idea pics exploiting capture
superior so for people who were in the

370
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:18,669
usability it's interesting to go to

371
00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:22,950
just known error type: search those
lists and usability test tax

372
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,859
types as bearers one that I found
interesting was the idea to capture

373
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:31,019
so it's a type affair where you have
this more practice behavior

374
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,710
that takes kinda overrides what you thus
less familiar behavior you need

375
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,349
so I just want to look up a word on
Dictionary dot com

376
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:42,519
and what pops up is that

377
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:45,639
right where I left inside the Scream
read by in

378
00:23:45,639 --> 00:23:49,039
blinking cursor and to me that's

379
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,779
you type in the word you want to look up
well that's actually an ad for the

380
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,329
Visual Thesaurus

381
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:57,059
and you have to go appear and go with
searchlight I'd wonder how many people

382
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:00,889
make that mistake

383
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:05,429
another is the mistype sure I'll in this
gets back to

384
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,649
other people who contribute for your
interface so if you mistyped the URL

385
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,899
I I don't particularly want Roadrunner
Records

386
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:18,669
giving me I'm what one are just I just
thus arbitrarily

387
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,960
the I don't why I didn't was searching
for the letter typed in

388
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,629
at the last hope misspoke misspelled it
and the kindly caught it

389
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:31,309
and give me a list I love a with some
sponsored advertisements for my

390
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,289
from my mistake

391
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:38,929
also the idea of sometimes you click on
a page to give it focus

392
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:42,389
and rather than just making the
hyperlinks here the advertisements or

393
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,279
even this red bounded region

394
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:47,869
people expect expand into larger white
space hot spots

395
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:51,319
trying to catch misplaced clicks

396
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:56,428
another technique making the user work

397
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:00,599
usually the world in these examples
there some goals from the designers

398
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:02,329
trying to push you in some direction

399
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:06,759
usually getting a premium account paying
for otherwise they're gonna make you pay

400
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:10,309
in another way here you have to wait

401
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:14,479
that your your download ticket will is
reserved you have to wait point two

402
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:15,460
minutes

403
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,229
before the download will be ready unless
you want to sign up for a premium

404
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:20,519
account

405
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:25,089
they even tell you how much cream counts
are

406
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:28,799
this one if you're not a premium user
they make you completely capture

407
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,379
I'm in this is pretty much with our
captures

408
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:36,979
her arm these basically designed to make
people work term humans are humans and

409
00:25:36,979 --> 00:25:38,399
not computers

410
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:42,239
I this when you have to tell cats from
dogs so quickly

411
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:45,809
who can tell me the three the four
letters

412
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:52,809
that have the dog on for the cap before
voters they have the cap

413
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:05,660
so as best I can tell its the its

414
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,690
3 TV GW

415
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,700
3 TGW but thats work that's a pickup in
the ass actually and

416
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,380
we do that enough to people they're not
going to them if they may consider doing

417
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,260
premium account another's the time

418
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,950
honored the trash around and its kinda
relates back to to doing work

419
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,510
but this is just a tiny example love
some degree just things we've all

420
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,820
encountered in the past

421
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,370
I did %uh in iTunes update and I didn't
want fucked up to a quick time

422
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,040
well did anyway not did not only do it
putting a

423
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,770
piece of trash from my desktop if you
open Wired Magazine

424
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:47,090
or any manner any magazine wired tends
to have a lot of blown and subscription

425
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,730
cards in the fall over the floor

426
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,600
that's getting getting users attention
and leaving trash around

427
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,720
you probably have seen in different
software packages install extra things

428
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,960
or operating systems summer remember
windows 98 holy crap there's just stuff

429
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,860
everywhere have to spend days trying to

430
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:08,120
disentangle if you go to interface
design

431
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:12,080
literature they tell you set intelligent
defaults figure out what the users going

432
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,870
to want to do

433
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,390
in this when I'm not sure what their
intent was but I think it's

434
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,280
the the list illustrates the problem
that you have you will see you can go to

435
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,399
sign up like it automatically checks yes
I'd like to sign up for your

436
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,680
your mailing list to provide were
probably more information about your

437
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,780
products and services

438
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:33,399
I had but I D here setting unintelligent
defaults is a common technique

439
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:38,530
in this when I just wanted me know right
wanna do RAR files with the software

440
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,610
there's a Select All button and this
goes down to another technique they just

441
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:44,050
don't provide functionality

442
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:47,780
you might want in that adversarial
relationship there's no on Select All

443
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,230
button

444
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,290
so you have to you have to mainly in
check each one

445
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,950
and they make it hard make it work
deception

446
00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:01,310
the fall or as ever encountered fake
hyperlinks

447
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,220
hope this one at least they chose to use
cream so you know something is all about

448
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,720
them

449
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,110
fake forms

450
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:16,770
another popular technique and this one
is on a bank rate website and it

451
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,260
actually looks like pretty

452
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,110
its Bankrate selected looks like the
former supposed to fill in the get some

453
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,880
information but actually been around

454
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,380
the bait and switch

455
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,050
when you see a thumbnail on a web page
and you click on what is what supposed

456
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:32,649
to happen

457
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,760
you should see a large picture

458
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,040
well that there's the thumbnail it
actually takes you to register page

459
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,550
that's another common knocking on Google
but just it's a common technique there

460
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,850
some piece of content they

461
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,730
that put a little snippet up that out
there in front view and then so what

462
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,950
what big switch

463
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:54,790
your register for surplus even use

464
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,180
Experts Exchange for yeah

465
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:03,040
I used to in you you'd search was the
first hit many programming

466
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,520
problems you could find great solutions
to well now

467
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,280
and they've you decided not only to make
a a service you have to pay for but now

468
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,190
they have the

469
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,750
the problem and pseudo solutions
underneath

470
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,520
so the answers the responses look just
like you see up there

471
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,080
but if you actually read it it

472
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,679
it's not the solution so this is I just
some random point in time the change

473
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,950
from one model to feel

474
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,400
yes rude beyond all these

475
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,830
%uh so good no I never got that far

476
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,310
okay

477
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,230
and I noticed that the rankings in

478
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,250
in our Google on the weicker dropping no
other sites are coming up let's get to

479
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:46,560
know

480
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:53,560
this

481
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,380
because once gets out

482
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,130
then people buy passes and they might
have done that just for search engine

483
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,200
you know like optimization techniques or
something they the content may need to

484
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,660
be there

485
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,130
other you encounter

486
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:11,430
spoofed YouTube videos looks it's an
image in set up to look like a

487
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:17,060
YouTube video but it's it's supposed to
be content but it's not so that this is

488
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,909
just an example

489
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:23,960
and this is this is kinda fun

490
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,700
on the French I think there's nothing
evil interface design technique

491
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:32,170
love being friendly where you say you
wanna kleck probe snippets a personal

492
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,320
information on people

493
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,580
arm or in return for like micropayments
a personal information in return for

494
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,409
some service

495
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:43,630
and I I think that you can be friendly
and kinda go to the other and

496
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,080
nothing Google Docs app but I think you
all those a and

497
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,540
the and that's just another approach
other approaches manipulate steer the

498
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,970
user really want them to go

499
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,050
so on this one and this is also the

500
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:00,120
the pseudo hyperlinks the example used
earlier

501
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,820
but you can foresee could steer users
around the page once I saw these three

502
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,060
links I found myself driving a certain
way I would be surprised if this evolved

503
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,750
into steering you in some particular
direction maybe toward another

504
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,730
advertisement

505
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:16,690
like a a dead-end Canyon or something
like that you're sending people certain

506
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:17,070
way

507
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,100
but you can force people how they
navigate around in your face

508
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,030
and this just has a a call to roll over
mine field if you touch

509
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:30,680
your explosion have also seen the
rollover minefield with checkboxes so

510
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,960
the creativity here's like

511
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,420
every possible combination every
possible variant people explore

512
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:42,420
you can bury your land mines in the
rollover minefield so here

513
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,760
I've never seen this a it's just a word
it's just weird Florida

514
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,040
looks like the word Florida and decode
your and then it turns into a pop-up

515
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,700
advertised

516
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:58,230
and as we look to the future virtual
worlds

517
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:01,620
okay evil interfaces are theirs well
here

518
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,230
you can purchase in a big placard in for
the United States Capitol building that

519
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,260
blocks the user until they view the

520
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,850
a until I view the advertised it's for
sale right now everyone wants to

521
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:17,770
purchase it another technique is to have
the hidden goal

522
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,020
so you want the free version of a given
software package insights there's a cab

523
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,560
cab inflows people hide these things but
there's this trail where they have all

524
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,080
the paid versions and then

525
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,370
the 15-day trial versions and eventually
you can find eventually find the free

526
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,930
version that you want and I've been
carried out with me up with ZoneAlarm

527
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,680
another's

528
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,040
that's the content that some looking for
took a while to find the page

529
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:45,500
not too bad but it's better is to be
horrendous and it's surrounded though

530
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,090
with

531
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:50,690
other things that they from what YouTube
do more like us to take the 15-day trial

532
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,960
which is going to expire

533
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,070
which you probably heard you to purchase
the product the dead in trail

534
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,429
so you there some behavior you don't
want these are taking but you need to

535
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,710
give them some someone some
functionality

536
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,050
heroes trying to change my default for a
browser Firefox

537
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,570
and there's is a for HTM files and

538
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:16,570
what does that throws you okay you watch
Egypt fun go find

539
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,610
and then also the

540
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,980
near infinite trail has anyone actually
tried to get that free laptop or iPod

541
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,990
that they've won

542
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,010
has anyone ever tried yes

543
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,000
a yeah well I know one technique
employed by those peoples I think

544
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,169
some people actually have a laptop or
iPod that they've

545
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:39,250
my actually give to someone but they
have in your inflict real questions

546
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,659
and forms to fill and so I know one
person spent hours trying to get it

547
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:49,659
and just went on forever yes so was it
in

548
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:00,980
a near infinite rabbit hole I

549
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,980
the be interesting to have like a
tag-team effort

550
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,400
you we're gonna make you give us that
iPod

551
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:19,179
one of us can't but all of us can so

552
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,030
another technique I was going through
the interface design books too and it

553
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,950
says make shortcuts to help users

554
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:28,580
I accomplish their task wicker so my
task was avoiding advertisements in the

555
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,699
PC world news story not having to go
through eight pages

556
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,860
to do so so what they did is they broke
my shortcut two ways

557
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,160
one them embedded in advertisement in
there

558
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,080
okay but they give me to %uh a a popup
that how to respond to

559
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,279
blocking my way so that's another
technique people uses break shortcuts

560
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,550
manipulating controls so I thought as I
was trying to think broadly about this

561
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,130
problem

562
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,700
you you think there are many places that

563
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,000
interfaces for people trying to
influence this one just idea of

564
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,520
you the genius of how many keyboards on
this planet now have a Windows logo on

565
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:06,830
them

566
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,400
I

567
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,280
will obviously even counter disabling
controls for the people I i've never I

568
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,920
i've a

569
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,680
something beyond a TV these days but
TiVo had the 32nd skip

570
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,500
I'm told that one away because people
don't like you having that functionality

571
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,800
but you seem to civil back buttons right
clicks a fast forwards to all

572
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,570
all to be disabled just more creativity

573
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:36,850
I you go to have never seen menus with
advertisements before

574
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:41,410
up so pulldown menu here in on the left
there's the

575
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,810
what i'm looking for. run the rate they
decide to put a giant advertisement on

576
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,710
the fall down menu

577
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,450
and just a couple love

578
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,160
your different examples the so there's
the time-honored threaten the user

579
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,620
the time-honored from the user and
actually these often many techniques per

580
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,850
employee import from the user

581
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,580
waste their time I that but the trash
around there many

582
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,830
it doesn't have to be just one technique
every time they operate in parallel

583
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:12,960
a confusing the user if you recall back
to the browser wars

584
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,680
I you're there they asked you this is I
explores not your default browser

585
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,470
would you like to change it and know
what your parents to your grandparents

586
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:23,090
do when they see that they think their
computers going to explode

587
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:26,250
so the just the confusing the user with

588
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,430
with two is another technique and this
is the example I promise the idea of the

589
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,730
be other people who influencer flow of
information

590
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,750
can a can getting the interface

591
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,390
so this one it this is from Roger Rogers

592
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,650
internet in Camden skin from our or
weinstein

593
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:49,780
its website oppose a a very good example
the text the

594
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,840
the someone's Google search our Google

595
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,520
you request go to the page and it's
router advertisement at the top

596
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,860
and if people and they have the power to
do that and they can just swap out

597
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,360
advertisements on the fly

598
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,810
Dan Kaminsky call this the Times Square
fact where in movies Times Square

599
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,150
advertisements are swapped out the
someone else's advertisements

600
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,890
but something to think about anyone who
controlled interface

601
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:18,850
even subtle ways art so

602
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:22,589
car taking stigma try to draw a line
around the problem

603
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:25,850
and then look at examples and its crew
like I said it's growing the more you

604
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,029
look the more you see

605
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:30,260
but trying to bring this back and I
think it's useful to

606
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,470
think about how do you measure evil I'm
on web page

607
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:37,550
for an interface in general so one
technique II

608
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,460
what that was to signal to noise ratio
in

609
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,560
what we really got me thinking on this i
watch Fox News

610
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,180
and it seemed like everything was rigged
Ryan heads of people spinning things

611
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,720
breaking things a little tiny news story
wraps

612
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,060
rap down in the middle and in this this
is Computerworld

613
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,990
that's the content okay and if I should
a pressure no such as blacks out

614
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,850
everything else

615
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,680
in and so I just did a raw pixel counts

616
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,279
and if you just do number of pixels to
it the total number pixel and pixels

617
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,670
content to the pixels

618
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,680
on the page you've got fifteen percent
content not not good another

619
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,000
another approach 50 percent I mean their
faces price behind a percent content

620
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,880
but you've got fifteen percent nets some
extreme Anderson navigation items &

621
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,850
things but the core content the news
story

622
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,720
another approach uses just signal to
noise so if you take the ratio signaled

623
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,380
the content to the noise that's 0.1

624
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:41,380
a again not not good but signal to noise
it's not it's just not a linear

625
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,740
relationship signal noise isn't enough

626
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,350
because if you put a spinning head on a
page for example he might take up a

627
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,880
small amount of pixels but its

628
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,550
eruption its is disturbances significant

629
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,060
in just this this example hereof the
other two dancing ladies interests or

630
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,690
earlier

631
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,910
now some people can get away with lots
of people some people can get away with

632
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,160
a little bit of the evil

633
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,480
depends on the value of what the users
seeking some people profesor reading for

634
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,870
the some people pork roll through sewers
to get free porn

635
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,430
I thought something like that was quote
along those lines and there's some

636
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:21,149
price interest in their people tolerate
more based on the value

637
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,540
so if you consider this at the
accessible that wasn't I don't mean to

638
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,230
say that

639
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,160
up if you consider this axis of evil

640
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,410
I some points there's up I'll

641
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:37,020
the and and dude from contrast against
the value of what the users trying to

642
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,090
accomplish

643
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,250
so if he was far less than the value

644
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,460
if they want to do a little bit of evil
may get something they value for more

645
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,650
the satisfied and it is proteins that
threshold the they tolerate

646
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,180
they're not happy the me won't complain
a little bit but I'll still do it

647
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,819
and then there's this threshold for the
cross cross the threshold

648
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,250
and then they start becoming annoyed and
then angry when they become

649
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,500
bankroll angry that could go somewhere
else are gonna blog about it they're

650
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,150
gonna send

651
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,160
tell their friends not to go there

652
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:13,149
we've all been there so there's I think
advertisers public airlines

653
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,200
they give you just enough %uh space so
you don't go with the at an average size

654
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,640
person won't go insane

655
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,129
on that duration flight I think that's
what they're doing with advertisements

656
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:27,160
how much evil based on the value will
the average size citizen

657
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,040
deal with but values relative

658
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,230
every one of us values things
differently some people might even want

659
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:35,060
to

660
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:40,000
up see advertisements have a certain
sort

661
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,770
so don't want and say search in new
sites people may tolerate far less evil

662
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,600
so there's this threshold

663
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,350
and other people maybe I say one very
highly

664
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,860
so they'll tolerate a lot more evil in
and website designers

665
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,220
are and I'm just bring up to arbitrary
examples

666
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,240
but web website designers will

667
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,480
will try and find that sweet spot how
much evil people tolerate before they go

668
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,730
somewhere else

669
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,760
so here's some related play papers I
think you might find interesting

670
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,170
I'll have up on our website I room in
start work are %um

671
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,670
I antes sensor room intelligence I'll

672
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,990
in I'll have thats up there

673
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,980
shortly see him get that the slides

674
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,480
so up could be around the con if you see
me above the chat with you about this

675
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,070
and im

676
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:32,070
we have some time for Q&A I

677
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,350
I know where people learn good interface
design techniques

678
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:38,150
I'd be really interested in your
thoughts on where two people were evil

679
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,660
interface design techniques

680
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,339
do they were in them just for taking
there the existing work

681
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:48,330
and going further but no Jikan examples
out there just extending

682
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,410
I and then ideas where to go from here

683
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:54,850
because I don't think for a perfect
solution

684
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,060
so at it before going to cuny's I just
want to point out

685
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,890
I I'm trying to put numbers to out to
those charts

686
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:05,710
so not just have this axis of evil with
no numbers aside my friend here has

687
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,000
a survey if anybody would want to fill
out there's no names

688
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,210
its circle things one-page if on the way
out you want to grab one I'd be

689
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,660
entirely indebted to you I'm because I
don't run put numbers in color continue

690
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,210
forward with this that would help

691
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:24,100
%uh so just to wrap-up and will first
two new

692
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,450
Microsoft a children's books okay

693
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,660
so microsoft does indeed have a
children's book and this is trying his

694
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,460
kids

695
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,530
its tongue in cheek but it's a trying to
sell or

696
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,720
tell children that it's okay to have
Microsoft himself a server

697
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:41,230
I and other from your friends may be
jealous and and it's okay you can deal

698
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,040
with that

699
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,850
so I i edit it and said do you think
interfaces are great

700
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:50,390
of course you do but there's an ominous
but interfaces are always free

701
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:57,390
so with that I thank you for your time
what your questions

702
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,540
here

703
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:08,720
surf you

704
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,349
I'm for back

705
00:43:11,349 --> 00:43:18,349
you where you here

706
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,420
here

707
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,510
I would think though the marketing the
the advertising community

708
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:29,580
some of these are just evolutions from
the advertising community

709
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,700
I think a lot of its ad hoc people just
have that mindset

710
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,849
they can go in and look at what people
time can you get the idea

711
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:40,369
and then get creative with it so I don't
know if there's like a a book out there

712
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:44,349
that's the Encyclopedia people usability
or our secret website or anything

713
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:49,510
are so I would say the advertising world
kind of studies how to manipulate people

714
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:53,000
and the a lot of it i think is just ad
hoc

715
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,860
that's my take but yes

716
00:43:56,860 --> 00:44:03,860
use you

717
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,220
years

718
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,670
speed yes seems

719
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:32,609
said scenes

720
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:37,060
yes yeah

721
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:41,590
schools

722
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:47,390
heey you

723
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,299
parts

724
00:44:49,299 --> 00:44:52,390
well I think the market is making it
worse they're pushing as far as they can

725
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,049
I think we're getting desensitized
overtime like if you took

726
00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:59,710
do a web user from 1995 or something and
put them on

727
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,740
you know what these spaced pages now the
they'd ask are you nuts

728
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,119
and and things we study guide the
spinning head I mean that that tip

729
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,720
tipped me over to me over the edge but a
lot of people don't see these things

730
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,769
anymore cuz back to that the cut that by
a red wine this

731
00:45:13,769 --> 00:45:17,099
it there is a class divide in its

732
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,490
it's as much a technology detective

733
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,579
technical skill set divide the people in
this room can employ countermeasures

734
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:28,910
in that are somewhat effective and at
the other end of the spectrum people

735
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:29,549
just

736
00:45:29,549 --> 00:45:33,869
helpless so a thats when the reasons why
i wanna talk your today's

737
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:37,010
I don't have all the answers I know
people working on answers by thing to

738
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:38,480
finding a problem well im kinda

739
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,779
showing a path maybe some people get
creative II wish I could say there

740
00:45:42,779 --> 00:45:43,549
something easy

741
00:45:43,549 --> 00:45:46,960
but I don't see sorta

742
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,060
sir

743
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:54,259
good mark

744
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,570
burger he's

745
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,770
all wonder

746
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:07,060
hood

747
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:12,120
whose said

748
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:19,120
miss me

749
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:27,930
he

750
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:34,930
hood

751
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,560
system

752
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,370
this I know Greece's every a
greasemonkey user

753
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:49,279
the comments on that I mean desert work
for yours a

754
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,280
I mean requires a lot of overhead
getting these things no

755
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:14,730
were

756
00:47:17,979 --> 00:47:21,380
be nice to see things like this come out
by default because we've got some basic

757
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:21,920
stuff

758
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,920
with

759
00:47:33,059 --> 00:47:40,059
me

760
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,259
so I'm that thats I think the key when
it goes back to the question about the

761
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:48,990
masses

762
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,280
it's really has to be installed by
default has two more or less work

763
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,610
but if it's a slow by the the fall
people get mad people make money off
