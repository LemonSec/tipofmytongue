um

17
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:57,629
before introduced now some friends can
see that pledges are automatically like

18
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,669
lower everybody else you're doing it
because guys give rep give mouse around

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,989
because she was hacked DC's first

20
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:07,070
donor I

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,070
idle literally had the hack DC pay pal
button up for five minutes

22
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,090
I didn't tell anybody about I didn't
email than mouse just somehow finds it

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,430
like I thought it was an error

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:23,539
like what did sandy hackney if um but
again I do have a couple announcements

25
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:28,659
and I'm actually a shame that I have to
read this please use restraint

26
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:34,079
and please don't mess with the hotel I
shouldn't have to read this when you

27
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,719
guys

28
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,740
come on work we are all adults or at
least there should be enough

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,469
adults here to keep the kids in check
alright

30
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,049
so if you can and then that's another
thing like you know ninety-nine percent

31
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,289
if you are responsible gooden

32
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:53,229
you note people and it's always the one
percent it screws up for everybody else

33
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:56,799
but you know that 99 percent still has a
responsibility

34
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,939
to if they see the one percent doing
something

35
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,969
to either stop it themselves or inform
someone so that they can stop it

36
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:07,450
the hotel's been really really good to
hope

37
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,569
every hope that has gone on can you just
give around applause for the hotel

38
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,319
upon all the hard work that they're
doing so

39
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,239
come on guys don't don't please don't
mess with them II

are on behalf weirdly up the state of
Ohio although it turns out it effects

63
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,989
about 43 US states random

64
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,549
other places threatening me urban
fortunate or unfortunate enough to have

65
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:57,549
same technology use here

66
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,530
of so are I'm gonna be talking I'm at
plays

also this is a joint work with Adam

69
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:13,319
ararat kronen corruption Mike

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,680
share we're all here and pulse there any

71
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,350
turned invisible so are international

72
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,350
conference so just forgive me for a
couple minutes

73
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,860
up doesn't or not voters

74
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,479
in the United States sometimes find it a
little bit hard to understand

75
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,969
just of how inherently complicated

76
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,979
US elections are compared with almost
everywhere else in the world

77
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,070
and what I mean by complicated is that
there is not

78
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,250
a single you know US Department up

79
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,910
elections and voting rather this system

80
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,070
it was designed up really at the time of
the US Constitution

81
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,099
what's setup as a a highly decentralized

82
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,190
a distributed system and at

83
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,430
determining the outcome %uh everything

84
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,440
from national elections for president

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:11,770
to federal elections for members of
congress

86
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,490
to vocal are and state elections for
things like governor and share of

87
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,580
and on library board in school

88
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,219
ordinal judgeships so on

89
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,729
are we often have elections for both

90
00:05:27,729 --> 00:05:33,849
federally offices and state offices and
local offices going on at the same time

91
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,740
and we be vote for a higher proportion

92
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,620
of our representatives directly than
almost any other

93
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,060
country I'll similar size and structure

94
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,180
and so what that means is that going to
a voting booth not simply

95
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,289
checking a box for your candidate on
depending on

96
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,770
on what election it is you may be making
something like fifty

97
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:59,919
decisions some of which may be seen for
the first time

98
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,139
up when you when you walk into the
voting I N

99
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:07,830
we somehow have also expected that at
the end of the evening

100
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,020
you know five minutes after the polls
close wonder

101
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,299
one I and we tend to have gotten

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,590
into the habit of knowing the results of
elections

103
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,240
very very quickly after so in the United
States we have this

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,110
highly decentralized system with there's
no central authority running

105
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,440
things %uh the local are elections are
run

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,389
locally of the federal government's
that's brought standards there's the US

107
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:36,130
Constitution involved somewhere in there

108
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,409
and the elections themselves a really
really complex

109
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,870
so as as as hackers and as

110
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,050
computer are oriented X our

111
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,400
of first reaction activists might be hey
maybe computers could have

112
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,370
me here maybe that could help manage
this very complicated

113
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,690
decentralized distributed system and in
fact computers

114
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,110
having used calculating the outcome

115
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,720
all of election sense pretty close to
the very beginning

116
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,379
site quick question of how many of you
have seen this picture before

117
00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:15,870
does anybody who recognizes this picture

118
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,169
yeah outside so what is this picture

119
00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:24,310
Florida recount why were they went with
a recounting

120
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,129
hanging tracks whether term than I
thought only of people

121
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:31,160
punch cards back in the IBM dates

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,780
so you look like what a small for

123
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,550
okay pics sure gonna future

124
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,210
okay be up this became kinda emblematic

125
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,250
all American elections sirkin 2000

126
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,509
for those of you we're all a little bit
younger you might recall we are

127
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,030
presidential election

128
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,539
are in the United States in 2000 arm a
fellow by the name

129
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,770
0 for bush and a fellow by the name
before were

130
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,229
running against each other to become
president of the United States

131
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,628
the outcome of the election him up

132
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,389
in the end on are a couple of precincts

133
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:13,680
in Florida and that were very very close
and there were questions raised about

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,470
the accuracy of the count up this punch
card

135
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,930
arm electromechanical ballot count
system

136
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:25,039
of it but idk place and this picture I'm
not sure if the

137
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,210
account risk is good up but this is
probably familiar to live you because

138
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,820
this of I came to

139
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,870
the emblematic I'll a problem

140
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,320
with elections in the United States this
poor man

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,370
kinda bug-eyed as as thick glasses

142
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,600
and is clearly over dressed for the
Florida climate

143
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,300
you know spent studying this car trying
to figure out

144
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,770
you know what does it all mean and this
this picture was

145
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:57,860
was repeatedly on the front page of
newspapers and magazines

146
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,450
and so on and it with it came to
symbolize what's wrong with elections

147
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:05,860
this poor man has to

148
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,810
this squinting but if this poor man has
to look so closely this card

149
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,160
surely there's a better way to do this
but it but in fact

150
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,610
I think one of the things we've come to
realize is that the me

151
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,140
up this picture and domestic take away
from this picture

152
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,180
has kinda herkst on this

153
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,560
actually is coming to me into a lot of
people to symbolize the strength

154
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,830
of the way its were counted at the time

155
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,920
in that there was a question about the
tabulation system

156
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,349
what what it turned out you could do is

157
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,490
with enough work examined

158
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,710
the evidence and the forensics left
behind

159
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,980
by the voters and tell whether or not
the machines

160
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,910
gave an answer that in fact what
reflected

161
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,000
what people voted for so if you didn't
trust machines

162
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,180
you could get about an army of people
with white shirts and ties thick glasses

163
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,750
and bulging eyes to look at these cards
and

164
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,190
and and double check the results up
machines and I think

165
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,080
that was a great strength I'll the
system as it existed then

166
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,470
in a lot of places arm before

167
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,250
something called the Help America Vote
Act of so

168
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,600
after the 2000 election congress

169
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,420
hurry past walks everyone agreed the
situation

170
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,630
Eric of hurry past a waffle Help America
Vote Act

171
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:36,300
and it basically mandated a shift

172
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,790
not to computerized voting directly back

173
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,120
what was called accessible voting
technology and

174
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,310
what that mean make was that voting
technology

175
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,550
the of something that the disable could
use

176
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,900
blind people bility impaired people and
so on

177
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:57,290
could use on footing and without
assistance are

178
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,699
with everyone else now in effect if that

179
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,210
was that the only systems that met

180
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,970
this require were heavily computerized
computerized

181
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,370
user interfaces like touch screens that
could have

182
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,340
audio input and output and motion
sensors and sip and puff sensors and so

183
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,790
on

184
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,010
a tax cut them to collect think

185
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:23,480
up some tax machines came

186
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,160
could be outcome consider equivalent

187
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,660
to the Help America Vote Act
requirements

188
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,010
now the congress get something else at
the same time is creating

189
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,240
mandate for new voting technology they

190
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,870
also allocated I use by prewar standards

191
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:47,080
I love money Obama to for all of the
states and all of the

192
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,580
hits to buy new voting equipment

193
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,720
so out with a a time I know basically
said within a couple beers

194
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,180
you need to go and get yourself new
voting equipment

195
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,850
that meets the Help America Vote Act but
don't worry because there's a big pile

196
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,900
money you can use by so what do you
think act

197
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,220
well on that money was going to get
spent and in fact

198
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,620
their were are a number of vendors

199
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,880
who in the best traditions

200
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,240
American enterpreneurship you know came
forward with

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,380
voting systems that's that states could
buy

202
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,070
to meet the Help America Vote Act
requirements out about if they're a

203
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,960
great sense

204
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,140
altruism now

205
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,930
what does this mean well they're
basically three technologies

206
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:40,270
up that we're putting place of

207
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,680
right after the thousand election of an
existing beforehand

208
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,360
but they're not really widely deployed
the most well-known

209
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,510
I wanna call these its 10 weirdest
acronyms

210
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,810
ever you think touch-screen voting
machines would be called touch-screen

211
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,770
voting machines

212
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:58,430
but they at invent a new track for them
they're called

213
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,740
a direct recording electronic machines
they

214
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,810
directly for your votes using and
electronic

215
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,670
user interface Cox Creek feasible ya
remix

216
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,670
see if you ever wanna press table voting
official

217
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,700
or scare them withheld you are

218
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,850
refer to them as dere

219
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,810
extends these are basically a
specialized your computer

220
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,060
with a touch screen interfaces some
fancy

221
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,260
fancy caissons from where that Canton

222
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,730
voting for choice of there also

223
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,050
optical scan ballots similar to

224
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:38,450
you know what UK the SAT's way back in
my days

225
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,720
filling with a number two pencil your
your elections

226
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,180
you put in agreed to your ballot from
right person

227
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:51,260
go on to the next election of the you
basically fill out a little paper ballot

228
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,730
and put that in the polling place
Antwerp reader

229
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,690
that counts your vote collects your
ballots puts the paper ballot in a

230
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:03,430
in a ballot box and then then you vote

231
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,010
now the way they make them up compatible
with help America Vote Act

232
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,640
is with the technology %uh where you
basically take a touch screen interface

233
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,060
except instead of recording your vote
arm

234
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,590
it marks a ballot that they that then
gets put in with the other ballots

235
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,870
into the the local precinct ballot

236
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,370
so basically the disabled or anyone else
who wants

237
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,450
the Knights user interfaces with the re-
still

238
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,500
is the touchscreen what they produces a
paper ballot

239
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,530
put into this ballot counter the machine
itself isn't involved in doing anything

240
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:43,740
other that marking the ballot separate
ballot reader

241
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,870
recounting up so another

242
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,870
third technology that's that's quite use

243
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,020
of are centrally counted versions of
this

244
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,130
these are typically used for things like
absentee ballots you say you're not

245
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,020
gonna be around on election day

246
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,240
goal if you a send you one of these in
the mail

247
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,770
mail it back on election day if you love
the absentee ballots

248
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:09,250
into a big you know backs and version
machine

249
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,810
it meets all about and produces and up

250
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:16,050
ok so that's essentially what the
technology

251
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:19,490
voting post help America Vote Act looks
like

252
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,430
every state now uses except
interestingly enough

253
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,880
the state where an uses one are these

254
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,530
technology all later

255
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,260
now was also involved is that there are

256
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,910
your vendors up this of worry

257
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,339
voting official what by voting equipment

258
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,490
up you can buy it from one of four
companies

259
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,000
better currently in disaster happy sell
it to you

260
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,290
are and want yes an ass

261
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,959
another small park interest civic
another spot qua a

262
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,990
and then there's another premier premier

263
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,380
you may have heard of up by the previous
name used to be called

264
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,010
Bible and they beta value check

265
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,290
another premier election systems of

266
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,959
the two largest they all produce both
pren optical scan systems

267
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,280
the two largest are yes an asset premier

268
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,089
or people of and now I i think it is

269
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,220
safe tests today that

270
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,640
there have been questions raised about
whether or not this technology

271
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,140
is in fact faithful whether or not it
really does

272
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,750
record what voters asked to report

273
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,320
and whether or not it's fun or more
vulnerable

274
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,720
tampering in the system's place

275
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,840
that is you know 10 the people in this
room

276
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,900
of put their minds together and figure
out how to get

277
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,010
themselves elected president yeah

278
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,020
are we better off doing this cuz this
somehow favor the geeks

279
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,500
so in order to address the question how
far the secure

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,540
there with the systems put in place you
can't just sell

281
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,530
voting equipment start-up goes boating
equipment store

282
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,670
you have to get your equipment certified
by arm

283
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,880
testing labs that it turns out the
vendors themselves

284
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,740
pay for of there are occasional
independent reviews

285
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,550
invariably the independent reviews up
reveal

286
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,680
serious questions and then nothing
actually changers

287
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,630
are the hardware and designs and the
software and firmware

288
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:36,020
run on the system's a closely-held trade
secrets by all

289
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,210
for vendors these are not not open
source code

290
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,460
look at so if there are problems their
hidden for most of us

291
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,550
which even goes further feeding these
questions about

292
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,909
hey are the system's actually secure
enough

293
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:54,090
abused real elections now

294
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,429
Ohio is an interesting state it's one of
those states that

295
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,780
in which elections are very heavily
politicized and

296
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,040
looks democrats suppose Republican

297
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,550
elections going to be controversial be
very

298
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,940
haven't noticed events there the user

299
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,430
White Plains technology arm

300
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:18,170
up for all approved by the Ohio
Secretary of State

301
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:22,660
States Secretariat speak to you of the

302
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,650
I am in Ohio the secretary of state's

303
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:30,190
job among other things is approving the
voting technology

304
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,380
its it's used their of and forced a

305
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,860
by the same equipment from three out of
the four vendors

306
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,360
of that every other state is fine only
for vendors

307
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,810
stuff and i cant special Ohio voting

308
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:47,300
me make software a little bit customized

309
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,560
but this thereby same hardware largely
the same

310
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,860
software somewhere as everyone else so

311
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,030
Ohio an interesting thing

312
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,070
last year following on the

313
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,439
tale love California which did a
comprehensive top to bottom

314
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,880
love voting technology that I was
involved in

315
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,020
of the state of Ohio wanted to do the
same thing

316
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,330
for their voting technology and day

317
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,439
use again 3 up the system's

318
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,050
that are of three of the four vendors
California

319
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,350
three of the four vendors but not the
same three so that was not

320
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,780
lead over one of the vendors systems yes
an ass

321
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,240
had never actually been included in a

322
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,350
independent review of the entire system

323
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,020
as a whole all so basically Ohio what

324
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,360
to a couple of academic institutions
Penn State

325
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,680
and the University of Pennsylvania arm

326
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm University Pennsylvania and asked us
if we be willing

327
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,310
to do similar view

328
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,919
of so when I got asked to do this for
small mean an interesting

329
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,310
property is when you thank the secretary
of state

330
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,669
the perceptions to deliver that very
quickly

331
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:08,230
explain I wasn't talking about and Lisa
but

332
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:11,480
made everyone thought I was back but

333
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,530
it raises the question of should we
actually be involved in this

334
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:19,190
is this a good idea to of and in
particular the fact that would be

335
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,030
looking at

336
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,100
trade secret code raise some alarm bells

337
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,770
do with this constraining us about what
we could say what we could do in the

338
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:27,910
future

339
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,670
on secondly don't would we be able to do
a good job

340
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,730
you know they were asking us to look at
are

341
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,420
an entire Cisco that we had never seen
before

342
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,940
could never have seen before hardware
software from where

343
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,430
and everything else %uh in a period
about

344
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,800
two months away if we don't find
anything

345
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,200
okay from he finds problems we know
there are problems there

346
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,780
if we don't find problems it might just
be that we were gone

347
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,510
alright maybe we've just got clever
enough maybe if we had a little more

348
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,410
time

349
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,010
or you were a little bit smarter there
are some your

350
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,650
me on our ability that we didn't find we
would hate

351
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,500
to have to implicitly put our seal of
approval

352
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,220
on something that in fact we're not
saying you secure

353
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,590
we're just saying we didn't find any any
defects

354
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,909
so the question of whether or not it's
ethical to be involved in a review

355
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,330
that's inherently

356
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,810
by its nature going to be up

357
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,169
week of course you know you can't tell

358
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:34,710
that software is free of defects

359
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,000
you can only tell that it has effects
that you found

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,380
um now you know not only can you tell
weekend it's like

361
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,750
the only thing in computer science we
can't prove is that you can't figure out

362
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,850
the answer to this

363
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,360
so this is a really important result
that

364
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,810
may not be well understood up by people

365
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,100
meeting the out up this so we were a
little bit hesitant

366
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,740
ultimately decided are you know we kinda
bring our teeth and said okay

367
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,100
this may be worth doing anyway so we

368
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,380
the first problem will be solved was I A

369
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,380
very painful contract negotiation

370
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,360
in which we had to ensure our
independence

371
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,450
so we had to make sure that we would
really be able to do an independent

372
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,120
review

373
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,460
get access all of the source code that
up

374
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,480
above the system get access to all of
the hardware have

375
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,360
adequate towards looking at it
conditions that would lead of actually

376
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,920
to an independent review not have to
take anyone's work for how anything is

377
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,560
set up

378
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,990
and most importantly get maintain our
editorial control over the out

379
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,310
so one things that we were very careful
and insistent on

380
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,840
what's that wouldn't do it unless week

381
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:52,020
control the report that we were
publishing that

382
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,129
vendors political forces yup

383
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,500
edit our report before it got published

384
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,570
there will be a published report pain
our findings

385
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,429
and no one would be able to sensory

386
00:23:05,430 --> 00:23:09,670
after the fact or for suck change any of
her findings

387
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,710
like that we did agree that any

388
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,620
source code that we were going to
illustrate

389
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,210
things in our report we would publish
unpublished an axe

390
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:25,580
that would only go to stay wouldn't put
that in the published report any actual

391
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:29,530
code snippets from the vendors secret
code

392
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,889
but all of the findings be in our in
this published report under our control

393
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,570
so that took the first 10 weeks the
project finally

394
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,990
we actually did work

395
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,420
the but we were successful doing so
there were out three academic teams

396
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:45,930
working

397
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,960
on this wanna Penn State by Patrick
McDaniel

398
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,570
another UCSD web why security by funny

399
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,490
and then 18 University of Pennsylvania
we divided the systems of

400
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:00,890
off by vendor I was lucky and we got the
one that no one had looked at before

401
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,070
so we got it to look at the yes and that
system

402
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,090
that again nobody had the entire system

403
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,209
as a whole up for me

404
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,450
okay so why is this hard why can't why
is it hard to evaluate

405
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,030
voting why why don't you get ten weeks
yes

406
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,720
theory he's like the simplest problem in
the world

407
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,320
imagine that somewhere buried in the
voting system

408
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,520
there's a line of code somewhere that
says something like you know its

409
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,760
candidate

410
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,220
candidate plus one or you know if it's
in C candidate

411
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,300
plus plus its coal at 12 votes candidate

412
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,559
and you know you should be able to do
this with Brett right

413
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,629
look for this lie if it's a give it says
you know

414
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,020
plus to you you know something's wrong
or

415
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,650
-1 then you know something's wrong but
if line in there

416
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,170
it's only in their wants and you can
only reach one happen

417
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,710
its or alive morning solving this this
simplest

418
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,300
problem in the world but you know theory

419
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,340
theory and practice in the same

420
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,689
so in practice you've got a lot more
than just a voting machine that's going

421
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,120
the tallying I'll every time you push
the button adding one

422
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,980
discounter you have an election
management system

423
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,740
software that a

424
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,340
defines the balance that provision the
computer the voting computers

425
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,389
but the re- machines on the optical
answers the firmware

426
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,320
running in the hardware that sent out to
the precincts

427
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,320
others communication basically it may be
involved

428
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,189
sneaker nackt but there's a big
communication system for getting

429
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,520
the things that the voting locations
back to the county headquarters

430
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,040
and maybe involves modems or maybe
involves

431
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,730
thing memory cards or equipment back and
forth but that system

432
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:54,960
for communicating result again is part
of what you have to

433
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,660
exam and then there's this human element
ther procedures

434
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,430
that people aren't following there are
mechanical locks and seals

435
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:07,110
their procedures for dealing with he's
of and and so on and so on

436
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,520
so of this is a actually pretty
complicated system

437
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,379
and threat model itself is pretty how

438
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,570
right this is not a simple as most other
systems

439
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,980
because we have threats that don't exist

440
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,130
anything other than voting if the usual
things

441
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,620
can somebody alter data and somebody
tonight's service

442
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,260
scan somebody changed the official
results updating

443
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:36,290
equity but you also have ballot secrecy

444
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:39,930
issues right won the attacks against
voting system is figuring out

445
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,730
someone voted for a system needs to be
secure not trust

446
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,090
for integrity but it also has not have

447
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,530
accountability so somehow get that data
integrity

448
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,840
but not accountability back the
individual voter which is not the usual

449
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,240
way

450
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,860
to data integrity so it's a complicated

451
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:03,200
system we looked at at Penn its largest
energy used in 43 States

452
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,890
up by something like forty percent
holders in the US

453
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,950
they have both re: and opticals the
centerpiece

454
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,340
system is there Dr Hamish which was
pulled in I

455
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,740
Tron spec not made by Apple

456
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,630
on the it's basically a custom computer

457
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,700
that runs proprietary from where attacks

458
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,730
models used in Ohio have a printer
attachment

459
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:30,790
that F select a candidate prints out

460
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,050
the fact select the candidate on this

461
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:38,059
will continuously printer to allow for
non-electric

462
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,290
its and that's called a

463
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,230
border verify paper auditorium these
machines are controlled by the special

464
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,480
module but basically turns them on Fri
voter

465
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,640
for the personalized electronic ballot
be

466
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,620
causal module turns the tide here's what
it looks like

467
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,670
are basically a touch screen there's a
little slow that little red bars the

468
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,530
slot

469
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:04,410
with a have unit and this has been
enabled for voting

470
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:08,520
here's a printer it's on the side the
printer that's on the site

471
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,160
basically pretzel barcode

472
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,260
voted for so Archos scan

473
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,390
in the event recount problem with that

474
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,179
that actually verified most

475
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:27,450
on this is the level of personal
electronic ballot module

476
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,780
is order next week an idea scale

477
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,240
it's basically you for reading device up
with a Mac

478
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,030
Mac turns on the computer and unit heard

479
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,860
through this little artsy

480
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,130
so the software for the eiffel product
the re-

481
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:49,410
is health sex

482
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:53,640
runs has about 88,000 lines of code
written in C and assembly

483
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,980
some libraries turned out not to get and
some additional software

484
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,450
X specific to the back-end system for
provisioning and

485
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,220
and counting the results out

486
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,690
there's an optical scan system of the
model 100

487
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,809
the precinct and after basically is

488
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:14,870
looks kinda like a fax machine sitting
on top Ave

489
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:18,970
shredder although it doesn't actually
have a traitor fax

490
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,460
assured are it's basically a scanner

491
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,559
that sits on top of the ballot box that
flock accept or reject your ballot

492
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,410
you putting tribal for two people for
president it'll reject your ballot

493
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,740
rather than just saying okay thanks

494
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:36,650
taking a spoiled ballots so it's has
better usability than just putting it

495
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,850
dropping it in a ballot box by itself

496
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,890
and the thing that scans your ballot
also counts

497
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,940
your vote for me pricing Anderson

498
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,340
colonel on memory card hold

499
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,860
both the ballot definition that it
accepts and

500
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,050
Halle that thats thats

501
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,379
during the election there's a wonderful
looks like and its

502
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,860
sort of fact shredder looking

503
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:08,090
fun these little PCMCIA factor

504
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,590
memory parts now this offer for that

505
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,920
it's also an Intel 86 class processor
with about

506
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,340
thirty thousand lines of code and again
and

507
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:22,650
and there's a central system happens the
fun

508
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,550
value his hikes backs Tanner

509
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,040
we had send us 1 it had to be delivered
by truck

510
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,809
wanna back injury hi Adam

511
00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:38,250
doing better of as what

512
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,650
thing looks like a cool thing about it
is it's designed to process

513
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,770
all of the ballots for an election in
one day ballots

514
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,080
really fast into the ballot box except
they can actually give us the ballot box

515
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,850
catches them

516
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,970
so what ends up happening ballots go in
and then

517
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,320
shootout through the side of the neck
kinda it

518
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,750
at the wall after standing on the other
side really

519
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:06,000
papercut surprise putting little saw
blades for it

520
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,200
that sinkhole 686 processor about 22,000

521
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,650
code close again back sources back

522
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,760
the backup system run for running in the
elections is called

523
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,160
unity their election management's sweet

524
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,280
and it does ballot definition
provisioning up the Eiffel products the

525
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:25,639
pre

526
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,780
the Dr E's the precinct optical scan
counters

527
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,790
and the central Kansas and then

528
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:36,270
collecting the results from all of those
precincts producing a tally

529
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,580
printing out the official results for
the county's

530
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,040
different races and happy and then
auditing Greek

531
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,389
basically this is a software pack on
wrong

532
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,750
on your Windows PC in the county office

533
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,429
it's designed to run on a single PC but
what a lot of

534
00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:57,030
but you know sense you're doing a lot of
different voting machines with a lot of

535
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,780
counties typically do is use Windows
networking and shared file system

536
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,928
on this database me ok to allow multiple
machines

537
00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:08,900
run Windows box network Windows boxes

538
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,070
running this special software back

539
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,428
so what's this look like well standard
get a standard Windows platform

540
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:19,750
about 400,000 lines of code antsy

541
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,760
c plus plus see all Visual Basic

542
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,250
and Cole that was exciting over

543
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,330
and again it includes get this with
customized module

544
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,580
County we bought prez you don't get the
optical scan stuff

545
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,639
or but nixon battery whatever

546
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,049
modules for counting dollar

547
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:44,530
need to give you an idea data flows this
is the

548
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:48,470
data flow throughout the software other
what you'd better take away from this is

549
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,420
it's complicated basically a basic
architecture is

550
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,730
there's provisioning data about design

551
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,040
programming the %uh individual devices

552
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,700
loading them onto the devices and then
at the end of the day going back to the

553
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,950
election management says

554
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:09,000
from the precinct devices to get Italian

555
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,230
so we've got when we do

556
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,679
turn it over to us sandy

557
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,150
tell you the fun stuff cell

558
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,490
first of course we had to do with secure
environment

559
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,830
and we turn whatever offices in a skiff
we changed all the locks and we got in

560
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,440
trouble with the University locksmith

561
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,500
again

562
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:36,049
and we took possession of the whole
thing to say because everything we

563
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,139
worked on every piece of paper we
printed out

564
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,240
our lab notebooks everything had to be
locked in a safe

565
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,880
every time skiff this source code S&S

566
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,590
stuff was protected better than cheney's
undisclosed location

567
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,360
so what do we do well there were seven
us

568
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:58,679
we have less than 10 weeks at seven
thousand lights

569
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,679
no methodology no check list that we
could it could have made up

570
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,160
was gonna be able to get through all of
this so basically

571
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,530
we did triage we divide everything up
into parts

572
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,560
and everybody sat down and said okay
attack

573
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,029
so what exactly did we find

574
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:24,640
well here's a list

575
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,940
now that's not all yes it is something
that's hard and come here but you get

576
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,520
the idea

577
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:31,810
the thing that surprised is that

578
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:36,489
there wasn't a place where we locked
that we didn't find a vulnerability

579
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,250
we could compromise there wasn't 10 an
attack that we tried

580
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,370
we were successful in carrying through
and

581
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:49,210
this is in spite all security procedures
that the SNS has complex

582
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,409
sheets and the security procedures
include

583
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:56,260
physical security their locks includes
tamper evident seal

584
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,720
the top-of-the-line on Dr East all have
a hard work dedication to

585
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,830
there's also passwords Anderson Creek so

586
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:09,360
why didn't these these layers of
security protect

587
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,030
system let's look at a couple of these
individual all-star

588
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,410
locks this is a lot by the same
manufacturer

589
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:21,210
that that makes the on the S&S not
providing she missed it right is

590
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:21,820
actually from

591
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,150
day on they are cheap cabinet

592
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,670
or of china cabinet way for locks you
can buy them anywhere

593
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,540
you can get the keys anywhere you can
get the blanks week

594
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:36,270
know this production keys for a couple
weeks

595
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:43,270
this is that he's cheap way for locks

596
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,530
you can pick them with a paperclip and
seems ES&S uses two keys they use want

597
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,490
to control the electronics and want to
open

598
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:55,740
and I'm lock up the ballot box we have
to pick the locks just

599
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,080
to turn the machines on in the first
place the fact that they use two keys

600
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,370
is the real problem here you see they
only

601
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,529
use to keep every machine they sell
whether it's

602
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:11,150
New York California why uses the same

603
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:18,150
to keep okay that doesn't give me much
confidence in their physical security so

604
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,290
what about tamper evident seal that's
another

605
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,390
right I'm yes in essence hardware

606
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,400
the touchscreens and the optical
scanners

607
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,450
used three different kinds of removable
media the UCF cards

608
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,490
they use PCMCIA cards and they use sift
and Ohio's elections procedures

609
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,690
specifically state

610
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,200
that was media is inserted into the slot
the slot has to be covered

611
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,110
wanted these tamper evident seals so how
could a

612
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:51,490
at detecting evidence of tampering
here's your chance to earn a t-shirt

613
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:58,140
somebody give me a way to remove the
seals undetectable

614
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:05,140
one at a time what do you think about
steam works great w40 another really

615
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:06,820
good

616
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:12,770
your teachers 140

617
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:16,830
so huh I'm you know how it works really
well

618
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,710
scope called actually works better than
on

619
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,340
and of course you can always just five

620
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,710
the name manufacturers on the labels
just order a bunch

621
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:34,710
the

622
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:37,180
notice that the label is

623
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,609
over the CS but there's nothing
protecting back

624
00:37:40,609 --> 00:37:44,299
these machines have a lot of open
accessible

625
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:50,069
completely unprotected ports what people
actually

626
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:53,308
plot this flood well secretary of state
printer told us

627
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:57,119
that until she had seen this photograph
she hadn't understood her on the people

628
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,020
have been telling her

629
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,279
her election observers had watched the
last Ohio election

630
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,440
normal voters woke up on election day
plot that clock

631
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,289
and of course what does that do that
disables the auditory

632
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:13,480
so much for a paper record course it
also gives you access

633
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,390
to the printer port so you can print
whatever you want on the audit trail and

634
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,020
in addition on some other machines have
Ethernet ports motor parts

635
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:30,369
kept some other hidden by the crack
locks

636
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:32,160
so another problem with these touch
screens

637
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,420
is that they are seriously easy to
recalibrate

638
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,750
think I don't you can see on the screen

639
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,320
on but the calibrate just like any

640
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,010
any touch screen %uh you poke the
accident was somewhere else in your

641
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:47,960
pocket somewhere else

642
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,960
so what happens if you put that X

643
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,070
in the wrong place on purpose you can
make it

644
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,520
impossible to to for this machine to
record books for a particular candidate

645
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,240
and this is so simple to do we found it
within the first five minutes

646
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:07,630
turn the machine on first time now

647
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:13,150
a major party s missus touchscreen
security is that little box with the red

648
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,589
strike that you see in the slot

649
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:18,190
that set personal electronic ballot on

650
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,210
the pic that is yes it is hard work
dedication to

651
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,619
and you needed to with the machine to
turn on in the first place

652
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,540
you need to upload the firmware you
needed to install a ballot definition

653
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,849
you need to open the polls you're out
the vote totals

654
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:35,280
close the pores collect all the the
result at the end the election you

655
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,540
gotta have one of these and you can't
buy we did try

656
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,740
but in our world yet and one have a
community

657
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,900
if you can't buy something and you've
got to have how do you get

658
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,339
together you make it yourself and we
made ours

659
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:59,339
with the PTA and I magnin ca

660
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,880
there's a photo Mike turning all the
passwords

661
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,070
everest so

662
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,339
the documentation for S&S list 3

663
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:18,400
hindsight these personal electronic out
the first one is a blue one and that's

664
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,099
I a voter and that allows one voter to
cast one about

665
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:27,349
the second one has a red stripe on it
and that's supervisor that allows a paul

666
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,920
worked

667
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,160
to tensions on to open/close

668
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,379
polls in to collect all the votes
there's a third kinda have with the

669
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,180
yellow strike

670
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,390
and thats a reset can use either by exit
poll worker or by

671
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:42,440
offenders representative and recess they

672
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,980
the machine back to its default if
there's a problem but imagine our

673
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:47,599
surprise

674
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,339
his such an important part up the
security

675
00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:54,390
up these touch screens imagine our
surprise

676
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,799
we found that there's a Fourth Kind

677
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,960
you see if not just in the documentation

678
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,050
but there's this path that allows you to
have complete

679
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:13,119
route access to the machine and it
doesn't require a password

680
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,880
that's my definition a back door

681
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,450
I'm I don't know what color it is but
ours was great

682
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,950
so I think it's it's pretty common
knowledge

683
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:31,700
that the touchscreens are broken I think
if you ask most people they would say

684
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,510
that you really can't trust the security

685
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:37,220
on these touch screens and that just
leaves us

686
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,730
the optical scanners by

687
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:46,430
there are a lot of problems the optical
scanners let's get into a few

688
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,919
summer that have to do with the
passwords and the Christian that are

689
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,900
used by the

690
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,900
by defenders

691
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:58,890
in the case at both the precinct

692
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,049
individual ballots care the

693
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,150
central election headquarters Big Bash

694
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,720
both of them will upload and run
firmware

695
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:14,040
without asking for a password so if you
can get access to the removable media

696
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,100
you can put your own for more on their
stick in this life and it will uploaded

697
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,900
and it will run it

698
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,710
no questions asked they also did not do

699
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,040
any form of encryption on removable
media so once those water are collected

700
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,270
and you can get access to the media you
can alter the votes

701
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,960
on the results of that election and
there's no way for

702
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:40,960
anyone to be able to tell that you don't
here's a picture by the way up the

703
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,550
big back scanner reading our efforts for

704
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,920
so what about

705
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,080
the paper about and that's pretty much
all that's left

706
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,230
well there are problems with that you
see

707
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:01,020
because in those cheap crappy way for
locks it's truly simple to get access to

708
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,070
the glass surface at the scanner so all
you have to do

709
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,440
open the scanner up and put a post down
where you don't want the votes to count

710
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:12,130
paint something reflect male something
on I'm

711
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:18,880
and then of course it's truly simple to
forge the paper ballots as well

712
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,220
on the paper ballots rely for the
security

713
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,620
on something called norm Reed

714
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,890
and you'll find this Inc on

715
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:32,950
security certificates like stock
certificates

716
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,450
defeat on deeds the C dot checks or
cashier's check sometimes usually its

717
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:40,900
wavy lines or an abstract pattern in a
yellow incorporating

718
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,840
and you realize for security on the fact
that that Inc

719
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,130
is invisible to the scanner so on this
ballot

720
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:52,600
summer these boxes are printed in
regular and some others boxes are

721
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,720
printed in security

722
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,990
the one at the top is is in the security

723
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,190
and when you put that out through

724
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,000
the scanner either the batch 1 or the
individual precinct 1 the scanner can't

725
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:05,920
see Mark's

726
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,140
where that where the security and it
just passes that outright

727
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,200
trip but if you try and make a photocopy
of the talent we try and print out your

728
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,050
own version of it

729
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,610
that prints out in regular Inc the
scanner seized boxes

730
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,590
where it shouldn't see boxes and it spit
it out and it prints across at LCD

731
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,290
screen possibly counterfeit

732
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,720
so how do you forge about that's got
this

733
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,540
this high-security with whiteout

734
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:36,009
all you have to do is get rid of the
little security boxes

735
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,200
make as many copies as you want and a
scanner can tell the difference

736
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,280
this fellow was accepted as authentic
but both our scanners

737
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,660
now you might think that

738
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:49,899
and %uh alert election observer might
notice that those boxes are missing they

739
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,550
might not

740
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:54,120
remember Matt talked about the fact that
every single precinct election is

741
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:54,589
different

742
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,680
and everything about looks different
because my dog catchers in the same as

743
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,210
yours

744
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:01,410
and my school work for proposals and the
same as

745
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,450
as somebody else's I also but they might
not notice

746
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:10,500
I mean they've been up since 530 morning
but if you wanna be picky

747
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,640
and we like to be picky you gotta put
that

748
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,440
that security Inc back well you can't
fight

749
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,660
there are a couple of places where you
can get a hold of the yellow ink

750
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:23,830
for the red ink in small

751
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:27,900
quantities the black is really really
hard to come by

752
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,640
so once again in our world if you can't
buy it how do you get it

753
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,670
you make yourself we need our

754
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:38,540
with the absolutely cheapest color
inkjet cartridge we could find

755
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:45,540
at the local CBS you see another name
for the security is composite

756
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,760
I'm this is an ugly splotch I know

757
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,250
I gotta C plus an art of the point is
that the prof a concept

758
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,130
that is invisible to the scanner and
that was accepted as authentic but both

759
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:02,080
the scanners and you know what this is

760
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,490
this inc.'s this is the stuff you're
home inkjet printer makes

761
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:10,180
when you run out a black it just takes
to the color inkjet cartridge

762
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:13,200
it mixes all the colors it together and
all I did was to the paintbrush in all

763
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,740
the holes

764
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,470
and smear it around and that security

765
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:24,230
so

766
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,910
so what did we learn from all of this
the first thing that we learned is that

767
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:30,379
the surf

768
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:34,690
certification procedures in place to
guarantee that that book

769
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,050
vendors voting machines and the whole
systems are secure just

770
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:42,579
doc you know these procedures are by the
comments

771
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:47,200
in the same format to the variables
following naming convention is there

772
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,740
only one return statement per function
I've

773
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:57,740
don't see how that enhances the security
at all the second thing that we learnt

774
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,910
is that the security of the system

775
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:05,440
that is intended or needs to be secure

776
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:09,680
can't be added on as an afterthought you
can't just

777
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,368
at a couple blocks and a seal and for
what password

778
00:47:13,369 --> 00:47:17,940
in and claim that the system secure

779
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,640
if you need it to be secure then you've
got

780
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,839
to design security in from its inception
up by the way

781
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:31,029
com the touch-screen voting machines
have hard could it asked

782
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,400
we found the comment next to a
hard-coded password that said

783
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,450
I kid you not this comment said

784
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:42,710
we hardcoded this so that hackers could
used

785
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:49,710
I

786
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:51,660
you can't make this stuff up

787
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:58,660
the third thing that we learned is that

788
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:04,690
well we weren't the only ones looking at
the system along with the Academic Teams

789
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:08,359
Ohio hired arm a group of commercial

790
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:12,069
software testers and they have

791
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:15,339
a methodology and they've got a business
that that goes around it

792
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:19,099
trying to determine the security if
thats us of our systems and

793
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:24,299
they didn't find anything that we didn't
find but we found a lot

794
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:28,259
dade so why did our ad hoc thrown
together

795
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,660
of method find so much more than they
did

796
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,899
we think it's because we approach it
like akers

797
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,940
we sat down

798
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,150
every one of us with our little piece
and we basically said

799
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:48,089
had my tax system if I

800
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:51,538
if I can get it here

801
00:48:51,539 --> 00:48:55,150
which we didn't move and what does that
tell me and

802
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:58,200
it allowed us to go off on tangents

803
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,760
if it looked interesting and that allow
us to make some of our our best fights

804
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:07,910
for example the pollen pet him later the
first thing we noticed we unbox

805
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,960
that touch screen is that there's no on
off switch but if you stick that little

806
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,799
box in that little

807
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:16,880
what the machine comes on okay there's a
switch in there somewhere

808
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,809
if you put the wrong one and it comes on
but it gives you an error message wrong

809
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:25,650
at on so that these are some
communication going on and so the next

810
00:49:25,650 --> 00:49:26,059
step

811
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:32,150
was just right to try and decode that
communication another example

812
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:35,930
is is finding the ballots the the reason
we felt we could for droughts

813
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:39,259
was because we try to make a photocopy
and we sent it through

814
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:42,660
and it spit it out said possibly
counterfeit

815
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,730
so we thought okay the paper Arthur same
color the

816
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:49,260
wait this is paper this card stock

817
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,799
on but looking closely at the ballot

818
00:49:52,799 --> 00:49:56,770
you could see that some boxes didn't
look exactly the same

819
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,910
fuzzier not quite as clear okay what
does that mean

820
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,359
and that tangent lettuce

821
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:08,400
to that and then the one I think that we
did

822
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,660
is that we stepped back and looked at
this not

823
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,180
as this problem with this machine in
this problem with that but as pieces of

824
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,328
an entire system

825
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:22,859
and we were able to to to find

826
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:26,859
are major discovery data viral
propagation

827
00:50:26,859 --> 00:50:30,750
because we said we've got a
vulnerability here

828
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,910
we've got this piece of the puzzle how
do we use act

829
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:38,379
to attack and so the fourth

830
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:41,920
discovery and this is the most important
is that

831
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,059
we were able to to actually demonstrate
up

832
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:50,990
an attack that a single person a single
voter could do a single machine

833
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,289
that would virally propagate all the way
back to

834
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:58,559
the election central headquarters of the
county

835
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,520
and Vic what this means is that

836
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:08,750
not only could an attacker change to
vote on one machine

837
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:13,250
not only could a malicious poll worker
alter the results for precinct

838
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:16,529
but one person in one poll done for the
precinct

839
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:21,339
somewhere in in the middle of nowhere
can upload

840
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:25,259
malicious code onto a machine which will
then write itself onto the removable

841
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:25,819
media

842
00:51:25,819 --> 00:51:29,150
which at the end if the election gets
taken out that voting machine

843
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,329
and sent back to the headquarters
wickets put into that

844
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:36,099
Windows box running the election
management software were it takes a

845
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:36,760
tentative

846
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,839
a number of vulnerabilities right to
self that and thereby

847
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:44,960
alters the result for the election at
the entire county and if you don't think

848
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,700
that's important

849
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:50,270
please remember that in 2004 the entire
country

850
00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:53,700
we did to find the results who got
Ohio's

851
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,059
electoral votes and who Kyle hires for
that electro vote

852
00:51:58,059 --> 00:52:01,720
depending on the results of Cuyahoga
County one

853
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,930
single county made all the difference in
who became president

854
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,990
so you know it's true what they say

855
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:15,990
one voter really can make a difference
now

856
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,809
so this is not

857
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:28,049
part of our mix mandate our country Ohio
but it is kinda

858
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:32,259
and educated up opinion ours what do we
do about this

859
00:52:32,259 --> 00:52:37,180
we're going to have to be really careful

860
00:52:37,180 --> 00:52:42,239
these machines are in use right now and
they will be in use in November

861
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:45,690
no we are hearing from a number of
places

862
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,759
Ohio for one is getting rid their touch
screens we've

863
00:52:49,759 --> 00:52:53,029
got a request from Texas of all places

864
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:56,059
to send them a report about which
optical scanners

865
00:52:56,059 --> 00:52:59,130
would be better than our opinion on the
optical scanners

866
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:03,049
because they want to get rid of their
their tax rates Texas of all places

867
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:07,650
for maybe we're making a difference here
I'm but

868
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:11,849
in in the short term all we can really
do is be very careful

869
00:53:11,849 --> 00:53:14,920
so I would like to I'm ass olive you who

870
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:19,619
are voting age and US citizens to become
poll workers

871
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:24,499
your next election I'm your

872
00:53:24,499 --> 00:53:28,549
counties in your precinct need you most
coworkers are geriatric

873
00:53:28,549 --> 00:53:31,869
and wouldn't recognize a problem with a
sulit on

874
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:36,849
at least your technical expertise could
be of use in the long term

875
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:40,680
we've got to build a better mousetrap
and

876
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,680
that sort

877
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:01,750
use the mic please

878
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:08,750
speaker social security

879
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:18,140
social security's all f's which I assume
is true for everyone

880
00:54:18,140 --> 00:54:21,970
arm I participated in the

881
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:24,970
accessibility testing up election

882
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:29,590
machines in California hocker for the
top to bottom yeah and the and the

883
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,350
subsequent one

884
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,029
and one of the things we found it's an
interesting sidelight

885
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,590
is that the audio interface were line

886
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:42,590
voter is I'm unintentionally one assumes
being broadcast over

887
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:46,010
RF so that almost any distance we are
offering

888
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,710
good listen in to what the person's
hearing heroes

889
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:52,980
right so thats that's the exact

890
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,890
right and so you cannot wonder what else
is going

891
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:00,680
available over our effort I guess my my
point is that

892
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,940
we found massive inaccessibility between
so

893
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,930
to the extent that the disabled
community is being used this something I

894
00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:08,310
was talking wars your

895
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:11,710
you just go yeah for driving the

896
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:16,010
that the Aria if there is a very very
interesting call option

897
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:19,230
of the disable community ride

898
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:23,490
voting right and that's my point is that
you know that there's a there's a

899
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:27,880
certain amount of hardening of attitudes
on both sides and it perhaps

900
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,490
time hand to consider convening

901
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:36,490
more conciliatory workshops between
those two communities that we can find

902
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:39,810
common ground people with disabilities
are citizens as well

903
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,400
know if they they want securing
accurately right think

904
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:49,420
you probably know about a writer named
Greg Palast

905
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,890
did quite the expose on what went down
in Florida and 2000

906
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:57,970
and I spoke to him yesterday and he
cautions

907
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:03,040
that a pop possibly even bigger problem
than I guess what you're talking about

908
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,060
be the equivalent black boxes and
recording the votes

909
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,330
is now EF in Athen the same companies

910
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:14,759
have been hired to actually and voter
registration applications

911
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,540
and they kept decide whose accepted who
isn't in the Interfaith

912
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:23,610
with people's social security record yes
and whether or not they certainly have

913
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:25,050
turned into an is illegal

914
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:28,820
immigrant even if they were born here we
actually have preferred that because

915
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,440
it's been done in Philadelphia right now

916
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,370
but that this said and so as far as
solutions

917
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:39,609
go one thing might be to start with
Barack Obama go all the way down the

918
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,440
chain to people running for office

919
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:46,740
and put a verbal blowtorch up her ass to
start talking about voting fraud and

920
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,790
coming out against the Islamic thing I
honestly just point out

921
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,950
what a weird things that happen is that
somehow

922
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,270
problems with voting machines got
identified as

923
00:56:56,270 --> 00:57:01,430
a democrat issue and problems with voter
registrations has been identified as a

924
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:02,760
republican issue

925
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,010
and it it became kinda senselessly
partisan because this doesn't actually

926
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,200
obviously affect one party or the other

927
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,510
so parked on you know it ended up
becoming

928
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,150
polarize both between vendors in the
disabled community

929
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,730
and also between Republicans and
Democrats in ways that have made it very

930
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:20,730
difficult

931
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,230
to make progress that's starting to thaw
considerably

932
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:27,850
on so maybe we'll see some progress on
that point

933
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:31,330
on also point out one other one other
quick thing I should mention before

934
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,770
the properties of an election is that
there's a loser

935
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:38,780
right the point to the election is not
just to figure out who won

936
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,840
but is to convince the loser and the
loser supporter

937
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:45,320
it's that they lost to the extent that
there are these problems with voting

938
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:45,980
machines

939
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,010
makes it a lot harder to convince the
loser

940
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:52,480
to go away so these problems even if
they're not being

941
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,810
actually exploited the fact that their
present

942
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:59,150
is gonna seriously compromise confidence
in elections

943
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:02,360
so I think you get the last word what's
wrong with the

944
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,620
New York State voting machines at that
just that simple lever machines

945
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,799
mechanical

946
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,200
so that so the quick answer that is new
york the smart thing

947
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,310
never bought any America Vote Act and
now

948
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:18,410
but as the the downside to that is they
haven't actually been manufactured for

949
00:58:18,410 --> 00:58:20,020
something like forty five years

950
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,690
and there's like one guy with duct tape
knows how to repair them

951
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:29,320
on so at some point they're gonna need
to replaced thanks

952
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:36,320
thanks

953
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:55,270
and F in a few minutes will be our next
%uh discussion at called Wikipedia

954
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,950
you'll never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy
