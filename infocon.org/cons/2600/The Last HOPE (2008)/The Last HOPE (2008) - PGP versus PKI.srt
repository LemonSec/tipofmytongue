1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,260
vitamin retirement retirement sorry

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,799
against you earnings standards I don't
even

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,469
yeah marriage is great law radovan

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,129
with PGP verses PK I up

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,210
okay so it's getting it started

6
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,240
this is PTV versus picky I I would
assume that you know some basics

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,210
I'm not gonna go over any kind of real
detail and we could talk for free

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,270
few protect me I've got some links on
books

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,980
and web sites that you can look at for
all in agreement medical details

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:41,850
%uh we're really gonna concentrate on
the trust issues and their relationships

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,590
with NPK I'm pgp to whom I

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,530
right now I am the director of security
assessments at gen-i security solutions

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,930
we are a security consulting firm in the
Washington DC metro area

14
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,870
%uh yet director doesn't mean much we
got seven people the company

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,930
so you just a fancy title I've
participated in the FA Trophy Cam

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,720
working group

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,870
thanks to be in the DC area the US
federal government has one of the

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,620
largest pecan pies in the world

19
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,229
thanks to the department of defense and
the federal bridge we provide consulting

20
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:15,770
services for very large enterprises with
pecan ice

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,979
arm summer who actually rival federal

22
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:23,590
federal a PK I for size I'm a number
certificates issued other most that has

23
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:25,220
to do with lost tokens and

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,530
broken tokens rather than actual size

25
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,200
%uh I do occasionally depend testing
still I'd rather him or a bit by

26
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
have my background is in pen testing
unfortunately kinda move to the middle

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,869
management

28
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:41,140
by it it pays more and which each

29
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,530
started a family to support %uh and also
you know I do have a

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,729
masur science and information ever come
from Carnegie Mellon the

31
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,330
I and II program which is now an NSA
approved

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:56,600
security program which what my opinion
doesn't mean much

33
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,720
you so when you talk about

34
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,600
real quick public key cryptography I
some other key management

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,139
p2p it became pgp and DVD I'm primarily
focusing on OpenPGP

36
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,999
which is the open standard issues now
I'm in the same with PK I and then why

37
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,340
would you choose one over the other

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,529
each has its strengths and weaknesses
and what are they

39
00:02:17,529 --> 00:02:20,799
so publicly to talk for free

40
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:24,950
has you get two keys Republican your
private their mathematically related

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,639
are basically you have trapped or
functions which are one-way functions

42
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,849
that have a key to go back the other way
basically

43
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,418
if you know the public key it's very
very difficult

44
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,959
mathematically and computational needs a
lot of computational power

45
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,340
to get the private key even though they
are related so

46
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,409
it is possible arm but with key links
that are in use today 1024 2048

47
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,200
very very very difficult other keeps
getting easier

48
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,639
every month as we get more as we get
more computing power there's or other

49
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,650
them center in use

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,379
our essay is based on competing factors
Desa an album out

51
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,888
are based on computing logarithms both
of which are complex problems

52
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:11,590
so just the other than you use just a
case what problem you're trying to solve

53
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,489
basic premise is that one key

54
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,620
undoes whatever the other one does so if
you encrypt with your private key

55
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,029
you encrypt with the public key your
crib with your public key you encrypt

56
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,029
your private key

57
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:29,930
so that's basically the relationship
with your public and private keys

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,219
if you want more very detailed
information on public he could talk for

59
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:34,638
free

60
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,779
the hamburger but I could talk free is
free online I have the URL

61
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:42,409
and actually I check my boss is if I can
upload these to our server

62
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:46,519
after the year after the talk and you
guys down to the slides

63
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,139
um also the prosecutor book

64
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,699
with onions Ferguson a brief shining
bozos

65
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,269
you know I actually recommend the
product could talk if you look over the

66
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:56,719
implied

67
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:00,719
photography book because he applied for
Tiger fee is how to implement them

68
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,079
where's the practical photography tells
you you know what the background how are

69
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,639
they were developed and things like that
so for people who are just interested in

70
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,989
learning about the could talk for free I
recommend cock

71
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,239
Murphy you when implemented go for it go
for the Red Book to public key

72
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,980
cryptography is little different from
symmetric key a TSX Adara

73
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,340
because allows for digital signatures
you basically you sign me

74
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,640
you signed the private key and that's
your signature

75
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,890
a lesser message integrity use hashes

76
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,469
with your IP signing passions with the
private key people can tell if your

77
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,700
message is changed or not

78
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,280
on also it sober supports key exchange

79
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,750
um most public he could talk free
actually

80
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,930
we exchanging emails somebody using one
of these methods

81
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,620
you're actually not encrypting it
asymmetrically or cooking at securing

82
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,430
Christine

83
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,980
a key asymmetrically people D Kripke and
then use that symmetric key

84
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,060
to pick up the rest the message so

85
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,400
just because the metric is still faster
and public public he could have you what

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,790
you do is exchange all these keys in

87
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,940
in with in bad in bands manner you don't
have to call somebody on the phone and

88
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,140
say what's your key

89
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,039
you can be you know publicly on a
webpage key server whatever

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,150
us additional soldiers are using private
key encrypt them

91
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:24,170
I using compassion not the actual entire
message

92
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,020
Fresno on a PDA Shin I send you a
message signs

93
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,210
I can't later say that no I didn't send
because theoretically I'm the only one

94
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,799
who has my private key

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,590
and since that's a sign is my private
key I said

96
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,070
and as a message integrity so people
check the hashes

97
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,380
hashes don't are exact then the message
changed in some way

98
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,600
either start to be issues with that with
collisions in Shaw 1

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,630
so as of now can't do known

100
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,080
collisions but in the future may be able
to

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,240
so how do we share our public keys given
to your friends

102
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,380
cigarette USB stick publish my webpage

103
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,940
use key search PHP Q servers now so you
can also use X 500 held up directories

104
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,070
and all these ways you can share any

105
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,200
publickey PDP or PK I

106
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,330
and the public so your keys a public

107
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,250
does not matter who has them separate
one case when you wonder about them

108
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:28,160
so but what about all the public use
that you've collected

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,260
are yours you know if your friends are
the ones you download it

110
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,300
how do you know that the person that you
have

111
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,560
public e4 has the corresponding private
key

112
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,740
and is who you think you are well this
is how pgp Invacare different

113
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,780
they deal with this differently for PDP

114
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,950
and I said this is OpenPGP mostly pretty
good privacy

115
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,930
1991 by Phil Zimmermann I it's changed
quite a bit

116
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,190
since he created it others really to big

117
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,420
changes starting with 26 earlier and 26
and later

118
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,080
I'm have quite different algorithms
renounce and by the PTP preparation

119
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,889
which actually does

120
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,310
still dies published pgp

121
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,540
software desktop enterprise level
software

122
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:21,880
OpenPGP US 90 F working group created in
1987 so that PGP stayed open and did not

123
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,570
have problems with Network Associates
just not wanting to deal with that

124
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,409
on RC's 48 eighty and 3156

125
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,190
are the Tuaregs seize the deal with the
PDP if you want more details

126
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,530
and like I said earlier i'm talking
about. OpenPGP so which is the %uh stand

127
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,810
ETF standard so both MPTP NPP

128
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,230
PGP Corporation support the traditional
Web of Trust

129
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,630
method you know it they also actually
support a hierarchical model

130
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,210
I was talking to some friends earlier
and they had no clue the p2p could do

131
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,030
some stuff about talk did

132
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,860
you know it's is in the code he should
have been a key ring

133
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,070
I you have at least two one private one
public he can also have multiple

134
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,219
however you choose it mostly boastful
accuser exchanging some kind ad hoc

135
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,380
manner

136
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,480
he servers web pages so

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:18,639
like I said yet he servers and you to
use likes what he server you want to use

138
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,470
this is an example of the trusts created
using sick to die

139
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,010
this is mine and the kind of cluster in
the middle there's actually from the

140
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:26,310
hope

141
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,570
2004 key signing party seeking to see

142
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,669
you know raise in a related there and
then I've also

143
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,558
you know like said you know what college
did master seeks kinda other group of

144
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:37,179
friends

145
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,289
but I hang out with um when you validate
an icky

146
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,339
with pgp and this is you know you have
to use it

147
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,559
as to send somebody a cryptic message or
to check their signature

148
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,819
there's four levels of trust and this is
a using up the trustee me commands

149
00:08:53,819 --> 00:08:57,029
in a GPG if you don't trust them

150
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,600
you know if you trust them if marginal
trust are you fully trust them

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,769
by default your own key is a fully
trusted you on the private key

152
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:10,350
everybody else by default is don't know
if you actually use update

153
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,069
trustee v you can set in order to
validate a key

154
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:18,709
YouTube he requires enough ballot keys
or

155
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,379
and blacks ans the key be invalidated
must be within five keys

156
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:27,360
your own now these a DVD defaults you
can change them

157
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,459
eighty-plus requiring wanna Kiev
directly site

158
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,809
so if you signed your friends key it
trust fully

159
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:39,230
one fully valid he must have trusted so
if you're you fully trust a friend

160
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,189
they sign a key you'll trust or you have
to have three marginally alan keyes

161
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:48,160
sign in so you marginally trust three of
your friends

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,779
and those three friends have signed a
key then it's going to be fully trusted

163
00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,379
says example here you know have Alice
Bob and Charley

164
00:09:56,379 --> 00:09:59,579
are people I've signed and

165
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:02,759
I marginally trust idle you know

166
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:05,999
for whatever reason I don't press and
check ID's I just

167
00:10:05,999 --> 00:10:09,740
Martelly trust they're they're okay
people but I'm not going to trust them

168
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,129
to

169
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,990
sign for me in check ID's so all three
of them signed an

170
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,360
I'm gonna considered and a valid key but
only Bob and Charley inside Eve

171
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,420
so I'm not consider even valid key

172
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,110
and that's about how GPD doesn't

173
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:30,410
so what happens you know you have these
little keys where do you find them

174
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,719
I've signed Allison also signed bobbin
bobbin signs Charlie

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,740
where do I find the link between Allison
Charlie

176
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,449
I don't know who bobbitt's how do I find
his key

177
00:10:42,449 --> 00:10:45,680
well yes it really sends me a sign email

178
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,459
I don't know where it rested or not
because I don't know who bob is

179
00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:52,649
I have to find somebody has to tell me

180
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,730
about Bob ski so I can have it in my
keyring

181
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,019
you know you have to ask alice about it
I access Charlie

182
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:04,410
who he thinks might lead back to me is
really no

183
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,189
good way a building pass with PGP

184
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:11,459
yes it's on your keyring you can build
the path but if you don't have these

185
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:12,850
people on your keyring

186
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,829
you not be able to build that path this
kind of this is where the major problems

187
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,040
with the decentralized love trust

188
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,748
is that there's no go to place to get
all these keys

189
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:27,350
he said you know most major CAE servers
are linked together but not all about

190
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:31,540
so what if I use once a key servers and
charlie season another said accusers

191
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,019
I'll never find

192
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,089
so another thing that OpenPGP supports
is actually it does support a

193
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,499
hierarchical model

194
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:45,699
most people use the webcast live trust
mile I'm like I've said

195
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:48,800
I have talked to some friends who use
pgp for ever they didn't even know the

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,009
option existed

197
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,089
there's no central authority you you are
the central authority

198
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:00,420
for your weather trust so I decide how
much time i trust icky

199
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,429
and I decide how many how I decided went

200
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,850
Howell what I'm gonna require from
people for me to sign their key

201
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,879
so if I want your passport to sign your
key

202
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,990
that's my standard but how many people
want a passport psyche

203
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:18,389
you know that there's no standards
identity verification

204
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,300
could be I know bob over in q3 okay
because I'm up ski

205
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,019
wheres my company never seen again
actually works for a company

206
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:29,100
you know okay so basically

207
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,160
you know there's two types of things in
a p2p signature that everybody knows

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,769
you just sign it uploaded to key server
you know trusted

209
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,990
fully largely are you don't trust it
where the case may be

210
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,050
so when I psyche I'm saying that I have
verified this person's identity

211
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,439
whatever my idea verifying its

212
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,800
so I'm I trust my friends to verify it
somebody else

213
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,160
so there are a few friends I trust check
ID's and there are some that

214
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,170
I don't ans you know

215
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:03,220
once it's gone past my group of friends
I don't know what standards

216
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,220
identity are

217
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,189
Canada really end up with the one little
change you to your friends

218
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:15,059
maybe one more one person middle

219
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,769
so but and like cases yet a key same
party

220
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,309
have two people on the my web address
for the Hokies same pretty

221
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,600
never seen him before never seen them
since

222
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,050
but I take their ID if he say Murray I
was I signed their key

223
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,319
I don't know who they are I don't know
that I can trust them to sign other

224
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:34,079
people's keys appropriately

225
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,759
yes they did the same party but does
that mean they do it all the time

226
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,759
Anna so you can't extender trust very
far

227
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,439
you can't have two get added your group
love

228
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:48,959
close friends good other groups get a
different love you go to a different

229
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,470
2600 meeting in our six panorama pressed

230
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,759
but was the people I know aren't
terribly comfortable doing that

231
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,029
cars talking to people I'm

232
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:05,670
check so the other kind of signature and
he did his trust signatures

233
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,610
it's not address command you can only do
it for the Edit he commands multi-site

234
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,379
and I'm not sure if you guys can read my
my a screen capture their

235
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:18,059
that's actually what happens when you do
it he signed on its key

236
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,610
ask you to trust them are Julie Reed you
trust them fully

237
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,910
and ask you the depth of trust how far
do you trust this person

238
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,509
it can be you know 0 or it can be you
know

239
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:35,459
500 whatever you want the

240
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,809
0 means you don't trust at all one means
you trust them

241
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:43,469
but you don't trust them to trust check
identities anything above

242
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,550
wind means you trust them to check
entities and whoever

243
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,749
they sign a check it it's it's basically
a a measure of how far you trust people

244
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,980
how far down the path you're willing to
trust people

245
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,339
you can also restricted by doing so if I
say

246
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,610
I trust up bob from Company A to sign
all Company A's

247
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,589
a data works I'm signatures I can say
okay bob can only sign a dorkus

248
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,920
So You Think You Can restricted by to me

249
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,649
but basically when you do sign it was
the trust signature you're saying

250
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,589
you trust this person to verify somebody
else's identity for you

251
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,839
you also a allow them to make signatures
on your behalf

252
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,439
basically so you know when PDP makes it
past

253
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:32,509
filling algorithm and takes you and your
friend button together

254
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:36,069
there's no you know it's basically the
same thing

255
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,160
as far as the p2p is concerned path
length obviously changes

256
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,209
um you just become a CA

257
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:46,879
up sites you come here in CA I as a
near-death

258
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,449
tells you how far you trust your friends
friends so

259
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,489
I send somebody that's a depth one they
send somebody else's. adaptive to

260
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:58,929
and so on that this measure change
thanks

261
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,720
any revocation the PDP up for CF
actually generate revocation

262
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,110
the canoe PG manual recommends you do it
as soon as you generate your actual key

263
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,449
I don't know too many people who do and
if they do they have no clue where they

264
00:16:12,449 --> 00:16:15,459
saved it when they actually need it

265
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,819
so and when you've lost the key and you
haven't ever generators revocation

266
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:20,100
information

267
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,119
you can't you no longer have the private
key you can revoke your key

268
00:16:24,119 --> 00:16:26,249
even though you know it's been
compromised suspect it's been

269
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,670
compromised

270
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,540
you and only you can revoke your
certificate

271
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,290
I can revoke a certificate for you even
though I know you lied to me

272
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:38,980
I can revoke my signature on your
certificate

273
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,249
there's only there's only two commands
that won't let you and that's and our

274
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:44,939
sin and RT sign

275
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:48,549
and he's not a vocal signature
non-verbal trust signature

276
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,259
and if you use those I pity you you
should always be able to revoke your

277
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,759
trust in your friends

278
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,220
no matter how good friends there

279
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,819
yes I have an issue with publishing a
revocation information how do you tell

280
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:04,459
all these people that may have your key
you have no clue who educate because you

281
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:06,290
put in a public place

282
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,349
that your doctor's your key yeah I

283
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:13,480
put it on your any website put on the
key servers and it's not a key server

284
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:16,790
most people are likely gonna pick it up
assuming they refresher keys every once

285
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,750
in a while

286
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,869
by it if somebody is talented of your
website much you really go back through

287
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:25,060
56 years weblogs how do you know who's
downloaded

288
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,450
seek notified them and

289
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:32,850
you know when you upload it you don't
know who has actually site you made it

290
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,330
may or may not know who signed a key

291
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,800
it's likely because you probably had a
show your identity to them

292
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,830
but that's not always the case I have
actually seen people who've randomly

293
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,990
psyches

294
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,350
he servers just because the name looked
familiar

295
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,590
I'll so how do you tell these people
that have signed rookie that you were

296
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,179
able to keep

297
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,560
he's no longer good so he serves the
best method right now

298
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,610
well what's the problem with the TV
lacquer standards

299
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,360
for identity verification you know in
the US

300
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,710
driver's license passport

301
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,920
school ID her company ID maybe

302
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:14,680
you know what do you find acceptable may
not be what I find acceptable

303
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,070
you know how do you know what other
people are doing further down the chain

304
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,750
you trust you trust sign some money how
do you know what their identity

305
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,640
standards are

306
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,990
you have new contract with them to hold
them to the standards

307
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,230
so if they just most the time I checked
identities and then just that one of

308
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,890
time they don't

309
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,140
you know it's kinda a trust issue with
your friends

310
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,280
reefer trust is shaky you know when you
when you say

311
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,490
somebody else can act on my behalf in
all situations

312
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,890
legal in the real world online Dec
cetera

313
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,390
you have issues you know a you no longer
have

314
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,070
om you no longer have control over your
key and what your trust this

315
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,300
you basically publishing said I trust
this person to

316
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:01,350
act as me you know and if for some
reason you

317
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:04,480
get upset have a fight whatever

318
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,780
you have no clue what they're gonna do
now

319
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,410
thing is that pair that person's likely
never ever use a trusting nature

320
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,140
facts how many people here have actually
used trust signatures

321
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,450
in Fiji beer GPD get to 3

322
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,540
for people a group maybe 50-60

323
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,300
so coming up heard about them before now
you

324
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,399
okay quite a few more so

325
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,800
I guess that is really not that popular

326
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,840
but PDP is a very flexible model you
have control over

327
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,750
your little gir and you can trust or not
trust the man who choose

328
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,200
still have problems if I need he's in
the middle between you and whoever is

329
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,210
sent us a message

330
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:53,540
elsa revocation indications a pretty big
issue

331
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,340
yeah I actually solves a lot of these
and brings its own problems

332
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,080
so it begins public key infrastructure
it's a base RFC 5280

333
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,330
which just came out this may I you guys
probably more familiar 3280

334
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:10,159
which is the previous version x5
inaccessible X 59 the ANSI standard

335
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,360
I use the certificates you can actually
use hardware tokens

336
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,210
and if anybody knows I've heard her
talking for PGP and like to hear about

337
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,140
it

338
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,860
I don't know one and if there is one I'd
be great because I'd like something that

339
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,700
can store both my PGP key ring and my

340
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,340
hardware certificates on the same token
your certificate policies

341
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,360
and you have directories as well kinda
comes as part of the whole

342
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,670
infrastructure part it's primarily
hierarchical model

343
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,610
it does actually support a Web of Trust
like model using cross certificates but

344
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,450
that has

345
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,810
really big interoperability challenges
%uh

346
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:48,440
certificates are public keys that have
been signed by another entity

347
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,800
so want somebody assigned here your
public you become certificate

348
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,850
whoever whoever signed it doesn't matter

349
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,060
Certification Authorities actually issue
certificates

350
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,429
so they can issue certificates to other
certification authorities make an issue

351
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,690
end-users use people like you and me

352
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,170
a root CA is a special type of CA that
has a self-signed certificate

353
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,750
this is the ultimate trust through a
hierarchy

354
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,040
so this is the kinda machine that's a
you know most of them

355
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,129
no network now reports actually a pox it
closed

356
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:25,200
there start offline stored in a safe %uh

357
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,510
a lot of them use harbors her security
modules that have 45

358
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:34,370
key cards an order to boot up the
machine you actually have to have

359
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,560
safe three of the five yr for the five
keys in order even boot up the machine

360
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,000
used the keys for these

361
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,400
so they're they're quite there there
there though weak spot in the higher

362
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,020
in the trust hierarchy yes have
supported CA's

363
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,930
these are Certification Authorities
don't have a self-signed certificate

364
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,930
or where the self-signed certificate
does not and two is a certification path

365
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,840
I'm a CA foreign and you can have
multiple certificates

366
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,070
issued by multiple issuers I'm so it
makes an interesting graphic Jer

367
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,500
a validation path is a chain all
certificates

368
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,430
from one that you trust to the one
you're trying to verify

369
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:16,890
validate so now it has to go back to a
brute CA that you trust

370
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,800
so validation passerby completely
different for everybody because not

371
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,850
every trust the same

372
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,030
CS any also have the revocation list
also known as a CRL

373
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,639
to list them all certificates that a
particular CA has revoked

374
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,620
so this is the publication method to the
interesting parts in X 59 certificate

375
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,240
on the required parts are subject
anarchy

376
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,140
issuer and their public key a validity
period

377
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,720
so how long is a good for one disturbing
goodwin's and being good

378
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,710
and a CRL distribution point where am I
gonna find revocation information about

379
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,070
the certificate

380
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,980
certainly interesting optional parts are
key usage an extended key usage

381
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,060
I can tell when I sign a certificate as
a CA

382
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,450
I can say this review is only good for
encryption the certificate only get

383
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,590
additional sighing

384
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,919
thus it is only good for authentication
and there's also the code signing

385
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,150
certificates or something you might be
familiar with

386
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:14,890
certificate palaces are also optional I
can assign a policy

387
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,720
to a certificate saying this certificate
follows this particular policy

388
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,470
and I talk a little bit more about
policies later but this is basically the

389
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,140
rules

390
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:27,370
at the CNN the other interesting part is
the authority information access the AIA

391
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,430
field

392
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,180
this says where to find information
about the key that's lying to me

393
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,710
so it safe I have end user certificate

394
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,920
my AI in Miami I A is gonna have
information %uh CA that signed me

395
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,840
so can't go find this key as we solve
the many you know where to find the

396
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,929
middle keys from

397
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,700
general hierarchy has a root CA I like
is that usually offline

398
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,640
locked in a box right maybe once a year
to issue a CL

399
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,510
issues certificates associates these the
ones are actually online and doing all

400
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,610
the certificate issuance

401
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,480
the sub CA's issue to people or other
CA's I mean I've seen

402
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:11,850
as in Iraq is five or six deep I don't
know why but they have a 160

403
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:15,080
pass validation this is building the
path

404
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,929
yet to start you start with a
certificate that you're trying to verify

405
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,900
uses the issuer information the AIA
until finds one

406
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,900
until find some CA that you trust just
keep going back up the hierarchy

407
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,820
to find something that you trust then it
checks all the certificates and that

408
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,470
path

409
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,250
at least a good are they revoked
eccentric

410
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,760
can actually be quite a lot more
complicated than it sounds

411
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,990
graph problem um and

412
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,210
has cycles and it's so you're it's
actually because specifics to

413
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,330
659 you're actually talking about 3
spanning under them

414
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,639
so it's not a complete but it is
difficult um

415
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,340
but I S if you really want to learn
about past building %uh RC 4158 actually

416
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,320
tells you it to you how you must do it
but it tells you here's a really good

417
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,750
way to do it

418
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,530
and in fact most if the most mostaert

419
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,560
vendors who do you have validation
actually follow 4158

420
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:16,590
so so the key management picky I
supports key escrow

421
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,340
was key escrow store and storing your
key

422
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,540
CA keeps a copy of your key which is
good for

423
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,760
signing that's a good idea because then
you lose Nana Peth in

424
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,810
but when you're accepting you're working
for a company

425
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:36,100
and you have documents you like that
your hardware token

426
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,680
any really really need to get to this
document to send it here class

427
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,680
US the CA and say can I really pretty
please having

428
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,500
option key back I'm so that's one of the
reasons and the other reason is the Seya

429
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,030
companies so they can always on encrypt
what people have been corrupted in a

430
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,570
company

431
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,159
arm certificates are published in a
central directory

432
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,800
all c8 certificates are published
end-user certificates may or may not be

433
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,820
depend on how your how you set up your
structure

434
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:11,530
and that's just so that people can find
your CA certificates

435
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,240
Ana CA should have tried have published
and follow

436
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,370
estupida policy this and such a policy
there is actually a RFC that tell you

437
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,670
exactly what format it must be an

438
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,530
its has that that's 36 37 and that's
just so they can compare them

439
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,420
between CA's easily skies exactly how I
don't you verification is done

440
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,380
what ID's are acceptable how many pieces
a baby you must have

441
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,430
who is allowed to do the at any
verification

442
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,560
as well as how machines are identified
especially you know

443
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,950
pk has used for SSL Certificates how do
you identify machine

444
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,480
machine can't you know come up and show
you is ID

445
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,040
so most I'm actually have human sponsors
and human sponsor must do the utmost

446
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,710
you know they they actually identify the
human sponsor UN-sponsored yeah I'll

447
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,080
talk for this machine this EP is a
public document

448
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,159
anybody can read it so

449
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,100
like is that I have a link to Verisign
if you really want to read their signs

450
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:08,650
which

451
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:12,030
yeah unless you guys have been mucking
around in your trust fruit store

452
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,389
love either Microsoft ehrlich's you
trust us

453
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,690
just because it's there even Firefox
Mozilla have it

454
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,180
so you know it might be useful to read
up some the CP's is all the CA's

455
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,660
you trust and see what they're doing to
check people's identities

456
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,140
check certificates most CA's have yearly
audits

457
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,750
spire certificate policy they check you
know

458
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,200
this there's a big hug there's also some
call the certificate practice statement

459
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,280
which is okay here's how we need our
policy that I was never published

460
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,320
because has information about where
things are stored

461
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,270
what typeof algorithms are you said
kinda confidential information that

462
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,450
if what if it was leaked or shared

463
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:55,110
so they could easily break into the
system's so the almost never find those

464
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,640
online

465
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,670
%uh you can actually get a hold of them
if you have some kind of corporate

466
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,650
relationship

467
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,890
with the CA they are shared

468
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,510
but there's a yearly audit to say okay
does your CBS master CP

469
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,550
and then actually are you actually
following your practice statement

470
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,210
tonight following your policies

471
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,000
so when you trust to see a you can
actually request their audit

472
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,630
you might not get the details on the
idea but you at least get yes the eye

473
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,570
passed a guest

474
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,570
fails so you can say are the following
what their CP says

475
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:30,649
SEM E and I have a field trip auditing
their friends

476
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,740
yes

477
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,820
some other done by the company
themselves are most are actually

478
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,240
required to be done by third parties

479
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,760
you did accounting firms do it

480
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:51,030
our company actually does them um and
there's a lot of companies that do them

481
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,889
federal PTI has a whole list companies
that they will accept on its from

482
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,430
so it's really what you know

483
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,880
you wanna pick somebody in the third
party that you know other people trust

484
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,130
to do the on it properly summers always
an independent third-party audit

485
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,390
some other smaller CA's may do internal
audits I depends on what they're used

486
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:11,650
for

487
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,220
all the big CA's to third parties

488
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,510
I can talk about the root CA protections
%uh hardware security module these

489
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,970
things these old boxes that hold the key

490
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,540
so never actually in the computer some
of them have temperature and motion

491
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,440
control so if you bought that box you
just wiped out the key

492
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,780
arm so these things are like very well
protected

493
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,340
you log in more than like twice without
the right password got a lot going on in

494
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,650
just a race the key and

495
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,940
see you later root CA um

496
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:47,529
yes

497
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:50,789
scary she feels the temperature spikes

498
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,908
most most ritzy A's are actually offline

499
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:59,990
and you the cards that are required to
put up this hardware module

500
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,220
are in them so they actually aren't
using those protections

501
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,299
most the time except once put it up I

502
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:11,350
if you are actually running and HSM in a
environment that you expect the heat

503
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,870
despite

504
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,769
I you gonna leave your key there are
there are backups

505
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:19,690
depends on what vendor you by the ages
some from and things like that s

506
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:26,510
rate ESA

507
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,549
you guys have modern equipment let you
know beforehand

508
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:32,658
but basically if you get outside of the

509
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:35,870
approved operating conditions is the way
to key

510
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,029
its business so people can take the box
you outdoor

511
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:42,809
with it so MPTP

512
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,470
which has variable levels of trust you
the trustor don't trust

513
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,070
speaking I certificate there is no in
the middle there's no marginal trust

514
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,269
it's all for not just all pecans weapon
mod

515
00:30:55,269 --> 00:30:59,570
also known as Prosser to fight is one is
little boxes

516
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,939
you know bloop bloop PK I read picky I
green PK I

517
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,120
by different companies corporations her
you wanna magid

518
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,289
have decided to trust each other for
whatever reason eyes example say the

519
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:10,970
blue

520
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,169
certificate is air the blue CA is a the
is the FDA

521
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:18,809
and the red and green are a
pharmaceutical company

522
00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:23,200
who wants to work with the FDA to some
electronic documents

523
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,250
well they need to make some kind a trust
relationship it's a lot

524
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:30,260
for anybody who's on Windows
administration it's a lot like a cross

525
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,059
forest

526
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:36,668
trust but there's a lot love policies
and politics to go into it

527
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:40,220
where the problems are discussed
certifying

528
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,149
is that policies don't always match up
if you have one CA

529
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:47,260
who wants to peace is a vindication and
one CA who wants one piece

530
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,169
identification

531
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:52,120
this policy is not match up and you
actually not an issue across certificate

532
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:57,049
because you can't insure that your users
that you have the same identity

533
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:00,860
verification across-the-board ICA's have
multiple policies

534
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,669
so you can have like federal bridge has
four policies basic low medium high

535
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:10,980
and you actually can cross certify at
one or more of those levels depend on

536
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,789
how you

537
00:32:11,789 --> 00:32:15,129
define your certificate policy so that
kinda

538
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:19,340
helps the you know disparities and
identification

539
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,250
politics cross certifying with another
CA

540
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,490
just brings two organizations who may or
may not trust each other may or may not

541
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,570
like each other

542
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,779
together to try to figure all this out
and actually do the talking about the

543
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:34,370
technical part takes about five seconds

544
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:39,419
their estimate takes about 3-4 months to
actually go through across certification

545
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,220
I'll

546
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,440
pastel issue becomes much harder because
as you see there are no cycles in the

547
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:45,889
graph

548
00:32:45,889 --> 00:32:50,990
so you have to worry about the cycles
and there's also interoperability

549
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:51,690
problems

550
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,190
so there are multiple vendors have CA
software

551
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,659
Microsoft entrust be trusted chosen
security

552
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:02,110
take your pick there are multiple love
them they don't

553
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,419
all fall the spec big surprise

554
00:33:05,419 --> 00:33:09,510
um and in fact the specs not all that
detailed

555
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,990
there are some areas that are you have a
choice should me

556
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:18,019
you know must extra and we grow certify
you gotta work out all the technical

557
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:18,789
details

558
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:22,070
and make sure that 11 user on

559
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:26,110
PK i won you know wants to talk to peak
at to use user

560
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,950
that the actual gonna be able to build
the path gonna be able to talk to the

561
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,600
directories have begun a leveled

562
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,779
query the CRL 6 enter a say

563
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:37,960
you have major problems on the technical
like I said the technical issues

564
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,340
probably all that you can fully resolve
those in about a day or two

565
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,419
was a politics you still at months arm

566
00:33:44,419 --> 00:33:48,610
so why do you want I mean there are
major house across our two guests so why

567
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,460
do you wanna bother trying to use them

568
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,909
what very few people actually need to be
involved only the owners

569
00:33:54,909 --> 00:33:58,490
a PK I usually aboard %uh

570
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,940
Google owners once you know they really
want to have to be involved

571
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,570
they may bring some technical people and
answer questions and do the work but

572
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,168
most

573
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,230
is very few people are involved but
everybody as parties pick as benefits

574
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,560
from

575
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,520
it's not like 0 you know I did attack
every single person

576
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,839
because I want sexys like you wouldn't
believe me

577
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,069
just you know 45 people have to get
together actually do the work

578
00:34:21,069 --> 00:34:25,889
everybody trusts everybody policies are
matched to each other so that the

579
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,409
consistent

580
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:31,679
and I was talking about earlier the and
it is very cation is not the only thing

581
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,980
has been mapped

582
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,010
it's also the physical security in the
CAA's its CEO Tom

583
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,040
how you know how many keys are required
to bring up the hard or soft hardware

584
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,359
security module

585
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,929
you know that two keys at three easy to
keys at five

586
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:49,190
how do you bring that up all that stuff
has to be kinda ironed out me figured

587
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:52,089
out before you can get across
certification

588
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:56,250
but their maths eventually and so
everybody knows that I have a

589
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,380
certificate with this policy

590
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,520
its gonna map pretty evenly to somebody
with another policy

591
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,869
and you guys never even see this part
it's all done in the software

592
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,150
expands Web of Trust for each user

593
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,980
and healing have to do anything lets you
run the CIA

594
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,470
cell house revocation and he can

595
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,330
even the user or the CAA can actually
that the certificate

596
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:26,080
depends on the policies some CA policies
don't let the user about

597
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,490
certificate must be the CA that does it
varies wildly

598
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:35,160
how to find the revocation information
is right there in the certificate

599
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,740
CL distribution point I say I want the
revocation information for this

600
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,830
and you go to this all that turkey ready
to go to this web page

601
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:47,369
and give me the CRL the CA issue serials
on a regular basis

602
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:52,960
um you usually i've seen on a six hour
when no I've seen a month when know it

603
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,960
depends on how sensitive it is that the
certificates be

604
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,520
you know active you know if it's
somebody's revoked certificate

605
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,240
how long can you wait for you have a
problem so that you can change it varies

606
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,970
wildly

607
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:10,380
see rose can be huge

608
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,339
would you love to Dallas 6 make file
every time I checked some a certificate

609
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:18,480
see if they revoked or not yeah I do
this on a regular basis at work

610
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,849
because whatever clients as a six make
cl5

611
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:25,240
so what are the ways you can get around
that is OCSP online certificate status

612
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,130
protocol

613
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:29,960
said one little packets as is as good it
sends you a packet back it says yes

614
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,839
no you trust it's also signed by the CIA
and

615
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,109
by the OCSP responder so you don't have
you can't trust it

616
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:41,609
by default the CRL assigned by the way

617
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:45,900
so you know that it actually came from
the CA that issued

618
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,980
the user the key does not control the
revocation information

619
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,530
I can't say you know go to cat5

620
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:57,720
for my revocation information 1c4
actually signed by Mikey

621
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,859
its associated with that information
there

622
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:04,009
so the user can have circumvent

623
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:07,580
so why would you want to use pgp a peek
at through quick

624
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:11,348
season is set up anybody can do it not
that difficult

625
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,859
does not require entire infrastructure
here I

626
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:19,560
is calling infrastructure for a reason
you really need all Eve the Armenian

627
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,339
order for people to trust you read CA
you need to have those protections

628
00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:24,339
around

629
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:28,480
it's best suited for informal group
close group having points is

630
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,079
I anybody can become a CA is interesting
actors

631
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,000
so if you do wanna go the hierarchical
model you can it's there

632
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,720
just make sure you know what you're
doing make sure you really trust your

633
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,579
friends

634
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,280
make sure you trust your friends to
trust them if you're going to use this

635
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,640
the T sign

636
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,420
and if you want the variable trust you
gonna have to go PDP

637
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,670
there is no variable trust in BK Heights
if you do it that's important to you

638
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,880
you wanna use pgp so why would you want
to speak at

639
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:59,240
SSL I there is no free GPS is out

640
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,420
its it's also difficult based so

641
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,020
if you an SSL certificate you have to at
least be part of the a picky I and some

642
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,150
point

643
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,030
distribution keys certificates and trust
information to a very large number

644
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,810
users you talkin 20,000

645
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,440
hundred thousand five hundred thousand
users that you need to distribute this

646
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,990
information to

647
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,990
you're gonna wanna she's picky I because
you only have to worry about controlling

648
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,640
the route and maybe the subordinates

649
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,700
and you don't have to worry about you
know notify all these users

650
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:36,170
the things we vote because the
infrastructure takes care for you

651
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:39,349
you have more control over your
subordinates

652
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:42,510
so if you don't follow their policies
you can revoke them

653
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:48,210
service on my friend doc ski and I find
out he has been checking ID's

654
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,609
you know i cant it's very difficult I
can move my signature

655
00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:55,619
by it I it's difficult to publish that
information

656
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,160
so you know it's it's have a difficult
revoking the GP

657
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,899
PK I actually allows legal dockets I am
in both europe and the US

658
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,369
AP ki i've a signature from eighty
trusted CA

659
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:12,640
whatever you define as a trusted CA is
actually considered a legally binding

660
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,890
signature on a legal document so

661
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,549
that PDP does not share that status is
right now

662
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:23,849
so that's great for is that
pharmaceutical companies so many

663
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:27,250
clinical trial data to the FDA they can
sign it and say

664
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:31,599
yes I checked it I you know I support
this information sent the FDA

665
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,040
that is actually legally binding
signature

666
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,980
cell to have any participating pageview
GvG

667
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,839
download it you know Kennedy is probably
the most popular there are others

668
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,210
generated keys make friends start
signing

669
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:50,599
post key signing party I'm

670
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:53,420
you know I'd actually I'm not going to
sign a key because I haven't changed my

671
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:53,930
key

672
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,029
mean yet I just got married in change my
name so mikey has been changed yet for

673
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,010
PGP

674
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:03,619
you know tracing center means likes get
your getting friends together have a key

675
00:40:03,619 --> 00:40:05,330
saying hi it's not difficult

676
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,080
it's fine have a couple beers with it
beers and pizza

677
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,569
and then publish a key to a key services
you can use it

678
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:16,670
so happy participate began there's a
republic

679
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,920
keep PKS cáceres wanna

680
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,260
I V use it please donate I am not sure I
can assign a hundred points

681
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,299
so if you fill out the documentation I
can assure you if you find me later

682
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:31,339
basically you have to build up a certain
number of points by getting your

683
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:32,779
identity verified by

684
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:36,740
multiple people are by no trace in art I
actually went through the trusted

685
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,170
third-party model

686
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,950
where I had a good to know race they had
a check to pieces I T

687
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,260
and I had to send them off to Australia
to the state CA sur

688
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,930
they signed the 100 150 points which
makes me to share

689
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:53,660
and because I want to the process I can
now verify people's identities

690
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,339
are unfortunately I can't make you to
share I can only assign up to 35 points

691
00:40:58,339 --> 00:40:59,720
per person

692
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,220
so you have to find to other assures as
well

693
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,279
I'm if you know if you want to go
through that process you can go ahead

694
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:06,750
and

695
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,650
you can talk to me there you those also
the thought whether

696
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,660
trust I very similar concept but is from
my thoughts

697
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,640
you can get a peek at a certificate from
their sign for a fee I think it's

698
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,330
fifteen back

699
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:22,299
you see fifteen box $14.95 418 only
singer

700
00:41:22,299 --> 00:41:25,380
basically the check your email I'm in
the car charger 15 bucks for that

701
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,730
privilege

702
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,560
I and it goes progressively up from
there %uh if you want your

703
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,900
organizations verify Verisign

704
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,240
they're gonna charge about for five
thousand dollars

705
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,029
so but they really actually like jacks
off

706
00:41:41,029 --> 00:41:45,690
according to their CP up private no
private pecan ice

707
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,359
you can make your own open S l's a great
CA

708
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:52,450
not a very good interface but it works
um

709
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:56,140
unfortunately probably no reason to
trust you accept your friends

710
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,500
I is where most self signed certificates
on the internet come from

711
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,029
your player might have a peek at I of
you work for federal government

712
00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:06,599
I love the big pharmaceutical companies
have them a lot of defense contractors

713
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:07,380
have them

714
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,520
schools have for school employees

715
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:14,250
are and actually a lot of countries have
in Taiwan and China have their own you

716
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,390
guys for government

717
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,790
and so does Australia so you know

718
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,540
every also part of a trade or
professional organizations they may have

719
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,790
their own PK I

720
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,130
in order for you to get a certificate so
if you remember you check your

721
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:29,910
if you really want like a real pic and
certificate I don't pay Verisign your

722
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,299
couple hundred bucks

723
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:35,619
check with your employer your school you
know any professional organizations your

724
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:36,430
part have

725
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:40,859
and you they my house we can I they can
sign a certificate

726
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,660
cell any questions

727
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,910
yes

728
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:53,759
what happens in the CRL distribution
point changes basically

729
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:57,789
you get a I have no clue what the
revocation status is this certificate is

730
00:42:57,789 --> 00:43:02,079
I'm not going to trust it what most
people do is actually a big deal

731
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,569
wanna see LDP changes I'll of course

732
00:43:05,569 --> 00:43:09,900
you can change DNS you know you got it
she died hearing other shit up change

733
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,680
the DNS

734
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,359
that's one option but if for some reason
you know the name your organization

735
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:14,538
changed

736
00:43:14,539 --> 00:43:18,410
you have to reissue of the certificates
so

737
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,890
you would actually like what you
actually deploy enabling the PK I

738
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,180
you're probably gonna spend six months
to a year

739
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,379
thinking about all the stuff what
happens if zips

740
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,079
CLEP goes down what happens if the root
CA gets flooded out what happens

741
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:36,549
if the data center gets blown up
yen-dollar has stuff

742
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:39,940
you know basically backup disaster
recovery planning that worry about

743
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,759
so takes a lot of planning to do it in a
whole infrastructure

744
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:50,759
my son other hands

745
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,200
okay

746
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:11,779
okay so what you're saying is that there
are there's a a working group in the

747
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,650
ITTF

748
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,660
thats I will is using PGP for

749
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:19,149
can you tell us so if you examine that
like

750
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,280
you know the status is again a teacher

751
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,280
US fully supports so some back there

752
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:42,558
yes
