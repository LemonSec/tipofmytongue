1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:12,060
yeah

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,240
I good morning everybody I'm will get
started here

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,080
and %ah our topic today is %ah

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,330
contesting the web with Firefox her body
hear me

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:29,330
good are you great okay so

6
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,220
tried to make you know everybody you
want to speak an economy try to make an

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,320
interesting topic in you're probably
wondering

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,070
you know you read the abstract in 10
what's this thing about so who are we in

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,280
watts is really all about

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:47,230
I'll

11
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:51,240
my name's Michael shear present gates my
an O %ah

12
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,440
hour for breaks down and now

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,530
Maryland it's my job I used I was spent
on I am

14
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,440
little over eight years in the Navy I
was a EA 6p

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,559
a prowler electronic counter-measures
officer

16
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,610
I are also spent nine months on the
ground

17
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,320
yeah in iraq you doing a counter IED
work you may have seen me speak at Def

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,479
Con in Holborn

19
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,340
on the hacking I E dewey's I am

20
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,549
as with that time the last speaker have
also contributed to a couple of %uh

21
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,929
singer's books including two at once he

22
00:01:25,929 --> 00:01:30,440
mentioned penetration testers open
source toolkit volume 2

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,658
on netcat power tools which just came
out you know last month and also

24
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,190
kismet hacking which we coming out any
day now I'm also a I licensed amateur

25
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,380
radio operator

26
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,690
and active on a buncha forms that you
may be familiar with a net slumber Def

27
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,200
Con remote X platforms

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,490
%ah if that doesn't fill up enough my
time I tried to

29
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,950
coach football when I can and I have
three kids and a fourth on the way so

30
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,950
for keeping me busy and

31
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,000
good morning i'm john l former

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,830
my handle is da capo no up comes from a
number of years spent in Hawaii

33
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:17,760
like Mike I have the background a
military ID 24 years the US Navy

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,829
are I actually work for a living instead
of being an officer

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,890
of her so

36
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,670
so much my background has been a
telecommunications of I've worked with

37
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,739
everything from

38
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:33,409
HF UHF some VLF satellites

39
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,679
Morse code I'm also an amateur radio
operator

40
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,319
unlike might go I only have two children
the youngest which is 33% Swami empty

41
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:41,940
nester

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,109
and what I've managed to do is take Gav

43
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,330
a love for electronics a love for our

44
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,409
finding out how things work why things
work

45
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,530
how to break things what happened when
you take things that

46
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,280
are designed to do one thing and you ask
them to do something else

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,520
that's my term a packing and I'd managed
to

48
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,100
successfully put that into a career or I
am now

49
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,280
what might be considered to a lot of
view the enemy are my role as I am the

50
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,670
director IT security for a large large

51
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,950
aerospace and defense company and dove
Mike day jobs writing policies

52
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,750
standards are creating up processes and
stuff that are designed to ensure that

53
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,910
our network so

54
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,470
don't get penetrated and a lot of that
is also doing things such as a

55
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,530
making sure that people are actively
trying to penetrate on

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,530
that tell me what the result so that is

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,940
okay so so what's this all about well
using the web for using a

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,040
your browser to penetration test this
the way it used to be

59
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,880
is you know you going to Google and you
know you use Google

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,900
or use that your browser has primarily
in information gathering tool and

61
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,350
there's a lot of stuff out there and
we'll talk about that

62
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,090
on thats then now

63
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,940
we've got specialized web sites their
specific

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,579
you know for specific types of research
you know then was

65
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,640
individual programs for separate types
of tests now

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,659
you can use Firefox is a platform

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,650
to launch attacks van wise

68
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:33,359
different interfaces whether it was a
proprietary program

69
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,290
or a specific interface every program
you have some sort a different interface

70
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:40,090
you have to learn whether its command
minor there's a

71
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,880
whether the security now you can use the
browser

72
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,909
to launch attacks from there and then
was generally

73
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,270
OS specific tools if you want to use

74
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,060
a specific tool it's gonna be have to be
on a specific platform and

75
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,490
a lot of those tools branch out
important to Windows or Linux or

76
00:04:59,490 --> 00:04:59,930
whatever

77
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,040
now mostly you can do you

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,870
I some penetration testing transparent
to the operating system so it doesn't

79
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,490
really matter

80
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,490
I am now we're not suggesting that

81
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:16,610
all hacking should be done through
Firefox

82
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,190
we're not suggesting that it should be
done that way or that it's desirable

83
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,710
beaded

84
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,780
to be done that way what we're
suggesting is that the

85
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,360
the via the power Firefox inner

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,570
you know essentially be able to put
extensions on Firefox to add

87
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,590
it to its active abilities really

88
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,440
goes beyond the information-gathering
stage if your pen test

89
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,240
and that you really now have a very
powerful platform

90
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,640
for penetration testing so not just
gathering information and then going off

91
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,180
to use your tools but actually

92
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,479
sitting there with the browser and being
able to really

93
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,180
do a good deep you know a decent
penetration test using just the browser

94
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,180
with your add-ons

95
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:13,780
step

96
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,160
this

97
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,360
are so what are we gonna talk about
today so the things we're going to start

98
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,110
off with his

99
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,490
but racin testing methodology it will
cover

100
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,580
just really a high-level energy issue
let you know that there are

101
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,120
methodologies out there

102
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,700
that are designed to help you follow a
standardized process and doing

103
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,200
contesting makes it a lot easier to do
it then we're going to talk

104
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,200
some specific things that you can do
want been testing the web with Firefox

105
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,460
will get into how to use Firefox
stand-alone

106
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,340
we get into how to do it with some more
up

107
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,460
the website based tools that you again
get certain web sites that we have found

108
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,660
to be useful when conducting Pinto's

109
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,140
and then there's plugins and extensions
I mean anybody uses Firefox on a regular

110
00:06:59,140 --> 00:06:59,760
basis

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,380
probably has twenty or thirty of these
extensions in there that I used quite

112
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,100
frequently

113
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,540
sum up we found 0 quite useful

114
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,180
summer you know used a today some I'm
you only use when you're doing specific

115
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,640
task and we'll talk about doing some
setups and stuff

116
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,099
will also talk about using Firefox is a
funny and to do a lot of things

117
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,280
and then No then we'll give you some
ideas to places like

118
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,540
those %uh view that were in here for a
while toms talk previously he talked

119
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,110
about the live CDs and

120
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,270
in being able to do this in a safe
environment are

121
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:37,270
we're going to show you some web sites
that are designed toms is one on their

122
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,130
other some other distributions

123
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,620
and stuff for you can go out new can
practice the skills and hone the skills

124
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,310
without running afoul of because we all
know we don't wanna

125
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,390
end up spending any time behind bars so

126
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,050
we're gonna coming up you do this kinda
safely so that when you do

127
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,360
get permission from a customer to
actually do it

128
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,560
you hold your skills you know what to do
and in your very successful at it

129
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,140
methodologies that we have some moments
years

130
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,460
like the open source security testing
methodology manual

131
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,160
OS STM are this is a freely available
manual

132
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,460
there is a version to version 3 will be
coming out

133
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,800
if your subscriber you can have access
to Virgin three now

134
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,190
if you're not you have to wait until is
publicly released but

135
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,040
it is out there it is very good its high
level gives you water the processes

136
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,349
and the steps in it lays it out in a in
a manner so that if you follow all

137
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,360
then the chances of success in been
testing or

138
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,530
proving to the customer that their side
is

139
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,800
basically secure from everything that
you're able to do

140
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:52,170
up is increased we opened our web
application security product project was

141
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:52,640
a

142
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,240
another one the we found very useful and
its since its open source it's available

143
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,990
to all love you

144
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,760
are milstar I do as does Michael %ah to
work with the federal government federal

145
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,819
government agencies

146
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,600
and there's a lot of information
available for from the federal

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,100
government

148
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,410
on doing contest in securing systems and
stuff and I encourage you all to look at

149
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:13,980
those

150
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,180
and then the penetration testing
framework is a

151
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,870
another type a framework design to

152
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,680
help you give you some hits and tell you
a standard process to go through

153
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,150
and when you go through standard
processes you have a better chance

154
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:34,040
love being able to successfully do what
it is because you're doing the same

155
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,930
thing you're using the same approach
it's not gonna give you every step you

156
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,770
should do

157
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,020
its gonna tell you some things to a tale

158
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:45,270
some things to look for in then you have
to use your experience and your

159
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,970
knowledge

160
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,780
as a pen tester to take those and
determine what it is you really need to

161
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,360
focus

162
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,820
what's over the steps or none of these
methodologies and under these

163
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,089
frameworks are going to be a silver
bullet there is no silver bullet the

164
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:00,620
silver bullet is up here

165
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,610
its years experience and it's being able
to interpret correctly

166
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,680
the results you get from your tools and
stuff so no matter which is the

167
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,320
methodologies you choose

168
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,620
its typically a process that you go
through when we found the process to be

169
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,290
things like

170
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,439
planning a reconnaissance thats
predetermine

171
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,440
go back Mon next slide

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,770
of

173
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,949
OWA up

174
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,020
amazing looks like pic

175
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:46,689
so planning and reconnaissance this is
work

176
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,050
you know you've got your target you've
been con- tracted by some

177
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,960
company or your own company to go out
and protest their

178
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,900
external or internal and you start the
planning of this this is where you sit

179
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,960
down and you look at the

180
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,120
it's the initial state what is it you're
trying to do

181
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,430
what are you trying to accomplish you
put all those the rules in place terms

182
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,640
of engagement with the customer excedrin
and then

183
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,000
you call start collecting information
about your target network

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,510
next one is the scanning enumeration
this is where you actually start doing

185
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,840
things that are active

186
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,860
this is where you go out you start doing
the data collection

187
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,110
you ski and what ports are open Tom
showed you earlier life CD

188
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,100
and relieve there's a couple was in the
audience I'm not sure how many are we

189
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,640
did it actually did

190
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,500
India maps can on there and found about
twenty seven different services that

191
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,480
were wide open

192
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,860
on that so access point and that website
is

193
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,940
and server that he had stood up running
on his laptop

194
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,000
when you get into gaining access and
penetration

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,090
we're not going to get into that here we
are going to give use

196
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,320
a little bit book we're not really gonna
give you 20 days or stuff like that but

197
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,960
there are things that you can do with
Firefox to

198
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,540
enable you to look and have a better
idea in a better chance of successfully

199
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,469
gaining access

200
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:06,050
if in fact the services are exploitable
and then maintaining access an

201
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,890
exploration

202
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,610
this is all part of the frameworks and
methodologies but not something we're

203
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,800
going to address here

204
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,860
and then finally covering your tracks

205
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,020
I'll not good sites that of hopefully

206
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,110
when you're doing this you're doing this
legally and

207
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,760
you have permission in you don't want to
do any harm

208
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,110
that's the number one rule I have 1i
have to do these days I'll do no harm I

209
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,140
go as far as I can to prove that I could

210
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,069
but I'm not gonna change or knock down
in the services intentionally

211
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:42,070
let us

212
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,730
up going to some other specifics about
to

213
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,760
different ways %uh views in the browser

214
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,130
our first stand-alone so we're talking
about %uh

215
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,970
just using your browser's you no doubt
you could download Firefox

216
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:00,720
no extensions and and things you could
do there and the second one is website

217
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,510
based also thats things that you places
you can go

218
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:06,700
web sites that are already out there to
do these things so again

219
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,870
and and really both these you could use
any browser for you could use Internet

220
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,950
Explorer I don't know why you'd want to
but you could

221
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,560
%ah

222
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,780
Google hacks johnnie long stalk for
several years

223
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,410
about the Google hacks and there they're
all out there so I mean

224
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,040
would be wrist remiss if you not to use
that in your test um

225
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,560
was will give you example three good
examples

226
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,410
or what we found to be good examples of
extensions or plug-ins that Firefox has

227
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,199
out there

228
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,990
um Firefox is a front end for other
tools like Metasploit

229
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,550
and such like that and then you know
we're gonna say hey here sixty good

230
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,620
extensions you're probably not gonna
wanna put up 60 extensions in your

231
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,340
browser cuz gonna be a memory hog

232
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,800
possible give you some ideas on how you
can how you can deal with that

233
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,290
so

234
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,920
stand alone at the Bakshi download
Firefox 3.0

235
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,100
point one now out on the web of the
website um

236
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,250
outta the box your your your

237
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,440
largely limited to you know
information-gathering

238
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,030
and this this make sense because like I
said you could use any browser to do

239
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,560
this

240
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,140
%ah but there's a lot of stuff out there
and

241
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,760
in penetration testing the general a
general rule is the more information you

242
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,710
can gather

243
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:27,120
about your target the better your
chances are exploiting that target and

244
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,190
how you gonna find that bonneville
service if you if you're not doing

245
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,510
if you're not looking out there so WHOIS
search is out there Sam speed

246
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,819
DNS stuff %uh Netcraft toolbar we'll
talk a little bit about that

247
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,180
up Edgar filings love people mall

248
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,360
forget to look in that stuff I am and
then

249
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,680
in the using Google you know newsgroups
how many that

250
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,530
how many network administrators have a
problem with XYZ box and they go on to a

251
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,490
news group an ass for people to help
with a got a problem

252
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,060
with I got a problem with this device
and i cant fix it well

253
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:05,330
if he's the network administrator for
you know whatever corporation now you

254
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,340
know what devices are using and you
haven't even done anything

255
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,480
and you know and you may even know what
vulnerabilities ES

256
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,690
I mean cell you know and that this is
all pass if you have any touched any any

257
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:20,460
you know stuff that you're talking about

258
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,130
so website based tools again not
necessarily something you have to use

259
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,720
Firefox 4 but

260
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,610
website based tools and maps you don't
have an app on your computer fine just

261
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,800
go to this website and map online that
you can use

262
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,140
the checkers and host to have crackers
and I'll talk about few these

263
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,480
a directly so here's

264
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,630
here's a site tonight %ah one example a
site that you may

265
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,650
use central ops not met this as a whole
buncha tools in

266
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,990
I won't go into all the specifics but
you can do trace route Spain's

267
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,400
you know all the tools you could you
from a command line you can do from a

268
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,660
site like this the service is pretty
cool

269
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,510
arm and and these are all freeze things
you can do so

270
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:08,500
if you you may be may be here you know a
cracka ma'am I cripple like I am and

271
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,810
in the you needed you I sometimes too to
get through the door

272
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:16,650
well here you go this is a great way to
do it

273
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:20,550
here you go and map online so you don't
you're you get your pen testing site

274
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,410
and for whatever reason you got you need
and mapping you don't have well here you

275
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:24,699
go

276
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,130
an app online go to this website type in
your target

277
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,189
boom now granted

278
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,950
you have a proper a few problems here
well first of all that's not my IP

279
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:39,510
because I am using tor but

280
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,930
you can customize this can you know if
you know the command line things you

281
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,320
want to do here

282
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,840
in the custom skin your setup whatever
you want to do and scan it you're going

283
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,650
to get results

284
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,410
right there so quick and easy way to use
a an online tool

285
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,839
if you don't have something you need

286
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,840
what's that Terms of Service go or even
before %um India

287
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,230
right and and like we stand john
mentioned to me

288
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:13,829
and what we may talk about this a little
later you be on depending upon

289
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,449
you know you're trying to disguise we're
coming from tor might be a good idea to

290
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,150
use

291
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,180
once you're doing active tests because

292
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,490
you know if if they know where you're
coming from now you kinda given yourself

293
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,940
away so

294
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,940
towards not a perfect solution but in
this case it provides you with what you

295
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:36,940
want your disguising your own identity

296
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,659
this this is a good example the tool
that you might use

297
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,440
if you doing say a a vulnerability
assessment your RT on the inside

298
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,720
and you're doing vulnerability
assessment so this is kind of a this

299
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,000
hacker whacker GRC her tips research
also has a

300
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,930
beleaguered Lee checker this is gonna
look kinda from the inside and saying

301
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:59,840
hey you're vulnerable to this and this
and that course or thanks L

302
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,409
something that's messed not so we can
work from a up you know a

303
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,520
a black box that penetration test but if
you're on the inside doing a

304
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,980
vulnerability assessment

305
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,040
something that you might want to
consider

306
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,129
these are all examples of web sites that

307
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,980
have arm online hash crackers

308
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,370
so YouTube you've grabbed a I am

309
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,200
whatever md5 for: you know your land man
hash of a website

310
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,420
you don't have your tables with you and
you wanna cracker

311
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,610
post them on the website you know it may
take a day or two but

312
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,870
I you may get the results back

313
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,010
and a caveat here now

314
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:47,080
if you do if you're doing a penetration
test you may you probably a sign some

315
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,720
sort of non-disclosure agreement with
your client

316
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,280
but you're not gonna reveal their data
well if you post

317
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,920
their lawn man hashes or whatever on on
this website it's pretty much publicly

318
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,870
available now

319
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,160
now that doesn't say this hash is
associated with this particular company

320
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,420
but you're still exposing their data

321
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,580
to the web SABIC a review will be
careful about using the sorta services

322
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,790
here's a good example for from the earth
like steady at home and all those

323
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,040
distributed computing projects

324
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,260
this is a rainbow table distributing pre
are distributing project so you sign up

325
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,410
use your CPU cycles when you're not
using your computer

326
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,880
and you're basically helping them
generate you know large-scale

327
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,290
take rainbow tables for land manner ante
el amor what you know whatever you want

328
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,870
to do and the

329
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,190
md5 and such so if this is an aunt again
they also have a

330
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,540
a submission to hear you can send an
accident a hash

331
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,670
and get information backs this is kinda
cool stuff to use

332
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,030
stuff it's out there you know I'm at the
site

333
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,200
and i forgot my drive that has my tables
on line you know this may help you

334
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,830
in that case

335
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,550
I this is that johnnie launched Google
hacking database has been updated in a

336
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,290
few years however

337
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:03,649
good examples you know you know you
don't necessarily need

338
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,920
this website to show you everything that
this will give you a good start

339
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,340
I love you know the whole concept is
Google hacking is finding information

340
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,909
that's not supposed to be on the web but
no

341
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,420
you know Google's spiders have crawled
to it because I've

342
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,680
inadequate permissions or whatever so I
mean

343
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,720
I can't understate the power these
things mean they're people they just put

344
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,500
their

345
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,060
you know default installs on the think
there's password lists there's

346
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,560
you know what my friends likes to search
for governments for past

347
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,200
I mean he's found all kinds of stuff
that's available out there

348
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,020
on so in this is of course you know this
is just using was publicly available are

349
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,840
you out there

350
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:48,399
information that's not necessarily
supposed to be on the web yes

351
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,620
yeah we can't walk we can post it on my
for

352
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,570
um and then don't %ah don't discount
also when I i this year

353
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,040
don't discount the using like Google
cache more like I

354
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,090
arc I Barack in an archives

355
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,540
so in for some company has some
sensitive data exposed on their website

356
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,240
they take it down and they think they're
safe but Google cached

357
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,000
will cash that maybe or archives you
know are already online see may find

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,320
some stuff out there

359
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,040
away

360
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,870
using Firefox plugins and extensions
we've listed a couple here that we're

361
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,880
going to talk about the first one is 0

362
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,890
what's called the Firefox catalog
auditing extensions or fire Kia

363
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:43,390
this is currently in a release for and
it's available what this gives you is

364
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,299
about 60 extensions

365
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,440
it is continuously growing so and it's
got him out

366
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,440
in a nice so those %uh view that are
familiar with my email format that lease

367
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,160
amount you know

368
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,090
our show your screen here just a second
what it looks like it talk to you just a

369
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,010
little bit about it

370
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,210
and then we're going to talk about a
couple of examples that we're gonna walk

371
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,760
for

372
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,879
are not necessarily in the order shown
here but the

373
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,790
a passive week on exploit leave which is
a group love

374
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,659
or exploit tools and then our a tool
called tamper data

375
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:18,500
we find very useful this here's a

376
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,559
kinda night s this is the mind map for
Firecat and

377
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,809
just to show you a couple things that
are there up if you're using proxies or

378
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:30,639
Web utilities here's a grouping of those
and it shows you the plugins that you

379
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,200
can get

380
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,929
don't have to do all up in you can do
water to whatever you're familiar with

381
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,400
up then it talks about
information-gathering these the ones

382
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,100
that the

383
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,790
been pretty much a primary focus on work
this talk is about

384
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,970
and as you can see their number some
areas under their

385
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:51,350
up tools like a location information
doing in new rating fingerprinting

386
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:55,150
data mining up Google inspiring

387
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,919
next is arduous security auditing these
things so

388
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,840
like proxies on the web filters and
stuff

389
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,780
these are up calumny tools and there's

390
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,178
there's a lot of what you see in the
guys constantly updating the side

391
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,380
updating the list is new plugins and
stuff for made available

392
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,660
and then though occasionally you do need
to do some editing so if you needed it

393
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,110
with Firefox or something

394
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,669
here so some Firefox extensions and
plugins for doing that

395
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:27,650
in the network utilities these are
always quite

396
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,530
useful doing FTP on intrusion detection
sniffers database wifi

397
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,950
are and then there's also some
miscellaneous ones as well as a

398
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,510
some others but the site do a search for
the term Firecat

399
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:46,400
on Google and it will take you right
there are you may

400
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,510
get directed to await the show's version
1.2

401
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,679
if you do go back to Google look at
another 1i think it's the second link

402
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:54,890
that shows up now

403
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,260
his version 1.4 which is the latest
release

404
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:05,260
wanna talk like we said we got three
examples above

405
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,150
and this is certainly not exhaustive
less than this the best stuff out there

406
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,730
this is just three things we pick their
comps

407
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,620
we think you're kinda cool the first one
is actually series of three extensions

408
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,080
called exploit me

409
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,600
there's three extensions a this was
introduced that sect or in Toronto last

410
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,360
year

411
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,909
by the Kaiser security compass %uh they
actually had a talk at sect or

412
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:30,980
specifically for these tools so if you
what's more details on giving you here

413
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,390
download their talk from the sect or
website %uh and

414
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,620
you get a whole bunch of information the
first one is %uh

415
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,929
axis X SS me which is a cross-site
scripting toward searches for

416
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:49,190
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities I
if you're a big fan oven looking for a

417
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,450
cross-site scripting vulnerabilities as
a website xx

418
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:58,770
X as fast speedy dot com it's basically
a repository of XSS vulnerabilities

419
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,000
in fact you can even sort them by page
ranks of the sort them the number 11

420
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,590
it's going to come up as young as about

421
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,129
50 XSS vulnerabilities on differently on
pages

422
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:13,110
self pretty interesting site in terms
about what stuff that's already out

423
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,590
there

424
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,899
the second one is %uh

425
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,830
SQL inject me I'll show you a picture
this on the next slide

426
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,990
I and this is just again just testing
SQL injection

427
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,110
vulnerabilities and then the third one
is access me

428
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,049
and this is basically when you serve to
a website that requires you to enter

429
00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:33,330
some sort of

430
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:37,490
permissions to get to you access me will
try to access the site without those

431
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:41,110
permissions to see if it if their
permission vulnerabilities their

432
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,190
are there's a couple tools that they're
talking about releasing the future

433
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,860
webservice me overflow me and numerate
me and brute force me so these may come

434
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,760
out in the near future

435
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,658
we're still working on

436
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:57,149
here's an example love of XSS me

437
00:25:57,149 --> 00:26:01,220
I it simply it's a sidebar you click on
it and as a side bar to comes up

438
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,740
and if you've got forms fourth of you
got forms in your web page

439
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,360
on they're going to be listed on the
side bar for example

440
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,600
%uh the 2600 page has a form on the
sidebar

441
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,890
so it's displayed on the sidebar and you
literally just have to enter information

442
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,770
any any valid information in the fields
and then you can test there's also

443
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:23,860
there's a whole library of of tests
where you can just

444
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,390
run-through you know of a series of
tests and

445
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,480
and that and that it will be a report to
tell you this

446
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,600
this particular field perform was
vulnerable to this particular exploits

447
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,190
that's kinda cool

448
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:39,419
um now again

449
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,159
you click on that button to test you
realize what you're doing you know

450
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,260
you're accessing somebody's website that
way it was intended your

451
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,340
you may be breaking the law so I didn't
click on this button

452
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:55,080
by it's there

453
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:58,379
SQL inject me is the same sort of thing
you've got

454
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,309
aside by the comes out any forms that
are

455
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,240
I visible on the page will show up in
the tabs and you can simply

456
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,350
you know test you can test like the top
the most common vulnerabilities are you

457
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:10,800
can test

458
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,559
all the ones in the library so literally
just click on you get a report

459
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,889
a and I mean so

460
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,000
is point click the best way to go maybe
or maybe not but

461
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,149
if you wanna sit there in manually typed

462
00:27:24,149 --> 00:27:27,620
a you know

463
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,860
whatever SQL strings are trying to test
you know

464
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,470
incentive doing one at a time okay this
one works this one doesn't work this is

465
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,700
gonna do it all for you

466
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,770
this doesn't replace your you know the
importance for you to learn this stuff

467
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,010
yourself but this this helps you
automated a little bit

468
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,840
also a disclaimer that this isn't
necessarily gonna find every single

469
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,780
vulnerability there may be something out
there that the thousand fine

470
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,340
but it's you know it's a good start this
is this is kinda like your

471
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,620
the Nessus can you know it's gonna find
a lot of stuff that's not confined

472
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,330
everything

473
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:02,210
and doesn't absolve you from digging
deeper

474
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,280
the second 1i want to talk about Scott
tamper data

475
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,990
tamper data it a acts like a bus from
any proxy server in your browser

476
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,740
and allows you to view and modify I am

477
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,960
HTTPS headers as their send and return
to your computer

478
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,480
I you can also trace time times in
responses and stuff like that

479
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,200
this is popular unfortunately this has
become popular for

480
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,110
for hacking at e-commerce sites that
don't do server-side validation

481
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,640
in other words and I'll show you an
example here

482
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,210
and then if you search sadly if you
search on

483
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,840
YouTube you'll find that the probably
the most popular use for this is like

484
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,549
changing the high score on like
flash-based games

485
00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,129
so you have the high score I mean it's
kinda silly but

486
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:53,299
um fun buff it could be fun

487
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,100
and i cant see my screen here but I'm
gonna try to give you just a small

488
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:56,830
example

489
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,139
also caveat this is the example in
giving her is is already in own website

490
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,190
that's vulnerable

491
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,250
I'm not this is not the first time
somebody's done this

492
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,899
and I'm not gonna go through with it
completely but just to give me an

493
00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:14,899
example

494
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,710
okay

495
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,140
okay device called our you know it the
TV be gone is it

496
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,140
its search goes through all the coat was
another device called the ninja remote

497
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:28,800
and it gives you more

498
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,520
actually he's a little bit more
capability you can actually change

499
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,930
channels and change the volume and stuff
like that

500
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:40,930
well this this the button this device
you can buy them on this page

501
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:53,019
so the links here are basically the more
you buy the cheaper they are self

502
00:29:53,019 --> 00:30:00,019
the first one is five min a remote for
$49.95 plus shipping

503
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:25,130
so what do I want to pay

504
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:43,450
that's not an editable feel that's
what's return and again this is because

505
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,559
the their server

506
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,460
is not validating the price when it
comes back to

507
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,619
again now I can't guarantee that if you
go ahead by this that you'll get it at

508
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:55,109
that price because they may find it
later on

509
00:30:55,109 --> 00:30:58,129
life the point is the website is
vulnerable to that

510
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:01,539
and again but like I said this is
already been demonstrating not

511
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:04,820
this is not my taking credit for finding
this website in the vulnerability

512
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:11,820
but pretty powerful stuff

513
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,290
for

514
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,909
it's always

515
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,980
right

516
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:40,249
thanks

517
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:43,870
were doing

518
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,130
it

519
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,690
amiss a mission to tulua call passes
rekon and

520
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,950
show you a little bit about it here
essentially what it will do

521
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,970
is it automates a lot of things there's
a lotta love

522
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,210
areas that it gives you a DNS queries

523
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,640
in the world actually do trace rails for
your water

524
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,580
it'll use some %uh the Google scripts
that we talked about the search for text

525
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,949
files PPT

526
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,090
PDF Excel spreadsheets and cetera

527
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:16,330
and it's got it all nicely laid down
everything

528
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,949
so we're going to do a little demo here
but to give you

529
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,460
the heads up up in this is a site

530
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,680
on we chose somebody random this happens
to be the

531
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,040
are I a and the so

532
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,960
go down the bottom and then all the way
down the bottom where it says scan all

533
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:39,340
what's next one there you go its Kindle

534
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,870
notices this thing is going to open 22

535
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:47,510
tabs across the top of the page here so
each one of those commands that you saw

536
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,810
a second ago

537
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,810
arm are all being in the room a rated
their

538
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:55,030
if you want to go and there's
DomainTools gives you information about

539
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,110
the domain

540
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,340
who is registered to how long it's been
there up

541
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:04,210
this is who is gives you the registrar
information associated with the IP

542
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,890
address

543
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,720
looks like the network timeout that must
be the

544
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,080
love email servers domain Exchange
servers you wanna know what their email

545
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,700
addresses are there's a DNS to land here
the UBA records ns records

546
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,050
MX records so you can kinda look at
things like

547
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,870
they may be having someone host their
web sites for all but you look at the a

548
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,760
records different IP address

549
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,970
may give you an idea that you may not
wanted attacked the website and may want

550
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,400
to look at their host sites that are
registered them

551
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,120
and not to some service provider are
Netcraft

552
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,300
want this is a great tool when you use
Netcraft

553
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,370
up there's a lot of information that use
your like to say what you click on that

554
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,420
one button

555
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,330
and tell it to run all those test it
will open twenty two different tabs

556
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,220
you know tell you up go to the one for
the good one

557
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,530
about some documents and stuff

558
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:06,530
probably gotta go farther to the right
mood

559
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,450
text this I'll also this Google searches
for

560
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:15,678
documents PDF PDF files

561
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,880
Excel files on the website there so you
might find something

562
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,550
in to give you links to tell you what
sites are linked on the site with sites

563
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,480
linked to it

564
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,740
are quite a few on there so

565
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,060
you know it's it's a fun thing to play
around with even even if you're not

566
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,799
doing a pen testing you just wanna know
a lot about

567
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,850
some organizations you know dot gov

568
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,250
dot Miller sup it's interesting to see
what information is really available

569
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,560
off from them on the world okay

570
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,230
and in let's say if you look down there
there's the list over man the one always

571
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,750
on the bottom there were sis

572
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,739
scan all so you know if you want to do
if you're looking for something specific

573
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,910
you can click on the individual ones

574
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:03,009
are few justina you know you information
overload jockey like I am

575
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:06,210
you click on scan all in and sit there
and go through that for about half an

576
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:06,980
hour or so

577
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,820
are here's a close look up %uh

578
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,360
2600 Autoworks and this is what's
registered owner for them for the DNS

579
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,980
interesting to note though to differ

580
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:27,170
IP address range is there the slide is a

581
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:33,780
here's their DNS information

582
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,550
wanna know what their mail servers and
MX records were there at

583
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,650
again noticed in a servers in two
different places so that means if one

584
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,010
goes down they got the other

585
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:51,010
and then though we'll look at some files
here's the link these are sites that the

586
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,290
2600 .org links to so you can kinda

587
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:59,369
till what their affiliated with who they
may be doing business with

588
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:04,040
and some other information like that
going through their and then

589
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,759
wanna know how long they've had the the
address

590
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,109
and one thing I haven't been able to
figure out if you look down around 2000

591
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:12,520
Renault

592
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,700
Department of Treasury or justice is it
own

593
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:21,140
2600 or not sure how that got there but
it's a result I got when I went to the

594
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,810
site so

595
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:25,740
you pick up some interesting stuff it
just gives you a lot of information

596
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,470
that's very very useful

597
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,830
because as sung soo said novae enemy so
if you're gonna paint us to get

598
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,250
something best thing you can do is get
very very knowledgeable

599
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,470
about the company the business or
whatever the

600
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,670
your target is that you've been hired to
legally do a pen test up

601
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:49,670
are so that you can better do it me go
back this like don't underestimate the

602
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,770
power of information here's a good
example

603
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,730
not miss specifically on a slight
Netcraft I'll

604
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,150
what's this site running okay so you see
that's

605
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,290
your target is running I S whatever and

606
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:10,950
NetCast Netcraft also has uptime reports

607
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:15,109
well what if I I with Microsoft for the
stakes

608
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:19,109
a patch to a critical I asked Boehner
bility on Tuesday

609
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:22,348
and the web your target which required a
reboot

610
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:27,849
and your target hasn't been rebooted in
a month how powerful is that to you that

611
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,470
vulnerability is now yours

612
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,520
I mean pretty powerful information out
there so

613
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,910
don't discount the power of passive
information

614
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:42,910
or room

615
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:49,130
he's a couple other add-ons that we
think are nice people have time to talk

616
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,090
about and add and edit cookies

617
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,500
it's pretty self-explanatory bites title
um

618
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,170
Firebug is a really cool tool for
editing things on the fly

619
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,350
editing that CSS reading the HTML or the
other

620
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,610
the JavaScript um

621
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,140
pack far does a lot of cool things you
can now

622
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,540
ops UK that's according to cops UK you
can

623
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,590
say you say you have an SQL injection
but you

624
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,550
think you might be able to bypass the
IDS biopsy cating the

625
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,580
the URL that you're typing in this'll do
it for you

626
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:27,230
because that and web developers a really
cool tool not just for Penn testers but

627
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,850
for web developers in general

628
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:33,270
so

629
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,850
now we're moving on to using Firefox as
a

630
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:41,400
a fun and so using Firefox as kind of
the the interface for some other tool

631
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,560
well we already talked about or on the
first to

632
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,900
why the first extensions out there for
to restore button Henley

633
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,290
ever pretty much everyone's here for
one's pretty cool I mean click on it and

634
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,830
it automatically changes your

635
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,620
your proxy settings for for TOR what if
you like to use other tools Paris

636
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,180
proxies one of my favorite tools

637
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,819
I am and there's other ones Burke
proxies by proxy

638
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,790
well I am you can use %uh I extension
cords which proxy which allow you to do

639
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,770
multiple extension secret but war

640
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,160
I Paros spike whatever so literally
click the next

641
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,299
click the Buy click the button thing
you're being you know you're done

642
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:21,680
on you can also use Firefox is a fun and
for other tools

643
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,240
a Metis late lot of people you know if
you're mad if you know mess but you

644
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,660
probably command my guy but

645
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,609
you know you could do it via the command
RVL web find

646
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,120
there's a a tool that specific to
backtrack called

647
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,359
I fast-track fresher truly court or to
show you example what that looks like

648
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:42,780
on in protect has a up

649
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,150
I an extension that the web interface
for necessary and map

650
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,930
now those tools have to be installed on
your system but that's kinda cool to do

651
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,149
to be able to a from browser

652
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,460
and then if you're using snort you know
and bass you can you

653
00:39:54,460 --> 00:40:00,960
yet your fun and for for Firefox

654
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,760
Metasploit front and this is the the
ever-popular RPC decom exploit the easy

655
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,520
and psycho

656
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,830
I S five unpatched and works

657
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:16,830
really easy this is fast track it
started out as a command line tool you

658
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,779
can see the cool things there does a

659
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,910
you can you like a mess play are upon
which is bangs a whole bunch exploits

660
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,240
against book services that it finds to
see if it's vulnerable

661
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,540
um its its yet known as

662
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,990
on if you have like a XP Service Pack
two or three box

663
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,640
this isn't gonna work against it but I
mean it's if you have something older

664
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,600
it's been a fun

665
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,770
if you run this for example if you run
this against like a buy Windows Server

666
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,160
2003 service pack 4 but no

667
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,020
from further updates after that it'll
give you like five different shells

668
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,860
so I mean it's pretty cool SQL injection
all sorts of things

669
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,410
and

670
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:00,649
ok a couple recommendations we got about
10 to 15 minutes left here we'll try to

671
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,320
get done so we have time for questions
so

672
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,470
here's our concern you just download
Firecat you've got sixty extensions in

673
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:08,150
now Firefox takes for ever

674
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:11,240
open I'll give an example um

675
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,320
I loaded a clean profile so Firefox with
nothing on it

676
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,740
and then one with 20 extensions and use
twice as much memories

677
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,730
I mean that's a valid concern you may
have a a lightweight system that you

678
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:21,550
can't do that with

679
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,550
and if you down if your gonna install
all sixty those there's gonna be a lot

680
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,240
of duplicates there's like three tools
to switch proxies in

681
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,770
you know so you don't necessarily want
all of them so it's a

682
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,960
it's a legitimate memories concern time
to load the fix for you

683
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,130
I recommend is using Firefox profile
manager so instead of

684
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,220
fire if so using windows Firefox that
EXE

685
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,110
Firefox that he exceed aSTRO File
Manager what that does is opened up a

686
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,820
little box where you can create your own

687
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:53,850
separate profiles so you could have an
everyday profile that use the web for

688
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,690
and then you could have

689
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:59,470
a a profile that uses are for contesting
that you have more extensions on cell

690
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,120
and then just install those that you
only use

691
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,839
on a regular basis you know I have about
20 on my much as

692
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,280
the lot for some people but I those are
the ones I use if you can I can use it

693
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,270
if you if you find you're not using them
just take them out

694
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:20,640
a couple other concerns %uh portability
so you're always going from the office

695
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,720
to the client site to another client and
for whatever reason you may not have

696
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,050
your laptop

697
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:29,300
and you you don't wanna sit there and
have to install

698
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,280
I individual extensions every time he
goes there's a there's a series of three

699
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,090
extensions out there

700
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,170
that will help you would do this on so
you don't sit there and install at on

701
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:39,590
dat

702
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:43,600
20 add-ons every time you wanna do this
for some coffee tea or Firefox

703
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,760
environment backup

704
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,010
extensions basically just backs up your
extensions

705
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:53,190
on clio were actually take all your XP I
far XP I as a step

706
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,630
compressed extension I will take all
your XP I files

707
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,730
and put them into one XP I so you could
have 20% interest installing a lost soul

708
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,180
all wants its kinda cool and then you
can also

709
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,149
us Eva next important for your
preferences so all these tools

710
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,780
are pretty cool in terms of managing
your extensions

711
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:16,590
extensions to manager extensions

712
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:20,660
so we started this presentation months
ago in Firefox too was

713
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,160
was was the thing in Firefox 3 did not
come out yet

714
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,270
and I'm thinking ok and is gonna stick
with Firefox to

715
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,350
Firefox trees and come out can be a big
version and

716
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,560
you know that most extensions are
maintained by like one guy

717
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,890
in a few dozen the time to update for
compatibility my stuff like at work and

718
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,109
presentation of all parts gonna be hard

719
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:43,980
so and an awesome functionality for
extension that use all the time is is

720
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,130
that's a legitimate concern because
there's

721
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,940
some extensions watch slow updates to
Firefox 3 compatibility

722
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:54,610
for example the SQL inject mean access
me are those

723
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:58,500
haven't been updated yet to you Firefox
3 but I'm running Firefox 3 in the up

724
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,820
there socially hide

725
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:05,460
the your fixes are you know there's %uh
sometimes people

726
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,260
not someone other than developer will
download the code and fix it

727
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,950
and reacted with a slightly different
name the one of the tools I mention

728
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,090
before switch proxy

729
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:17,850
which I my favorite tools well there's
no one called multi switch proximity to

730
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:21,120
the same form of a process which which
is the same thing interested

731
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,330
someone else fixed it the second fixes
to you

732
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,460
um manually edit the extension yourself

733
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,430
and this requires a couple things first
of all you actually need to sign up

734
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,069
on the add-on but Firefox add-ons
website create your own account

735
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:40,600
this allow you to do a couple things if
you try to download an extension for

736
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,550
for fire if you see a Firefox 3 you
trying to download extension that point

737
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,730
for your laptop

738
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:48,770
that isn't compatible its you're gonna
it's not too late

739
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:53,250
box can be grayed out if you sign in you
can click on ignore version check and

740
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,420
then let you download it

741
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,000
in any compatible version um

742
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,350
so you download the XP ifile like I said
the XBIZ actually just a compressed

743
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:06,400
it's just that the zip file die open up
the XP I

744
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,610
edit max version in the file install
that RTF

745
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,190
a baby Archive and Install it now give
an example also

746
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,640
keep in mind that not all extensions are
official and when you sign in you also

747
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,740
have access to what are called
experimental

748
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,250
extensions ones that are officially
approved by by meh Celia

749
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:25,650
so that may give you access to those now
keep in mind there may be reasons why

750
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:32,090
the experimental but

751
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,860
this is this is as simple as possible I
opened a

752
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,980
the up install are open the XP I have a
file

753
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,690
and our in in a program called seven Zip
which Israel it's freeware it's out

754
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,630
there it's easy to use

755
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:49,030
um I open installed on RDF in Notepad

756
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:52,450
and if you see that line it is max
version 2.0

757
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,350
change it to something greater than what
you're running so I just used a four

758
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,600
point

759
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:59,730
now this is not guaranteed to work for
everything because

760
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:03,930
again there's reasons why Firefox
Tuesday for Firefox 3 im a break

761
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:07,250
this week for example this is a download
manager tweak extension which actually

762
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,660
did not fix it but

763
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,000
so save this file update the archive
double click on again on the XP I file

764
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,280
install it

765
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,450
nine times out of ten it's going to work
for you it if I might add this morning I

766
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:22,300
was able to use this using WinZip

767
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,990
and work paired to update the XSS me
access me and exploit me

768
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:33,580
so if you're interested in those three
this technique does work for those three

769
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,450
so you wanna you got all this cool stuff
now and you wanna practice

770
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:40,030
the first thing on image if you're in
here for the previous talk we've already

771
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,130
mentioned a DI spent testing CDs

772
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:46,360
he's a really cool i John I've gone
through all the levels of this

773
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,800
and its trust me that second level is
tough

774
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,640
now we did we were doing eight hours a
day but it took us about a month to get

775
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,240
through it

776
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,230
I mean it's pretty tough soft don't
suspect it's going to be

777
00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:01,540
you know point click own it's not that
easy OWASP has see I spell it right on

778
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:03,230
this one

779
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,470
a lost cause a project now called web go
to and this is pretty cool it

780
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,530
its a lot easier you don't have to
download as many things that

781
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,400
just download stop Apache Tomcat a few
other things

782
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,060
and it it allows you to walk through
pretty good tool again it's mostly web

783
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:19,570
based stuff

784
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:23,020
I found stone has a series of Hackney
web sites

785
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,770
like at me Bank and Happy Tree a travel
agency

786
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:29,280
and see you can go through and their
they're intentionally have small

787
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,360
vulnerabilities and I'm so another thing
you can download

788
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,440
a tryout the pen testing CDs are you
mention

789
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,720
are some people like you VMware you know
set up a server with a bunch of VMware

790
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,540
image is running on it and use that as
your

791
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:46,259
as your targets and then there safe
hacking web sites out there I puts a

792
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:49,450
friend print this season I'm not gonna
mention any specific ones cuz I can't

793
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,050
guarantee that they're safe

794
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:54,950
but %ah you know or give there's one at
there's one call hacked this site at

795
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,300
Oregon

796
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,740
you know I'm like I said I'm not endorse
any specific sites guests I sites may

797
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,570
not be

798
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:05,260
safe but there are sites out there that
allow you to practice induce or so

799
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,980
things like down

800
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:10,510
and then again just a disclaimer don't
be stupid hack something you don't have

801
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,670
permission to

802
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,490
I mean yes you get that Russia like I
just did something illegal

803
00:48:16,490 --> 00:48:20,030
and nobody's gonna find out because if
you do something wrong

804
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,810
and p you know crashes a site or
something like that

805
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:27,450
you know that that you did something you
didn't end to do um

806
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,110
you know that's just you're just you
being down and and

807
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:34,530
you know it's been talked about the
before the myth of you know the more I

808
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:38,230
had to the more lead I am somebody will
hire me there's very few people who go

809
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:39,020
that route

810
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,340
you know there's a lot more people
sitting in jail or you know

811
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,810
that not everybody is is kevin Mitnick

812
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,480
and I don't mean that in a bad way and
he's one of the few that kinda went the

813
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,860
you know he started his own business so
it's not like somebody hired him

814
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,210
this is the stuff we talked about first
time out using Firefox a stand-alone

815
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:01,470
browser

816
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:05,440
suggest using the tools our website
based tools Google hacks

817
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,490
a bunch of extensions and plugins that
you

818
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,000
you may have known a few how many view
have

819
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,400
seen something today like an extension
or something

820
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,430
I was like wow I didn't know I could do
that and that's pretty cool how many

821
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,149
if they're very fine something use one
great great

822
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,920
using Firefox is a front and and we
didn't talk about

823
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,850
Faiza once you tell

824
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,290
I will also not mention anything
political

825
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,590
and then recommended set up places to
hack safely

826
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,330
there's a lot of up ideas out there for
other extensions and

827
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:45,690
and you can go to Firefox and you can
make your own Extensions exact they have

828
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:46,830
templates and

829
00:49:46,830 --> 00:49:49,950
if you want Firefox to do some I you
know

830
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:53,190
if you want Firefox to do something that
it doesn't do you know figure out if

831
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:59,830
you might feel the figure out yourself
or someone else are has already done it

832
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,569
I we've got about five minutes left and
we'll open it up for questions we ask

833
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,040
that if your gonna ask questions please
go to the microphone

834
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,440
so that stick its record in we can hear
you and everyone else can hear you

835
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,950
because if you if you yell at us
somebody else may not be able to talk to

836
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:20,950
you

837
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:29,560
I think it's off

838
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,799
maybe not I

839
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:42,990
just yelling out yeah I'm

840
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:48,080
let's see we're gonna post it can you
give me a parcel like yet and if I

841
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,000
posted I'll send it out for me

842
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,310
will try to give this a hope folks and
then city hopefully you can get it via

843
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:55,259
their website

844
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,490
on that's probably the easiest way um

845
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,820
otherwise you know just ask us for the
contact information we can post it

846

here that's that's what I found is very
very useful in stock
