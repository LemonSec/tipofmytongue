1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:07,130
high security handcuffs with great

2
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:11,828
of its tax

3
00:00:11,829 --> 00:00:14,529
you have a going to talk about

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,869
it's getting handcuffs

5
00:00:16,869 --> 00:00:21,070
uh... either first thing stock is a
shortage of deficit reduction

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,369
to mom and pops

7
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:27,029
i mean just south of the videos on
youtube how to open standard had cops

8
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:30,880
and so i don't uh... drawing to touch it
had too much because they're

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,170
but it's good to know the mechanism
because the guy security once

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,830
it's basically the same principle that
missing

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,980
so they go to the moment and props

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,640
shows inside

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,780
then move on to that launched models

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,700
and children weaknesses

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,730
because this loss has been reduced to
hop in our

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,410
we will do all of the picking stoppin
hands-on stuff afterwards

17
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,340
on the second level in the lock picking
area

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,070
so if you want to get your hands into or
onto feels the cops and try the picking

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,200
feel free to come with me after what's
down to the area

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,410
where you can do the hands-on stuff

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,750
uh... to spend a contrast today are
basically all of the same

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,760
at different brands of a little

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,360
but a different means more details

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,850
sis hasn't healed although it's been so

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,710
at the beginning of sit empty century

26
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,920
to have bean

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,310
tons of different models of handcuffs
this completely different mechanisms

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,260
because everybody invented something

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,090
even more difficult to pick

30
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,190
then what standard today

31
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,920
standard today's u_s_ is mainly five
brands to see them here

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,500
one of stunned bankrupt so it's for

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,870
about every police officer did at the
state says one of these

34
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,570
archie hazing copy of it

35
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:55,790
to cheat using copies basic here at the
same digest easier to peak

36
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,070
okay beauties

37
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,070
you see a few of them

38
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,680
it's pianist miss invest in hyd american
handcuffed

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,350
i've shown the a speedy

40
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,910
influ detailed

41
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,929
because was different and um... said

42
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,939
relatively new grant

43
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:14,549
is that you have key votes on both sides

44
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,369
which of course is to our advantage

45
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:21,680
it was intended to be but that's the
officers so they don't have to look

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,999
resonated with the key goes to benefit
handcuffing someone

47
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:28,840
but of course it's going to go to sleep
don't through the content of your today

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,919
so sick even if the wrong side

49
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:35,719
so that is a yellow one dollars as they
come in colors

50
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,129
but the other one cc i don't know if
it's

51
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,659
if it can be seen

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,759
but she only main difference is the
position of six year old

53
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:44,919
so some have secured in the middle

54
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:48,229
some have secured the site

55
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:52,650
but but that's mainly zzz a difference

56
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,489
these are not handcuffs

57
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,089
the sacrifice they won't talk about them
if you want to open them just tear apart

58
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,789
or stick a screwdriver in them or
whatever

59
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:10,579
but he won't air gets to the law
enforcement

60
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,409
i don't know how the how many of you
have already

61
00:03:13,409 --> 00:03:17,480
watch these utube videos are know how
this is working canoe had stopped for

62
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,540
those who have a clear already know
things that i had no meant tough

63
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:30,540
okay for the others remember those faces
for the next what's the fat contest

64
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,599
be at sickening strings true

65
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,629
boat which

66
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:36,759
goes around

67
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,239
it can move through

68
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,279
so today

69
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:42,480
and uh...

70
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,039
you see there is a black participated in
zaire that's basically the mechanism

71
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,189
you have said spring-loaded are

72
00:03:49,189 --> 00:03:51,790
which holds the tees off the boat

73
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,570
so

74
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,989
it goes

75
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:57,359
step-by-step but that can move freely as
long

76
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,929
as you don't look at

77
00:03:59,929 --> 00:04:01,469
the second thing runs a

78
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:04,698
the down side to him

79
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,649
it's a double lot bar

80
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:09,189
you have to move it

81
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:11,069
right and this picture

82
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:12,669
and dentist post

83
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,789
holds directions

84
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:18,109
so even third spring-loaded cottonwoods
anymore

85
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:22,750
you do this in a moment handcuffed by
pushing isaiah batman's aside

86
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,620
or by sliding

87
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,020
uh... something

88
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:33,020
interim billed as the other end of the
key and show the standard key

89
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:41,270
sis works great video anybody's

90
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:47,530
can this be fixed

91
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,199
or opposite scott okay

92
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,560
but you can imagine that doesn't smoke
most of the top of the key

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,560
and that is usually used to activate the
double

94
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:19,999
okay

95
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:24,579
here's another pic chose actually from
the prospects of which comes as a cop

96
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,539
so if you buy one of the is picasa gets
his nice inside picture visit

97
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,979
it is really nice class i think

98
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,558
you busy can see the same proxies in the
previous pictures as the other thing is

99
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,979
sees a couple of power

100
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:42,099
and the other thing is a spring-loaded
spring-loaded wretched

101
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:46,808
and he sees a key vote on both sides

102
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:49,300
everybody using to lock picking nose

103
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,740
if there's a spring-loaded mechanism

104
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,330
so it can be shed because of snow

105
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,680
nothing preventing people from going dot
as is our exit from going down except to

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,849
spring

107
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:04,610
so if you have been on bubble up stuff
what you can do is simply

108
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,529
sin piece of metal so it just like a
padlock shimla something like that

109
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:17,529
boarded at the same direction as the
bogosian possibly

110
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,769
no we don't have that

111
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,620
i don't know if anybody can see it

112
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,749
but the basic idea is to put in

113
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:35,340
slighted intended goes out

114
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,689
because is a metal

115
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,250
those are the sixties and so it doesn't
doesn't stuffed animals

116
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,470
but as i sat

117
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,769
of course it's only possible if nobody
and gets to babble

118
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:49,339
so the next question is

119
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:52,270
how do we get set up a lockout

120
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,479
okay police officers who is to keep

121
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,989
you don't really have to turn it into
opposite direction as for opening

122
00:07:00,989 --> 00:07:01,639
and

123
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,069
it's it's possibly go to know if it's
direction actually opens you handcuff

124
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,150
because those different positions of
some up and everything

125
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,870
the basic rule is

126
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,990
or they started so it goes to the same
direction is above moves

127
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,639
on this property

128
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,460
if the bold moves in here

129
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,110
we're tracking a sticky also moved

130
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,189
absurd no matter president of the law is
over

131
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:26,809
howitzer into its

132
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:30,149
plundering the double up we have to move
towards the other direction

133
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,900
so we take some

134
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,970
of peak like the normal

135
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,430
so everybody has is not picking set

136
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,489
and do the same icici would do serbian
side of the law

137
00:07:41,489 --> 00:07:44,039
movies opposite directions for opening

138
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:46,139
as a double lot they come out

139
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,580
it's easy on some models like peerless
for a speedy

140
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,758
it's a bit more difficult on this uh...
disinvest months because they have

141
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,339
touches tighter tolerances

142
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,060
but it basically should be reformed when
every stunned at the top

143
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,319
you have to try to get

144
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,039
as secretary and second eleven ten

145
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,289
half your time

146
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:06,009
after the open to the block

147
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:08,879
because of course to the same with the
standard lock civic and moves easily

148
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,199
pick

149
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,969
at the same direction is a key was cool
would go for opening

150
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:19,269
but you also can nations across souls
the usual defused a

151
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,689
is opens the prophecy

152
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:23,749
opens double a pacific

153
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:25,599
exemptions a cop

154
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,498
uh... position if you have it if you
just have fun picking up of course to do

155
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:34,010
both things

156
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,539
but still eternity

157
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,159
just use a key

158
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,469
because carrying around to lock pick

159
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,970
usually is more difficult in carrying
around a key

160
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,610
so if you have to handcuff key in your
pocketbook

161
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,880
whatever the new pocket bike hidden
somewhere in your clothes

162
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,850
you've got arrested illegally

163
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,030
i don't expect to hear it from the side
of the room

164
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,280
it's much easier to get out of keys and
to get out antarctic antics a cop so

165
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,370
it's basically

166
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:04,440
relatively pointless to pick standard
pass

167
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,200
this is a comparison chart

168
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,820
showing some of the keys and cello
somewhat handcuffed brands that was

169
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,010
awesome german bonds into because i
didn't he do it

170
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,510
as you can see the if t heat the current
schabel case kiki

171
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,350
green means of open to it

172
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,980
basically opens or the cops yet in our
test

173
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,950
as a keystone loses

174
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,040
so for example if the hyatt keep which
is a bit larger

175
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,949
but not open the cops or try to get a
hold of the pianist keo offer a speech

176
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,000
he

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,300
dismiss invest in cuba so isn't that for
the u_s_

178
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,980
and he would basically be able to open
all spend that handcuffed the police and

179
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,360
police might use unusual

180
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,400
obviously

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:53,880
so some meat for higher security

182
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,170
which actually is good because it makes
things more interesting for us

183
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:03,750
so what what has happened to to increase
the security of stand at hand

184
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,890
one very simple mechanism that's
possibly many of your body scene

185
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,060
is to changed from a chain had

186
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,259
that's what they should do

187
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,960
change from a chain handcuffed

188
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:20,960
two against one

189
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,040
that something like that

190
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,490
if this is applied in the rays that he
quotes are facing events from your hands

191
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,840
like this

192
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,930
it is very difficult to pick it

193
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,150
so you don't need a high security
cylinder anything it's just difficult

194
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:37,920
if you have sticky so and to have put
figures

195
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,689
if there is a possible to reach around
so it takes a key include footage on the

196
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,180
side of the can escape

197
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,580
what they also have time

198
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,110
especially high it's just a few others

199
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,890
is instead of having one off-season
ratchets

200
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,510
the spring-loaded bonds

201
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,910
makes it a piece of it and puts the next
to each other

202
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:03,480
so when you try to undo this issue are
not taking pictures of local something

203
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,080
you have to get to put shots to only get
one of selections and other once they

204
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,710
stop so they had couple open

205
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,740
it is not very relevant to us because we
should they handcuffed and shooting two

206
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,560
others get on the flip

207
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,690
ed burglary

208
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,630
so

209
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,580
what did he do to prevent prevent
everybody from tearing around to

210
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,510
handcuff key

211
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,550
sea-change is uh... shape of sticky into
shape to keep going so they are

212
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,600
and governments around the just use a
different key

213
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,460
still the same for all other handcuff
assist brent

214
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,730
but is different from the standard key

215
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,920
get picked video

216
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,589
okay at work

217
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,440
so

218
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,720
m if you really think you might be
arrested in an area where they use these

219
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
as a key uh... handcuffed you should
inform yourself

220
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,890
rich pc user

221
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,919
or if you have a friend whom i can't
help you

222
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,999
you should know

223
00:12:02,999 --> 00:12:08,430
which model as he has and you can
basically ought to get hold of the key

224
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,940
so for real high security

225
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,300
to actually added

226
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,970
real high security cylinders to
handcuffs

227
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,370
so if you know forgot picking

228
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,400
income dissident assert you handcuff the
speed of the cylinders

229
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,270
which has a different team

230
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,870
on each handcuffs

231
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,930
so this one key matching one handcuffed
and if you buy another one you don't

232
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,440
have a matching tee

233
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,230
sort of courses backed

234
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:38,230
for skipping

235
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,080
so here's the first one vis a

236
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,270
at income dissident

237
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,900
uses it to kill a lot

238
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,510
like many know from bicycles also

239
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,430
but it's only has four pins

240
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,940
anti falcons only have to adapt sells sa
sixteen different keys

241
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,560
that's much less than four use a bicycle

242
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,279
and

243
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,240
forms these sixteen possibly keys they
only used if you

244
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,160
so maybe all of these handcuff out there

245
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,540
have sustained key of c_ and q_ normal
on

246
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,910
and to get the probable raise it
everybody can buy it to make the

247
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,780
restricted key which is a different
different kinoshita becky

248
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,939
which only must is to do some

249
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,710
agencies or whatever

250
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,690
but that's not a real problem

251
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,060
because of course there are high tech
two is around to her to circumvent

252
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,420
guerrilla cylinders

253
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,350
fourteen dollars which high-tech tools
are available to open to listening to

254
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,160
his

255
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,199
well you would

256
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,200
the contras a high-tech too because its
top secret

257
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,920
i guess i'd like to

258
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,979
so as this was some better-known bicycle
locks

259
00:14:10,979 --> 00:14:14,350
indecent props to press conference at
the top of and pat

260
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:17,640
jig lived around the country basically
impressions along

261
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,930
so that's not a very good thing and have
stopped using these cops

262
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,580
amateurs they stopped using it because
of this others say because of her to

263
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:27,990
have a because that you can bring it
back to operate then you had to keep

264
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,690
because you have to inserted right from
the front so

265
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,100
i don't think those are really used
anymore

266
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,720
but to maybe around

267
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,980
they replaced business model

268
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,690
which went back to a standards mechanism
so it's

269
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:46,660
back to the normal lock receivers
directions just have to push down

270
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,770
but the change to keep it that much if
you can see pected

271
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,710
but sick he has a shape like

272
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,720
this

273
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,640
so it doesn't look going up

274
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,220
and under logs they added something
which makes it hired more tight

275
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:02,820
so and all that you don't fit

276
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,770
and picking is a bit more difficult
because you have to get into the tie to

277
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,550
keep a

278
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,620
buckets again the same he fought
handcuffs and you can buy these so to

279
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,790
get a vote of one of these keys is no
problem at all

280
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,050
so we get to something

281
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,730
more secure

282
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,940
susan australian product

283
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,260
it was used by that u_s_ marshal service
i think i'm not sure if they use it

284
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,500
anymore

285
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,290
but that might be a route because

286
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,199
summer board and you see the movie day
from time to time so that obviously have

287
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,680
been used

288
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,620
because it can come to a locksmith spins
on both sides so that's not a pinch of

289
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,540
the bottom

290
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,140
and just pinged from from about

291
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,960
uh... back again

292
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,559
and i don't know by that is

293
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,750
it's the same to you for

294
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,839
so if you have one key it was open all
of these cops

295
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:56,890
since the nineteen fifties

296
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:00,170
it's often at the very difficult ki and
he actually can pick it

297
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,370
and he actually can't pick advent
handcuffed

298
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,540
if it's just sometimes the important
thing is

299
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,920
you see this

300
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,530
this market convert eight it rotates by
ninety degrees to lock and by nineteen

301
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,600
what it used to top it off

302
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,809
if you want to pick it if you are if you
open it to keep

303
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,550
you looked right at the same direction
more and more than two goes back up

304
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,650
picking is much he's given to turn his
office at the rich

305
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,270
so you go from top it off to a normal
off by picking it

306
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,260
said you can't go any farther

307
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,520
but you can should

308
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,540
so to open this you pick it wants ninety
degrees opposite direction adds a new

309
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:39,900
shipment and it's

310
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,130
this is a model from england

311
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,710
which is the route for

312
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,480
there quite some time

313
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,240
and support the desk vapor cylinder in
it

314
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,210
so you have to stand up and have to sign

315
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:54,790
but this time that handcuff key hole as
you note of the picture

316
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,680
and addition to this incident date below
the handcuffs

317
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,120
having the seventh this clock

318
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,260
you see the key is normal

319
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,060
know mickey like you have been cabinets
or something

320
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,419
but seven discussed quite good

321
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,460
to close them do apply the normally in
center of the key to double up them

322
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,880
to open them so you have to pick them up

323
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,300
anthony would need a moment handcuff key

324
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,810
equipment of on-site visit singed on

325
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,480
so just chatted afterwards but picking
them up

326
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,730
rent handcuffed it's a really hard and
no people did it

327
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,020
i tried it once and almost succeeded i
can pick it close picking if cope with

328
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,750
the might have more difficult

329
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,860
so they're quite good spot

330
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,100
they're not very used

331
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,830
very much seems to use a u_s_ soldier

332
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,799
wasn't you'll recieve

333
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,510
so let's come to real high and low xx

334
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,490
i think many of air you here have

335
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,910
a id

336
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,990
seemed to medical talks we had already

337
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,870
and actually accompli edit medical rocks
to handcuffs

338
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,990
so that is the advertisement

339
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:04,010
they had at the kid to chew at the
moment handcuff into tessa

340
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,990
medical cylinder

341
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,520
on pop so it's hard to keep up with a
medical student id

342
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,350
simatic for peerless but most of the
village was miss invested so for the

343
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,740
major brands services kicked into or the
senate completely finished as a as a

344
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,890
high-security tough

345
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,620
for those interested in locks

346
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,290
besides the medical cut medical up

347
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,970
so also evident asset this model which
is uh... at office three slightest on

348
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,510
each side so also quite high some rights
uh... some high security

349
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:42,510
and they are both very hard to pick
cylinders fucked lucille etc

350
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,270
through the picture of both of server

351
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,639
one of the season that i read with the
medical appt

352
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,680
and the other one with the is a normal
smith and wesson this as a decimal

353
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,840
so he's he's basically living very hot
plastic part

354
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,379
rosie

355
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:02,100
moccasin

356
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,659
exists uh... locked operates the moment
he pitches inside to handcuff

357
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,169
so possibly if you would be able to
break apart the plastic

358
00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:11,899
which is very hard to do what you

359
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,630
possibly kagyud without tulips

360
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:17,590
he actually would have to handcuff key
which also asthmatics

361
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,629
but you don't have to do that

362
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,710
if the government has not sent

363
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,500
two cylinders development

364
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,900
so without the bubble up it just should
the cops as any other cops

365
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,050
but i think offices knows that good
problem to cox

366
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,408
so locked

367
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:37,420
as a second shot on the key

368
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,740
sontag doesn't hold in any raise double

369
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,150
so might it be possible to get out

370
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,909
within the next semester afzal dot
blotting bar

371
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:51,260
it is

372
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,290
so even if those are so high security
cylinder ans cops

373
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,129
and is one of the best student is
available

374
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,230
until yesterday

375
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,590
you can get out this out

376
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,360
using the senator paul

377
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,020
so the cop is applied to stop a locked
and all you have to do was hemorrhage

378
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,360
gary hart

379
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,630
on some ground

380
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,590
the right direction for that is to use
the

381
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:24,590
moving boaters op because the double or
comes from the

382
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,770
because the problem problem is that

383
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,910
from there

384
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,090
so you have it in this direction

385
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,610
and to double up stinks but out so is
the only thing of it right this is a

386
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:46,020
demo yet so i have some they pressed for
time constraints bc

387
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,470
i know a couple of click off using

388
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,390
it too

389
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,430
so now it doesn't move anymore he hates
fixed

390
00:20:53,430 --> 00:21:00,430
i'd have to do it off this because i
think it's too

391
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,869
i can mike and shows us a few times
later on the diamond so but it's

392
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:20,499
it's really a global run your profits in
the just record of it but possibly put

393
00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:21,470
someone's

394
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:24,200
it ticket to show and as there are so
but

395
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,870
it basically bergston cuffed

396
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,070
i think also can be picked

397
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,139
this is the medical n_c_r_ sod

398
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,770
someone yesterday picked the medical
echo no fees here

399
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,650
public relations to that

400
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,220
i've picked to ask of on yesterday you
think you hope except

401
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,520
so

402
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,370
it's doing buckets if you're a cop it
would be quite difficult i would rather

403
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,950
have her on something instead of

404
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,810
uh... peeking at that time

405
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:56,639
so

406
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,620
one of the solutions to to really cops
someone to confiscate

407
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,680
and sexy

408
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,540
the hinge version is already very good

409
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,470
if you're taking hinge version which
doesn't have to keep all in the center

410
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,200
part of the site

411
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,989
and is applied in the red sea

412
00:22:11,989 --> 00:22:14,159
keyhole is back from the hands

413
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,450
and if they decide to some so thick you
know it would be

414
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,160
but it's really very hard to get out
even if you have sticky

415
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,809
visit had to pick said forget it
completely

416
00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:29,490
if that's not enough and possibly if
they know that it's not enough

417
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,299
they invented the side to dodge there
which is a metal cover

418
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,340
it's placed over the cops

419
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,830
adventist topologically topologically
attached to it was a chain

420
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,550
which is around you raised

421
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:45,379
puts a change we go back to the texas
there

422
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,600
so the only looked at on your back into
handcuffs and the front

423
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,330
anti lock off to handcuff was completely
hidden

424
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,080
if they're not double optic and
shouldn't than anybody but it's a double

425
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,020
up

426
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,280
insist constellation you pretty much
lost

427
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,129
want to be a more simple solution

428
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,990
usually is

429
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:08,360
actors and the complex mock reciprocal
mechanism behind it

430
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:12,010
okay sings for listening to this very
short talk but sorry we have to start

431
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,600
time constraints

432
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,640
and i hope some people come back
afterwards to the

433
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,880
now to the cousin of the carrier and i
try to take a few short questions of

434
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,580
time in those

435
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,580
so thanks for listening in

436
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,630
are there any questions

437
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,780
it would be a real

438
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,168
arnaldo on

439
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:47,429
are very interesting presentation you go
almost the hand of saddam like dot

440
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,830
i noticed you do not have been the or it
may have you seen any of the it you know

441
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:57,379
transport it's been two versions of the
child uh... handcuffs now actually have

442
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,120
post shop and tough dismissal fee free
to come down to the to the picking area

443
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,880
okay does it shop that sparked the
so-called pic

444
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,760
not realistic when handcuffed

445
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,830
sausage at the chop escorts and such
opted ten image as a stand-up chopped up

446
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,580
in it

447
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,100
mystery levers if you know but that is
that might not like it or not

448
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,580
this and i can't pick

449
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,139
even vent handcuffed

450
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,390
okay i'd like to see them of that do you
see that

451
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,400
more questions

452
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
okay then thanks for everybody and feel
free to come down right now to the for

453
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,439
the second level

454
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,440
ivory what the cops and some clues and
to try some standing in some picking

455
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,750
momentarily

456
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,039
laszlo

457
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,920
your mc trends into

458
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,260
secret life of secret
