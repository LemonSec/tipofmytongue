1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,560
are being the least 20 minutes before
you can use this anyway so don't stress

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,390
about it

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,939
make yourself at home here feeling
because so it works

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,830
so OK um my name is Doug Spink and I'm
giving a presentation corporate

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,870
jurisprudence

6
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:17,270
are I made the title really boring

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,390
up by design to sort themselves like
people out

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,949
and that we the people come here kinda
really wanna come here talk about this

9
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:24,420
stuff

10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,330
but I'll tell you right now it's a it's
not as boring the talk world let's not

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:30,560
talk for small but it's not as boring as
is

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,370
it seems like arm I just try to scare
away the people who

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,169
we're gonna just come for an exciting
title and then be like wow this is due

14
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:38,969
till the morn

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,649
the real title but I should've use ever
want to have more people shop on Sunday

16
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,559
morning is packing corporation law for
fun and profit

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,820
this is way sexier you know I call while
fun and profit

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,329
but that's kinda been oversell does not
ruin talking about anyway

19
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:56,850
but usually oversell what you talking
about a min figure people shopping

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,890
no other here than I can leave mmm

21
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,479
so my name is Douglas Spink and I am
talking about corporate jurisprudence

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,390
what are really talking about is
basically the set of rules and

23
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,270
guidelines by which corporations exist
globally

24
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,810
and a kind of a different perspective on
how to interface with corporation law

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,600
and corporations and what corporations
can do

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,310
um in this kinda for fun and profit

27
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,350
but mostly just cuz it's interesting to
learn how stuff works

28
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,140
I think so are all about going on me
because

29
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,890
I guess I was like to know I'm going to
perform the same guarantee

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,890
its survive fall down that's what
happened is this

31
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,329
theirs is power cord here that's go

32
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:44,740
are okay this is commissioning

33
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,380
I'm at work yeah

34
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,869
should I don't be acceptable wanted to
air guitar and stuff

35
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,930
good microphone thats

36
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,560
sour then we come up a little more

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,820
okay little more that's getting
everything okay

38
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,090
with this yeah that's way better cuz I
these on

39
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,540
yeah by the way thanks for showing up
but this ungodly hour

40
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,629
the day because yes it's earliest I've
been up in forever

41
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:21,030
but that doesn't count something
Washington State so it's like a

42
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,190
in a clock and I'm normally up in its
orbit its cuz I'm going to bed

43
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,660
arm okay so I wasn't talking about
talking about corporate law

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,260
and are talking about a different
perspective on corporate law and then we

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,290
can go back on and why am because I
always figure it's nice to know who's

46
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,890
standing up for talking about stuff

47
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,200
are mostly see you can judge whether I'm
told for crop or not

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
and I may be told if a lot while the
lights just

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
security and okay that sorry so exciting

50
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,480
a I may be full crapper not but here's
my background I

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,140
job business no we r I want the other

52
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,440
okay that's fine I um I have an
undergraduate degree in cultural

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,379
anthropology

54
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,569
which is incredibly useful for this kind
of thing are

55
00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:11,159
I E and you had my first visit from the
FBI was 12 years old

56
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,140
soul maybe that counts I

57
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,519
get out it's not about story for time
again I'll tell you but involve credit

58
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:19,629
card numbers and

59
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,190
incidence and ordering goods over the
internet before there was an internet

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,540
and lower box

61
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,489
but I learned at that time actually when
I was 12 in the FBI came and visited and

62
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:29,489
talk to my parents

63
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,840
my parents told me in rat me out they
just said I there must be some

64
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,459
incredible mistake it was in our son

65
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,830
there's no way he doesn't even have a
computer my rooms for computers upstairs

66
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:41,569
we go check his room %uh know it's
really messy she got there but

67
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:44,489
it's totally wasn't himself I mean
that's what I learned from my parents

68
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:44,849
don't

69
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,640
Raju friends out which is just explains
a lot of the later stuff I'll tell you

70
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,670
up so then No my father was a successful
entrepreneur

71
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,930
who passed away last year and so I grew
up in an environment where

72
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,030
entrepreneurship in starting companies
and stuff was sort of in the water

73
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,790
my grandfather on my mother's side of
the family started a company that was

74
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,489
sold to do part plastics

75
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:09,700
the main the first commercial fiberglass

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,909
my grandfather on my father side sold

77
00:04:12,909 --> 00:04:16,120
Bell Helicopter was won the governor's
Bell helicopters and soul that two

78
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,739
Boeing

79
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,900
%ah and then one of indeed crazy stuff

80
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,360
with Applied Chemistry so I kinda come
from a geeky background

81
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,910
always like to say it's in both sides my
pedigree um

82
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,580
and then I after undergraduate I want to
read college

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,810
and I did my degree in anthropology even
though I suppose to be a physics major

84
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,750
I hope I went to university cargo and
got a master's in business

85
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,990
administration

86
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,509
in marketing and finance and

87
00:04:42,509 --> 00:04:46,639
had a great time there and a pretty much
I went to get my MBA after read because

88
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,400
I decided that I want to learn all this
stuff works

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,370
and %uh being kinda geeky instead of
figuring a disco get a job with

90
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,470
corporate you know whatever

91
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,410
and I start to have a career I thought
why wanna learn the rules first

92
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,360
right I mean I wanna learn but how this
stuff works like to learn how to work

93
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,380
around them

94
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,949
because that's all he's while you learn
the rules you can learn how to get

95
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:07,090
around them

96
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:11,690
and %uh so I got my MBA from Chicago and
I spent %uh six or eight years

97
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,500
um between corporate life and %uh
start-up life

98
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,680
I was sought by at the time the youngest
of a consultant with the Boston

99
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,229
Consulting Group

100
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,130
Tom acquit two weeks which was also the
fastest a consultant never quits in the

101
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,039
Boston Consulting Group which is

102
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,009
sorry the office was a guy who hired me
he's now the CEO the power

103
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,110
in Seattle I was apologize to my talks
are in your another commit a look really

104
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,090
bad because he really

105
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,440
you know stuck up for me and then I quit
um and then I did a buncha startups

106
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,650
and I made a about a hundred million
dollars by the end of the nineteen

107
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,889
nineties in the dark on craziness

108
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:50,259
and I bet it all in telecom turnaround
with an ATM back all

109
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,330
wholesale my

110
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,389
also minute I technology in 2001

111
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,330
and I will use financing round coming in
on the morning love

112
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,620
September 11th 2001 and so when I call
them

113
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,300
my C of O to see if the financing it hit
he said no but something else at

114
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,680
and anyway that was a long and slow
decline till

115
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,110
by the in 2002 a bankrupt lost
everything cuz I bet it all

116
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,580
I did actually bet the farm there was a
reform and I lost it so a real he says

117
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,289
don't bet the farm why didn't

118
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,900
I lost it so site that was funny that
that phrase actually has

119
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,840
overall form um so went bankrupt and
then

120
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,240
a a bunch about stuff happened in my
life and let's get started

121
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,580
smuggling a narcotics large-scale to be
honest a

122
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,210
with a helicopter smuggling operation
based out of British Columbia

123
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,639
the kinda weird transition I guess but
that there you go

124
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,030
um is really fun in by the ritz really
bad don't

125
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,080
don't do drugs don't smuggle drugs it's
bad I kinda make light of it nowadays

126
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,940
but it's not because it's a funny thing
it's because you laugh it

127
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,130
bad stuff right but it is bad and

128
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,360
I'm not proud of the fact that I was
involved in it at all

129
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,960
%ah at the same time it took
responsibility for it in his will was

130
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,990
and that was really fun at a certain
level if you ignore the rest a bit

131
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,160
use helicopters and you know
cloak-and-dagger site phones in cryptid

132
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,199
communications that we did all this
stuff like my being a movie except it's

133
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,509
%um it's real

134
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,560
and it's really scary cuz word about
going to prison for us your life

135
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,699
so that's not as much fun at all
speaking of

136
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,090
a wanna my customers in Seattle ended up
by wearing a wire for

137
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,270
to the DEA and I got caught

138
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,448
part I tend to be rolled direct and
honest about the stuff because

139
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:38,880
if you google my name it's right there
anyway so like why pretend

140
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,870
um I got caught in Monroe Washington
with 369 pounds of cocaine in the back

141
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,449
in my truck

142
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:48,910
and I I told him was for personal use
and they didn't believe me

143
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,060
of really bad cocaine habit

144
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,190
%ah you need the accident my father's
when those times and you make a joke and

145
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,900
everybody just sits there and it's

146
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,669
who bad joke sorry not funny isn't some

147
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:04,770
I make jokes and really inappropriate
I'm sometimes

148
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,289
a and the I said I want my lawyer went
to prison

149
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,440
and a for reasons that I will not talk
about in any public space

150
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,780
I was fortunate %uh to um

151
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,490
to receive a three-year prison sentence
for that and one count

152
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,740
of possession is what I was so plead
guilty to

153
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,190
and I did my time in prison FTC SeaTac

154
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,849
and FPC Sheridan if anybody else is on
federal prison time

155
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:33,189
a no going fun and

156
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,110
yeah it was interesting and then I got
out guidance and anybody else to present

157
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,050
myself

158
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,130
and though there are two newspaper
articles in particular that say that i

159
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,219
cooperated

160
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,070
I did cooperate in pleading guilty and I
actually played you know

161
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,480
corporate against myself so theories
that

162
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,350
on little sensitive about that because I
tend to get confused in some the

163
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,070
newspaper articles with the guy who was
wearing a wire on me

164
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,350
and people actually use his name to
explore for to me like a war that was a

165
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,209
guy that turn me on no no it is a
newspaper that was you know

166
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,149
was he's in with witness protection now
on not because to me it wasn't me it

167
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,240
into it

168
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,260
so now that no mine have been for a
while I'm really genuinely clean

169
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,800
and I don't have a lot of good current
stories about smuggling

170
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,220
because I'm Mowbray remove from the
world and that was the commitment I made

171
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,250
to everybody in the dealers that I would
get out of prison and get back to doing

172
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,230
good stuff

173
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,149
and not get tangled up in that again and
I'm not so I stand up here without any

174
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,149
other secrets

175
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,670
or concerns and don't approach me and
ask how you can get involved in

176
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,899
smuggling yourself

177
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:36,240
because actually can't tell you cuz I'm
not involved anymore

178
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,690
think is really dumb like you know I had
a helicopter pilot actually email me

179
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,269
once and said he wanted to get involved
in smuggling to give them a connection

180
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:47,700
no want by the way don't go into crime

181
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,040
you suck at this it's not work

182
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,130
just not how you get into it by the way
usually madame excl abuse like a

183
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,230
complete with such a dick

184
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,339
war sorry my bad hope you like present
this

185
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,560
still fun any weight so that's me %uh

186
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,490
I'm also about collapse doctoral
candidate in complex systems

187
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,790
with pros to university I was admitted
law school twice but never went

188
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,779
soldiers that I know I really should
have gone actually I had a chance to

189
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:18,380
finish law school the University of
Chicago

190
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,260
because I was admitted there without
actually applying the team to said we

191
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,209
should smoke and finish your degree

192
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,630
and a distance in Chicago anymore and

193
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,390
St back that's really the school would
have been fun and then I was admitted

194
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,800
Lewis & Clark law school

195
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,959
um but then it started smuggling drugs
and in time to law school

196
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,829
some which is kinda weird now try to get
back in

197
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,790
talk to the demands can I come back now
their little hesitant about that

198
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,959
I don't know why I can imagine it was
that it was the biggest case in

199
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,290
in Washington state at the time and yeah

200
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,579
they were um anyway offline I can talk
about sir some the mechanics the case or

201
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,959
whatever but that's no I'm here

202
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,260
that's who I am %uh that's why I'm
talking about the recorders Britain's I

203
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,180
have kind of an interesting background I
think from the perspective of

204
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,089
I I know quite a bit about corporate law

205
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:09,300
from an academic perspective cuz I did
study a quite a bit

206
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,250
at the verses cargo was cool during my
MBA just almost ended up just going once

207
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,890
going fishing there

208
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:18,300
and I don't want startups in have worked
with a lot of international

209
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,579
corporate structures in my career I as a
principle as a board director

210
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:28,269
as a CEO as a CT oh I'm actually
qualified as a financial expert

211
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,519
under sarbanes-oxley to I can be a
member of the Audit Committee a publicly

212
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,329
traded company

213
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,490
because my MBA from Chicago and

214
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,480
I've been a either terminal board member
I think five publicly-traded companies

215
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,240
in my career so I've done that the
public company thing to

216
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,310
and I've been imprisoned and smuggled in

217
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,209
and then convicted of a criminal offense
for which the maximum penalty is life in

218
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,740
prison without possibility for all

219
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,889
so a gonna see both sides other love
this

220
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:59,620
the map from that I'm not an attorney i
do not %uh pretend to be your attorney

221
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,079
I'm not give you legal advice

222
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,490
if you do choose to take this is legal
advice and go do something and get in

223
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,110
trouble

224
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,939
and blame me you're an ass it wasn't me
I didn't tell you to do it and I'm not

225
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:12,129
your attorney and I have had people
actually claim in court previously that

226
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:12,589
I was

227
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,370
acting as their attorney because I
talked about something no no no no no

228
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,189
I'm not an attorney

229
00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:20,370
and if you get in trouble it's not my
fault and I will help you

230
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,910
um yeah because specifically I'm going
to tell you that I do not include you do

231
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,910
anything stupid

232
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,329
in particular and then I get to the real
stuff I never won

233
00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:32,750
we're going to talk about corporate her
sprints and corporate law and

234
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,170
a the question will come up and probably
some other people here are thinking

235
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,599
I know a that they will learn how to do
core cool corporate stuff center to pay

236
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,839
taxes right does anyone fessed up to
that

237
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,850
went up like but my assets overseas on
to pay taxes you know what is going to

238
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,639
fess up to it now

239
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,420
30 you can about it ledger up to it and
said you're going to do this

240
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,740
every would raise a hand hewn unity it
don't do that I

241
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,209
you need if you do that for two reasons
number one it's kind of a dick move not

242
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:01,060
to pay our taxes if you live in a
country

243
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,180
is your you know taking making benefit
of the

244
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,740
the you know the the services here
number two you're going to get caught

245
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,329
because the IRS in the United States at
least it's pretty badass and they have

246
00:13:11,329 --> 00:13:13,930
all these abilities to ignore laws and
do what they need to

247
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,699
so if you think your gonna hide your
assets overseas and get away with it you

248
00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,230
might but it's mostly cuz they're just
too busy to catch you

249
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,540
and you don't have enough assets to go
after are I did

250
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,980
prison time a lot of guys who went down
for tax fraud mostly

251
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,040
chiropractors and dentists on the North

252
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,579
the good news was I had a really well
adjusted back in prison kiss home

253
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,720
months ago practice you know I do is pay
me back Rahman and then

254
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,139
adjuster back I'm but they they always
tend to fall for this don't you know

255
00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:43,809
don't pay taxes to the overseas stuff
the IRS will catch them

256
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:47,509
and the IRS is also it's a super special
powers to catch people that normal

257
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:51,430
serve corporate people don't so if you
think your gonna hide your money

258
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:55,040
overseas from the IRS and everything
else I do I strongly

259
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,790
discourage it and i genuinely discourage
I don't do that myself and money to

260
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,500
student doing

261
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,620
however wanted you here today can be
used to do that

262
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,110
and I'm honest about that my pretend I
mean it's a vulnerability these are the

263
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,550
these are bugs in the system in a sense
i'm talking about.

264
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,500
and they're real and there there you
have to make a choice is a human being

265
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,519
not to use them inappropriately

266
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,610
both for ethical reasons and because you
get caught gonna be trouble

267
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,370
go to prison in person is not fun so um
and then the second thing is

268
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,529
%uh that a corporate law it doesn't
really have a right and wrong

269
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:30,949
embedded in it and and consequently you
can use corporate law do bad stuff

270
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:34,059
this I am going to ask this question how
many people think that in general

271
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,649
corporations are bad

272
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,399
okay good thank you

273
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,600
how many people think computers are bad
K

274
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,910
got it I'm I'm gonna halfway there
myself a

275
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,889
I kinda think I'm in the same way for
the following reason: in this is really

276
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,839
important my pitch today something good
start pitching my pitch

277
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,389
corporations are good or bad they just
are

278
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:01,130
okay corporations can be used all sorts
a bad stuff and people who lack a moral

279
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:03,420
compass can use corporations to get
around

280
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,509
you know rules and and moral
prescriptions

281
00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:09,670
and do stupid stuff that has real
consequences that a negative

282
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,160
but corporations themselves it's just a
body of rules

283
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,050
its algorithmic and I eyedropper all to
computers in the computers can do all

284
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,259
sorts a bad self to

285
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,220
right if you put computers and you know
the Pentagon and the use them to

286
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,069
monitor everybody's communications
that's kinda bad

287
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,790
presenting two years old is it you know
its what you use it for

288
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,969
and so i i really pitched people they
say the corporations are neither good

289
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,750
nor bad

290
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,470
they are there a system that you can
learn to use and if you learn to use

291
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,600
them intelligently can your you can
learn to use it

292
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,939
to do good stuff right as you can hack
the system not

293
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,500
I you know to do you both be able to do
good and I think that's kinda the fun

294
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,569
part a corporation law for me and and
corporate jurisprudence and everything

295
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:51,240
else is that

296
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,959
when you learn how to do this stuff to
give you serve extra-special superpowers

297
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,089
that you don't have otherwise and it
really does I mean I'm gonna buy me tell

298
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:58,790
you why

299
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,179
understanding corporations it's like you
have super you have god-like powers

300
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,299
genuinely god-like powers saw

301
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,839
so for small don't don't try to avoid
taxes

302
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,799
by doing overseas corporate stuff and a
second of all don't use

303
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,839
overseas corporate stuff to laundered
proceeds of illicit activities

304
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,100
like drug smuggling I did not get
charged with

305
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,860
money laundering and it's because I
didn't do any money laundering

306
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,160
so that's why are if I would have

307
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,709
bien pushing money from smuggling
activities overseas through bank

308
00:16:31,709 --> 00:16:33,949
accounts using corporate structures and

309
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:38,620
nominee directors and living trusts and
everything else which I know how to do

310
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,480
when I got caught they were charged with
money laundering and I would have done

311
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,779
way more time for money laundering the
needed for the smuggling

312
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,470
even though I got caught with a huge
quantity of cocaine so that they

313
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,189
he money laundering a lot third really
mad about it a lot

314
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:56,139
da money launder um don't take proceeds
of crime and try to push it through

315
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:58,769
overseas corporations because boy they
get pissed off

316
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,779
normally get pissed off the dock at you
because if it has anything to do with

317
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,260
the DEA by the way

318
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,919
they don't have rules anymore the DEA
can do whatever they want really

319
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:07,659
legitimately

320
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:11,939
whatever they want vacancies overseas
bank accounts they can compel overseas

321
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:15,620
a governments to turn over information
about

322
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,909
companies domiciled in there area they
can break into offices in just take the

323
00:17:19,909 --> 00:17:20,490
records

324
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,949
they have guns are I've seen all this I
don't say this to criticize the DEA in

325
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:25,409
fact

326
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:28,639
I don't really think they're in you know
in intrinsically evil they don't set the

327
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:29,700
rules that is for them

328
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,690
mostly but they have powers that
everybody else doesn't have

329
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:37,040
so I'm gonna tell you some things today
like you can do this and you can do this

330
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,879
and then somebody

331
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,820
you know somebody can't do this and
somebody can't force you to do that that

332
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,480
somebody has a star behind it

333
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
and the stories except the DEA because
they can kinda do anything

334
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,909
and it's good to remember don't assume
that you can hide stuff

335
00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,540
overseas and they'll never be able to
find me cuz I'm so clever

336
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,620
if its illicit you know criminal
proceeds they can find you and that's

337
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,790
it's a footnote to go see everything I
say today and %uh

338
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:02,530
so anyway I hope somebody in here isn't
thinking gonna teach you how to hide

339
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,080
your money in the Cayman Islands

340
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,820
I can teach you how to do that cuz I
don't know everything I know the DA can

341
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,168
get through

342
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,110
actually know people who know how to do
that and do it for a living but mr.

343
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,580
Cantor who they are and I'm not gonna
give you advice about it

344
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,799
some and I don't stay in touch with them
anyway some I don't know

345
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,360
with your anymore I this a and then
finally and then we're going hear this

346
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,630
this presentation follows up on our
class I taught in entrepreneurship in

347
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,610
federal prison for

348
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,899
most of the year as a volunteer him when
I was in prison in trying to think of

349
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:34,659
good things to do to partially make up
for being a dick and getting caught

350
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:35,740
smuggling

351
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,870
I thought well maybe I can teach many
other folks in federal prison

352
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,669
some things I know but entrepreneurship
so that when they get out there not

353
00:18:42,669 --> 00:18:43,960
struggling to get a job

354
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,139
you know is a convicted felon and they
might be able to start a company or do

355
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:47,970
whatever

356
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,309
and %ah and it was a really good
experience I'm it's really great people

357
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:52,668
are still friends

358
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:55,980
and some of them have started the
companies that are really successful

359
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,770
and I really hope that some other most
are these freakishly successful

360
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:01,070
companies that only overshadow anything
I've ever done

361
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,189
maybe they'll mention me someday my guy
who taught me prison

362
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,830
is really amazing experience we had you
know white supremacists Crips bloods

363
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:13,699
on you name it all sitting in a room are
a whiteboard

364
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,740
no books no materials no internet access
to research anything

365
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,740
no research materials and rainfall
aboard prisoners

366
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,909
that could be watching TV or watch me do
my schtick

367
00:19:24,909 --> 00:19:29,190
appear and so for four hours a week I
will try to keep everybody at least

368
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,289
entertained enough to not walk out or to
start yelling for the back to the room

369
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,539
speaker dick

370
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,139
stinky sock he thanks vitiated so

371
00:19:38,139 --> 00:19:41,520
I was the girl never have a crowd as
tough as the crowd in prison

372
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,918
%uh and its kinda go because you just
learn to take it all in stride

373
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,169
um and they I got asked a lot about this
or overseas stuff right

374
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:53,250
I mean over the you've all seen the ads
in magazines or her to me talk about

375
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,139
overseas corporations

376
00:19:55,139 --> 00:19:58,500
used in overseas company to
international and IBC international

377
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,629
business corporation

378
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:02,639
you can you know shield your assets from
creditors to a bar

379
00:20:02,639 --> 00:20:05,800
we've all heard about this stuff some
other folks sitting as you probably know

380
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,340
I mean what about this already some love
you probably don't care

381
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,418
some love you are curious and always
wondered how it works I get asked about

382
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:16,290
this a lot my students in class and so I
finally did a class on overseas

383
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:17,678
structures

384
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,399
just from scratch with the caveat at the
beginning don't use this to try to hide

385
00:20:21,399 --> 00:20:24,129
taxes because you'll end up like doctor
had action

386
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,780
doctor so its own doctor so-and-so who
do near doing time for tax fraud

387
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,908
so that always worked in prison really
well as you can point to the people

388
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,440
um you know I get onto this is bad the
economy

389
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,190
um miss your chiropractor could point to
go out to his car practice

390
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,919
tell you because they get the call
themselves doctors but they're not

391
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:42,649
really

392
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:45,919
that's why I think the separatist of
them

393
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,760
I you know I don't get it I think
they're OK um

394
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,200
so okay that's a that's kinda my back on
page it took up way too much time

395
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,659
I think but it helps to kind of set the
tone um

396
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,840
corporate law I'm not gonna a

397
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,100
the lecture too much you're going to a
little bit about probably 10 or 15

398
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,159
minutes background

399
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,909
10 minutes schism burned too much time
and then Billy 22 Q&A

400
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:12,570
a I N eyes i'm talking ask questions
really this is not

401
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,658
I don't have slides or whatever I by
choice

402
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:19,860
I don't dumb down two slides because I
wanted you guys to read much as Liza

403
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,809
just promote given to you and you could
read them

404
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,950
you need read them to you really robbery
dollar self

405
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,500
um oh yeah also I

406
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,429
I i live in Washington state on a farm

407
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:39,020
um and I i guess im kind of unusual this
actually ties into how I approach

408
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:39,840
corporate law

409
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,869
and I'll try to convince you this have

410
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:47,139
a kind of unusual lifestyle in that some
my primary physical

411
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,570
emotional yes and social bonds are

412
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,360
with horses and dogs so my family is

413
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,419
really mostly composed of dogs and
horses my life partner

414
00:21:58,419 --> 00:22:01,429
were been with for 10 years in um

415
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,280
is a a famous athlete and a very
successful

416
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,690
has his own fan club and umm-hmm

417
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,040
pays a lot of the bills are on the farm
actually with his with his work

418
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,550
he's also got four horns and a tail he's
a

419
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,440
showed a pic stallion name 21 um

420
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,869
and anyway he was actually I

421
00:22:23,869 --> 00:22:27,720
kidnapped two months ago and is being
held for ransom right now

422
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,059
and yeah that's a whole other story if
you want to google my name to find all

423
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:31,730
that stuff out

424
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:35,000
yeah it's quite freakish deal and

425
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,350
by the way although advice from the last
session about how did your the press

426
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,990
that's really good advice

427
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,409
it's really good advice because I've
been interviewed on ABC news and

428
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,590
everything else about this thing lately

429
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:49,760
front page %uh this Global Mail in
Canada Obama bomb

430
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:52,740
and %uh that's really good advice that
is given you I mean is everything he

431
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,149
said it was like yup absolutely
absolutely absolutely

432
00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:59,629
but I'm probably one of the few people
that has been interviewed on ABC news's

433
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,980
a your wife an ass know what it's like
to have a a

434
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,450
a partner who is of course just like you
know it's me hi

435
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,720
I I'm I was joke about that and say

436
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,830
it's actually cool because I can always
say that my boyfriend really is hung

437
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:15,379
like a horse

438
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,659
usually blush like you can say that I
did I said it

439
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:23,330
morrow sorry about it so I've got a
different lifestyle I live in Barnes

440
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,418
actually and with the guys and have for
a long time

441
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:30,399
and I think that the fact that I grew up
in kind of an unusual

442
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:35,070
personal space colors the way look a
corporal of other things because I tend

443
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,059
to look at systems

444
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,210
and how they work and try to understand
them kinda as an outsider looking in

445
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,360
and and don't automatically assume that
systems always gonna be used for what

446
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,159
they're intended to be used for

447
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,280
which is prolly high enough in the
contactor world broadly defined

448
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,600
because I find an intrinsic joy and in
learning how stuff works

449
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,530
and then %ah working around the rules
because it's way more fun to work around

450
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,330
the rules I think than just a break them

451
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,740
you don't really need to be all that
creative to just break the rules and

452
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,700
after you're doing smuggling for a while
you can realize that

453
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,230
it so it's not as much fun to just
ignore the rules is to follow them but

454
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,610
do creative stuff

455
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,899
within that context and so if you think
about it i mean rules say

456
00:24:14,899 --> 00:24:18,149
and but now we're gonna be in the
corporate stuff yet there's a lot of

457
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:20,480
stuff about how corporations work

458
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,210
where it says you you can't do this

459
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,830
and you can see this you can't do this
this a must statutory law

460
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:30,639
you guys know they're sticking to its
statutory and common law know this is

461
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:31,950
something that to

462
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:36,340
I did in prison are it's important a
statutory law is the

463
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,570
laws that governments pass that are like
Britain

464
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,490
a statutes ir section 861 dot 33

465
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,740
the definition love arm

466
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,899
a narcotics offenses such that's bob of
its these are things the government

467
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:54,010
actually pass their loss

468
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,158
and we think most people think about
laws is like that that will that was

469
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,360
alright

470
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,940
well that statutory law the statute
surpassed and then there's common law

471
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,260
and common-law is what people refer to
general in the time a precedent

472
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,809
common-law is a cases that have been
adjudicated by a court in a particular

473
00:25:12,809 --> 00:25:14,000
jurisdiction

474
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,090
and to one degree or another there's a
principle that has come out of

475
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,559
case like your USB Lawrence or

476
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,290
USC powers which was about search and
seizure on narcotics cases

477
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:29,090
in that actual case save me about 10
years in federal prison

478
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,830
so I really like that one is an example
and that's a common law principle that

479
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,799
came out of USC call us

480
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,899
on and a common law and statutory law
together kinda far the rules of law

481
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,790
it's difficult because there's no place
you can go to sort of look up the list

482
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,230
rules of common law because they're
kinda scattered around all these

483
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,040
rulings in cases in civil court that go
back to like the Magna Carta

484
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,750
in England and so every once in a while
you'll be talking to a lawyer about

485
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,059
something and we're in this massive
litigation

486
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,080
which actually involves international
corporate structures about Capponi

487
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,970
my body who got kidnapped because he's
actually owned by a company based in

488
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,200
British Columbia

489
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,240
that itself is owned by an overseas
corporation basin is a chance

490
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,179
and are so it there's all sorts of
weirdness about that

491
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:20,320
yeah it's also weird that he's owned by
somebody

492
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,559
because you're traded XO than your head
that

493
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:27,109
turned his gun owners but it's not me um

494
00:26:27,109 --> 00:26:31,109
the horse yeah this is the horse he he's
owned by an investor group

495
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:35,090
and has been for a long time and so they
there's a lot of confusion actually in

496
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,240
the press about

497
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,590
his ownership because I was referred to
him as my course

498
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,030
well he's technically no my horses owned
by corporation

499
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:46,840
you know ya but I mean who are the real
owners the corporation

500
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,859
yeah but who wants a corporation well
that's a different question

501
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:52,428
well no it's not because they're the
real owners the horse other not the

502
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:54,440
corporation owns the horse

503
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,639
well and one score person action other
corporations a corporation well that's

504
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,940
all we that's kinda shady notes none

505
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:03,149
well you know you need to tell us who
the real owners the horse or okay so let

506
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:06,330
me explain the meanest and this is
somebody stole something from Microsoft

507
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,699
with your first question people who the
real owners Microsoft

508
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,740
we meet with the real owners of
Microsoft's not only shareholders

509
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,649
really change every day used if
Microsoft you still from Microsoft not

510
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:16,980
from

511
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,679
all the individual shareholders about
its basic unblock and yet I've been in

512
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:21,619
arguments with

513
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:25,010
people who should know better about this
in the last couple months no no no I

514
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:28,270
mean the shoulders are the real owners
the corporation is just a sham

515
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,250
and 1 answer and that's really central
to what I'm talking about today

516
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,609
are but anyway if you talk with lawyers
about stuff though often cite common law

517
00:27:35,609 --> 00:27:38,480
that goes back to like the 14 hundreds

518
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,710
residue to cover whatever arm now

519
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:45,080
his corpus which we used to have in this
country member used to

520
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,520
have that right and we don't anymore um
venom in these

521
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,899
yeah it's kinda crazy things I mean to
10 years ago she joked about that

522
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:53,490
everybody would be like I B word

523
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,629
but it's true we don't got overturned
you don't have a right to

524
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:01,080
have like a judge look at your case
anymore as US citizens

525
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,899
eek accused of committing a crime in the
United States

526
00:28:04,899 --> 00:28:08,350
americans look you up for ever that's
scary to me

527
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,960
because I've been locked up are and at
least if you're locked up in this kinda

528
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,929
system around you

529
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:17,320
you have some idea what you're dealing
with and hopefully have a release date

530
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,299
some other guys an overly states that I
2163 missus bad

531
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:25,450
think move while you know this one guy
actually got sentenced to

532
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,040
224 225 and

533
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,839
it was a mess case in newsies young guy
and he came back from something was

534
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,800
broken up

535
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,619
on what you get not working so i neva 25

536
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,649
so it's not really that bad and I mean
if you do the math that's like you know

537
00:28:40,649 --> 00:28:44,359
October 07 you get a good time take a
few months off and then it's like in a

538
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,199
May 07 you got halfway house

539
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,510
twenty-five years oh wow again Sorry
have

540
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,240
thats bad that's a lot of time um

541
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:57,730
so a but if you have a system around you
at least you know to dealing with and

542
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,169
losses habeas corpus means that they can
just look you up if they don't like you

543
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:05,050
and I somebody who is not like a lot of
people that scares me because I'm like

544
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,658
the first person listed la copa think it
is lockup

545
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,349
for no reason is an actual doing wrong
of people who like me to the whole

546
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:16,240
horses thing um so a congress common law
and statutory law and that's what

547
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,710
governs how corporations work

548
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:22,879
and common law and statutory law and as
my title says to the

549
00:29:22,879 --> 00:29:26,359
to the speech vary by jurisdiction

550
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:29,750
whenever for jurisdiction in talking
about the country

551
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,950
okay that that the water supply in and

552
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,379
this is where we start talking about the
nuts and bolts of how

553
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:39,909
corporal of its the other is a system
and rather than me starting at the

554
00:29:39,909 --> 00:29:41,070
bottom in working up

555
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:45,109
yeah I was like a sort of definitions
basic principles a purple or whatever

556
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:49,189
I try to start the top and work down is
if you go to law school and study

557
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,679
corporal are you you do that from bottom
up

558
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,320
and takes a long time to see the big
picture and so my goal today

559
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,300
in relatively quick period here is sort
of a push down

560
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,609
to give a big broad overview of how all
this stuff works at a very high level

561
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:07,700
all ignoring what are the details um and
that doesn't mean we'll know all the

562
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:10,349
details million it today but at least in
a little bit

563
00:30:10,349 --> 00:30:14,379
I corporations exist in the context of
jurisdictions

564
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,109
jurisdictions are basically the country
that you know that that your

565
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:22,179
that you talking about on those 181 184
countries

566
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:25,429
in the world in some weird
principalities like singapore is a

567
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:28,980
principality your city state or whatever
does that count as a country or non

568
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,770
tells the city state anyway you know I
think it does kind in the country

569
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,720
but there's some great year there's
actually gray areas are what the country

570
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,839
what isn't in this

571
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,720
there's corporate law issues likes the
bar I I think it's

572
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,690
in in the a in the Caribbean is an
interesting corporate jurisdiction:

573
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,280
because it's sorta governed by Dutch law
sort of

574
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,300
but is not a Dutch colony anymore cuz
they don't really have colonies

575
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:57,520
right um but kinda still is because it
doesn't really have its own government

576
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,550
yet sort of so if you have your
corporations based there you're in this

577
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,149
sort of interesting gray area where
you're kind of part of a separate

578
00:31:04,149 --> 00:31:07,349
country but not and then if things go
really bad you can always go to Dutch

579
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:10,710
Notre to Holland and and in use in other
ones law to

580
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,109
you try to make sure your rights are
upheld um

581
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:18,060
that's each other like that too it's a
British principality

582
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,240
in the Indian Ocean I know what p.m. a
principality among international lawyer

583
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,260
like that but

584
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,339
at it it's not really its kinda its own
country accepted

585
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,770
operates in the British common law and
almost kinda under British rules of

586
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,690
civil procedure

587
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,520
so if you're in the Seychelles and you
understand British common law fairly

588
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,030
well

589
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,379
that's more or less the rules apply in
the Seychelles and that is why people

590
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:40,470
like to do business there because we all
kinda understandings common white with

591
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,230
green you get more or less the benefits
of English common Law

592
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,619
without some other drawbacks about you
being incorporated in the United Kingdom

593
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,030
itself

594
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,560
on some jurisdictions where we're
talking about physically

595
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,480
but not as much physically is what rules
were operating under

596
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,260
because you got common law and statutory
law and %uh those

597
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,310
common sense for our principles only
playing given jurisdictions if you think

598
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:03,869
about stove pipes

599
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,119
on like france has its own common-law

600
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,399
in stock story I mean every jurisdiction
as dutch door lock is there the pastor

601
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:11,210
was right

602
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,379
you can read those there's a kind ZZ
every jurisdiction is common law

603
00:32:14,379 --> 00:32:15,790
provisions that are built up

604
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,589
you know over that over time and %uh
france has its own set standards it's or

605
00:32:20,589 --> 00:32:21,329
common-law

606
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:25,520
basis and does anybody know what thats
called in France like that this report

607
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,480
precepts a common law in France the
absolutely the Napoleonic Code

608
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,000
which gives you an idea for talking
about here and some other stuff is

609
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,909
actually go to fight initially by
Napoleon and his advisors

610
00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:38,909
as basic principles of law now back in
the day

611
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:42,280
when used in the you know the whole hold
your hand like that thing

612
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:47,030
um and the they're still in a in effect
would agree at least the principles are

613
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,319
I does anybody know the state in the
United States whose common law

614
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,069
about foundation is actually the
Napoleonic Code in not English common

615
00:32:54,069 --> 00:32:55,010
Law

616
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,079
nicely done while it's crazy you got a
definite geeks

617
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:02,950
normally ask you people that like what
half the room you that here yes good

618
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,569
yeah Louisiana for sure and that makes a
big difference if you're doing you know

619
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,589
corporation stuff in louisiana because
all the common most often talk about

620
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:10,950
under English common Law

621
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:15,069
a kind it doesn't apply for in louisiana
which is crazy like this forty nine

622
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:16,359
states and then there's louisiana

623
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,909
Nate they operate in a poll on a code
you've gotta be kidding me that's

624
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,010
bizarre new my law professor first told
me that I thought he was joking that

625
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:22,800
cannot be funny

626
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,119
but it's true welcome on still be
bullshitting me know it's true I mean

627
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:27,679
I'm so to me in a book like that

628
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,599
oh my god it's true on there's also the
weirdness like that and in law and

629
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:33,339
that's partly what fun

630
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:36,658
anybody in your study Latin anybody
right

631
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:39,970
Sophie if you study Latin you learn the
rules

632
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,040
but easy part thing early exceptions to
the rules that's what really matters

633
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,480
East online if you're gonna have proper
grammar

634
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,629
Cooper was a lot like that when the
rules when you learn exceptions and

635
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:52,899
in louisiana's exception so
jurisdictions are where a company is

636
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:57,109
is is based I and then let's do 33
minutes on

637
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:00,159
what companies are are when a

638
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,290
when did corporations or corporate like
structures

639
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,750
first come into being

640
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,780
anybody roughly on today

641
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:15,659
year earlier I think it was much more
like the seventeen hundreds right

642
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:19,109
absolutely it was kinda the English they
came up with this during the age of

643
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:19,790
empire

644
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,800
and the Dutch were surely you know
coming along afterwards

645
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,300
and here's the deal the the English in
this at least I know this particular

646
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,079
example

647
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:30,669
the English wanted to encourage people

648
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,839
there's also some continental examples
there's a day back like the sixteen

649
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,040
hundreds but I'm not going to get to
tangle and

650
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,980
hissed and store in a corporate
structure would be able to do is really

651
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,079
well but I'm not

652
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,200
um the initially wanted to encourage

653
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,429
I traders to I'd yeah develop

654
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,099
their Empire and and in like %uh for
Southeast Asian

655
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:54,530
and they want to come up with a way to
encourage people to

656
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,540
invest money in

657
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,859
treating projects with the

658
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:05,069
with the Empire held components

659
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:09,759
um and in in Southeast Asia right and
the if you're if you want a shipper

660
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,810
something you have to take a risk
sending a ship there to get spices or

661
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:15,660
whatever in the bring back to England in
his own spices make a lot of money

662
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:19,399
but a big risk and the problem was the
back in those days

663
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,270
you on the ship yourself personally and
if things went sideways in the ship's

664
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:25,430
anchor something in your people money

665
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,118
the other two persons there are still
life debtor's prison

666
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,280
member you to juggle a debtor's prison
all that exists

667
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,490
actually still have them in England
which is just weird um I love you end up

668
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:37,790
in debtors prison anymore because it's
not supposed to

669
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:41,329
count but there is still technically
debtor's prison in England as somebody

670
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:43,510
who sings to me explain this to me

671
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:46,819
arm %uh and I anyway so if

672
00:35:46,819 --> 00:35:49,950
if you owe if you went bankrupt and
something went bad

673
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,868
and your people money you were hit for
life like you there was no

674
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:57,020
there was no bankruptcy in fact it was
you was like your name was on the

675
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,540
you know on the documents you are you
done and so if your ship sank

676
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,589
going to today East India or wherever on
a training mission

677
00:36:05,589 --> 00:36:10,180
and you dole's money always people you
do but you know you're

678
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,629
your shot so people were not really %uh
that interested in risking everything to

679
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,460
do these trading

680
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:19,220
adventures soul whichever Queen was
Queen at the time

681
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,290
somebody who's better at history than at
NUMMI can say

682
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,790
wanna be a was a bus probably as my
guess um

683
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,810
they want to come up with a way to
encourage people to take more risks

684
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:33,578
financially with I by knowing that they
wouldn't necessarily personally be on

685
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:36,210
the hook for the rest of our lives is
something wrong okay that's the

686
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:38,030
foundation of corporate structure

687
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:41,240
really core that's my argument um other
people might see something different

688
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,270
that's my argument sticking to it

689
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:48,270
the idea was to make a turkey to create
a solid floor above

690
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:53,259
the bottom the max or the sealing the
maximum risk that individuals would take

691
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,050
in making economic bats on on business
ventures

692
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,420
and corporations evolved out of that
basic principle that we want to you

693
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,940
shield a certain degree of unlimited
downside liability for individual people

694
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,619
to encourage them to invest in risky
ventures

695
00:37:09,619 --> 00:37:13,800
de matters because I that still the
principle applies today to corporations

696
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:17,099
and that's the principle that underlies
all corporate law is you're trying to

697
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:20,470
create corporate structures encourage
people to take risks by minimizing the

698
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:23,240
liability that they face if things go
wrong

699
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,210
so that one of the core principles above
corporate law is that there is a a

700
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,910
there's a there's a split between
personal liability

701
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,828
and corporate liability and one of the
key done

702
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:38,630
components of corporate law is that die
yeah um

703
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,589
you know can I schedule question to
corporations

704
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:49,589
or people have more indeed like human
beings have more rights under law

705
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,670
%uh kinda yes there's a good the

706
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,859
absolutely the theory is that the human
beings have like in a human rights and

707
00:38:00,859 --> 00:38:01,799
stuff

708
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,490
%uh that was kinda to question because
the answer is the corporations are

709
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,390
treated as people under English common
Law

710
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:11,529
they are fictitious people and sometimes
in a conspiracy theorist talk about this

711
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,680
kinda thing you think you know whatever
that's not true

712
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,790
but in fact that with the way that the
that the system was hacked when

713
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,520
corporations were created

714
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:23,599
was to you making these a fake people up
out of thin air

715
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,800
and I and treat them as people are I

716
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,020
that's actually true now there's been no
some constraints but around them in some

717
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,560
limitations in this cover privilege

718
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,349
and there's some details a corporate
privilege that have avoiding all the way

719
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:35,200
from people

720
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,750
and people have like use to anyway have
habeas corpus rights and corporations

721
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,630
don't

722
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:45,020
on stuff like that but at a club or
basis corporations are fake people

723
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:49,140
it doesn't mean that they're bad evil
people or that you know either fix a bad

724
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:52,950
you just accept that they are there
their basic framework on corporations

725
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:55,230
and English common law and in the polar
code

726
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:58,980
is that they are like little artificial
people is the phrase the using

727
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,630
in in like textbooks except the kinda
different people

728
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,280
because they never die right by me know
these natural ice never die

729
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,119
and you can put in prison my paper
corporation prison

730
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:14,020
theoretically you can actually revoke
their charter and I make them go away

731
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,380
but that never happens it should but it
doesn't anybody see the %uh the

732
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,260
to a movie the corporation sweep its be
popular movie

733
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,150
its kinda cool I like that the only
getting like about it i think is pretty

734
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:27,380
accurate is that they should have denies
all kinds of the corporation and as I

735
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,460
said at the beginning

736
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,579
why denies the concept learn it and make
it better or used to do good stuff

737
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,369
corporations are artificial people are
there created out of thin air

738
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:40,119
when you make a corporation you go to
the jurisdiction you chosen

739
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,150
which could be the United States or
France or wherever we choose into

740
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,270
quick jurisdictional you know details

741
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:49,609
arm and you create a person out of thin
air

742
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:52,290
by signing a document with the
government the government says we're

743
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,410
gonna create a new person

744
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:56,578
and it's called corporation so and so
you know so-and-so Inc whatever

745
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,680
this pretty much is the same in whatever
jurisdiction in the world you're making

746
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,629
corporation

747
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,670
used to be that getting a corporation
created required the Queen herself to

748
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,950
sign off on it like in the seventeen
hundreds

749
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:10,500
there's a big deal nowadays you can just
you know do it online for her box

750
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,990
which is kinda crazy you can create your
own people you can make the people are

751
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,150
thin air and you can

752
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,470
%uh and I i into god-like powers

753
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,569
%um you have got like powerful
corporations because you can create a

754
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:23,558
person

755
00:40:23,559 --> 00:40:26,710
out of thin air that is fake and has no
human rights

756
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:30,030
in is like the perfect slave in that
sense because it's not you know doesn't

757
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,020
you know it's a

758
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:35,250
treated with respect and you can make it
do stuff whenever you want

759
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,420
it's like you're puppeteer behind the
scenes and you can make it do stuff

760
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,569
on your behalf and then if things go
really wrong you can cut the cord and

761
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:42,180
leave it is

762
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:45,549
you know to sink or swim on its own and
say well we're not my problem

763
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:51,069
i disown you I mean thats weird but true
that's what corporations are

764
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:54,109
and I that is the way the system has
evolved over time

765
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:57,339
and its to its it's a god-like power

766
00:40:57,339 --> 00:41:00,520
because you're able to make creatures
that you can then control there some

767
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,619
constraints are on that

768
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:05,660
if you use corporations to do obviously
criminal stuff

769
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,089
like money laundering or whatever then
the law will go blow right through the

770
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:09,808
corporation

771
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:12,309
can come at you personally whether
you're a director and officer

772
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:16,180
shareholder they just a start they stop
pretending the corporation as a person

773
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,250
and they just come after you and put you
in person

774
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,579
on does anybody know the technical
phrase when that happens

775
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:25,680
peers in corporate veil exactly and you
hear that a lot in

776
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,410
and corporate law to peers in corporate
veil that vary by jurisdiction but

777
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:31,490
broadly defined if you do bad

778
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,569
and/or sloppy start for the corporation
and

779
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:38,130
are you don't follow the rules then you
lose the privilege of having a

780
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,020
corporation

781
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,200
as a sort of a person that stands in
front of you and they breach the

782
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,690
corporate veil and then they come after
you personally

783
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,440
up with respect to jurisdiction and they
will do acquittal privacy thing and then

784
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,099
five minutes a questions

785
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,309
you can choose where your corporation is
incorporated

786
00:41:53,309 --> 00:41:57,000
is Chris Chartered is created these are
all the same words anywhere in the world

787
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,720
does your corporation have to be
incorporated where it right where it

788
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,839
operates

789
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:06,109
is it better if it is re

790
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:09,759
seven minutes over can read I think you
might Mizani works closest

791
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,390
go okay %uh no a.m. is it shady if your
corporate someplace other than where you

792
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,569
operate

793
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:19,650
now it's really not people say that %ah

794
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,920
yeah our show corporations bad

795
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,760
no are the one that has like such a bad
energy to it in fact there's this

796
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,530
articles are written about me that
accuse me of being involved in a web of

797
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,300
shell corporations

798
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,780
might I know that means a web show
corporations know that is corporations

799
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,250
show corporation II by definition is
Commission doesn't have any assets yet

800
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:44,329
doesn't mean it's like evil or its shady
rat dodgy sony acid yet it's just kinda

801
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,079
vanity shell

802
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:48,040
so let's every corporation wants first
created basically is a shell corporation

803
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,420
and then you put stuff in it

804
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,420
corporations have to components to them
and whatever jurisdiction

805
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,619
they have the owners unless a nonprofit
in which case they don't

806
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,550
I'll and then they have the board

807
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:05,300
of Directors ahora defined the owners
are the people who have

808
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,670
sort of the economic interest in it um
with and then the board of directors

809
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,260
is the people who are responsible for
making the day-to-day decisions

810
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,510
with respect the company on behalf of
the owners um

811
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:20,609
ed do the owners and board members have
to be the same

812
00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:24,130
K are do you have to disclose

813
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:29,720
when you create your company who the
owners are

814
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,339
outstanding trick question it depends on
what jurisdiction and this is Chris

815
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:35,000
Corder sexual stuff

816
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,890
juror why some things that very what buy
jurisdiction are the common law

817
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:39,890
provision is operating under

818
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,240
the expensive creating corporation and
the rules under which

819
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:46,970
you have to disclose ownership in a
corporation to this the government or

820
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:47,780
whoever

821
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:51,099
there are states like California for
example where you have to keep this

822
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,089
state

823
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:55,119
appraised of all the owners the
corporation any changes in ownership

824
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,440
corporations throughout the duration of
your corporation is your

825
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,180
incorporated in California that's you
know if you have any surprises he

826
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:02,940
concerns

827
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:06,730
about life in general that's kinda like
whoa and then their states like Nevada

828
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,940
where the state doesn't even keep track
ownership doesn't want to know from day

829
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,050
one who the owners are and has no real
desire to you

830
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,460
poke its nose in and and claim it has a
right to know who the owners are

831
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:20,309
and then there's overseas jurisdictions
like then want to wear the C Charles or

832
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:21,099
whatever

833
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,599
wear protection over ownership
information is like a top priority for

834
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:26,109
the government themselves

835
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:29,950
lichtenstein are and they will not
disclose that information if somebody

836
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,309
wanted

837
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:35,180
our board members is a is it necessary
to disclose

838
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:39,230
and serve in public nature who our board
members have companies

839
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:43,329
in most jurisdictions yes it is okay
supporters are so the public face the

840
00:44:43,329 --> 00:44:47,140
owner sport the board stands in for the
owners and the board takes actions on

841
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:48,750
behalf of the owners

842
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:51,829
arm the board does not have to be the
owners

843
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:55,220
and a lot of overseas I jurisdictional
stuff happens by

844
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,980
having a nominee board which pretty much
every board is really

845
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,059
Anna it's it's a board that compose the
people who act on behalf of the economic

846
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:03,890
owners

847
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:08,009
and %ah stop okay that was a fast seven
minutes

848
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:12,809
well stop four minutes okay thank you
war

849
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:17,059
got it four minutes okay um hmm

850
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:21,240
it so the board has to be publicly known
%ah the shareholders don't

851
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,500
arm the shoulders not liable for the
actions the company unless the company

852
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:25,930
does bad stuff

853
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,308
companies can open bank accounts
companies can own assets companies can

854
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,220
invest in stuff companies can own other
companies

855
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,460
companies can be dissolved companies can
be changed companies can be bought

856
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,019
companies can be sold

857
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:40,450
by using companies in whenever
jurisdiction you choose

858
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,640
you can keep your ownership or whoever's
ownership of the company's private

859
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,348
if you own assets and you don't want the
whole world to know that you own assets

860
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,599
put them in a company pictures section
where the

861
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,069
the shareholders aren't spread you know
all over for anybody to see.

862
00:45:55,069 --> 00:45:58,808
and own the assets the company and then
if something comes out UN says why one

863
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:00,150
who really owns this

864
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,980
a business or this whatever are the one
who really owns the company does well

865
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,619
who really owns the company near god
damn business

866
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:10,640
and I i've had to have interviews lately
where people are asking who really owns

867
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,239
Capponi the company that owns good
morning

868
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:16,619
really owns Capponi well this company
exit point stones does

869
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:20,769
16 appoint stallions on your guide in
business all want you to tell us

870
00:46:20,769 --> 00:46:23,599
I'm actually as a board member vector
point stones constrained by

871
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:25,440
confidentiality provisions

872
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,529
in my board agreement with them but I
can't disclose who the owners are

873
00:46:28,529 --> 00:46:33,309
no be in breach of contract divided so
protecting the privacy of your owner's

874
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:36,069
is boys like protecting privacy have
anything else in your life

875
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:39,910
it's it's can be an intrinsically good
thing and I would encourage you to think

876
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:40,819
about

877
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:44,599
%uh any components realize that you have
our business ventures or whatever

878
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,190
that you don't necessarily or somebody
doesn't necessarily wanna be personally

879
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:51,819
stuck to as an owner %ah you can create
corporation wherever

880
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:55,109
or corporation that owns another
corporation wherever and put that stuff

881
00:46:55,109 --> 00:46:58,190
one step away from you while still
controlling everything that it does

882
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,420
through a nominee directorship and not
doing anything shady illegal or

883
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,210
inappropriate that so corporations were
designed for

884
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:07,769
um and then now final II comments and
then

885
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:11,430

890
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:28,920

00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:37,430
to that question

894
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:44,430
go ahead

895
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,890
cheeses I have no idea good luck with
that

896
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,288
move to a different country that still
has it like Canada

897
00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:54,499
it's funny because you know gave the
England has more human rights and we do

898
00:47:54,499 --> 00:47:55,589
now and member we

899
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:59,009
a had big revolution stuff because we
put our to the way they were treating us

900
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:00,519
no worse than they are

901
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:03,849
um thank you for listening to me ramble
I appreciated

902
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:08,529
any other questions comments on
preparation stuff is actually really fun

903
00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:11,049
you can learn how to do it and you could
you please call for corporations don't

904
00:48:11,049 --> 00:48:12,390
be intimidated by them

905
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,960
the way he is simpler than computers are
and the laws a corporate lawyer way

906
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,230
simpler than coding

907
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:20,579
so if you wanna learn how corporations
working probably due in a week

908
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:23,700
and then you could also do fun stuff for
them if you got any questions i'll be

909
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,349
around

910
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:30,740
this

911
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:31,050
thank you
