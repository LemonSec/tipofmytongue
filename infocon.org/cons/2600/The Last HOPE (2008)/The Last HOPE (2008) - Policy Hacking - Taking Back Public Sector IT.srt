1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,260
um a police more people's to float in

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,280
as we go but I'm gonna get started
because it's after 10

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,890
my name's encompassing Dutch a

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,190
in over the last 56 years I worked in
the Netherlands

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,480
was a and for other people to change
basically national IT policy

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,250
in the way our governments and public
sector organisations Mumbai in use it.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,300
I'm and I just wanted to share some of
my experiences and maybe some people can

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,710
use it to replicate

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,129
all slices you she will be put online
directly after this presentation

10
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:35,769
an R the last lines showed an increase
in getting minutes of course

11
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,550
Creative Commons license oh my basic us
rules um

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,389
understand now that you she was in
privacy in this country needs travel was

13
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:44,190
gone so

14
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,519
does a fine just non-league please am

15
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,568
switch off you know any nice making
apparatus to

16
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:53,909
mutes handed as I was saying firm

17
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,699
all he does is logically at Commons
license you can have some fun with us

18
00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:02,059
right I'm this is an

19
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:05,910
my experience in Evanston now working
with the UK Parliament and some people

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,929
in Berlin's many European countries but

21
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,980
it works in the Netherlands and in Evans
is part of a coalition of killing

22
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:16,140
I'm and we wanted two countries in the
world that still have the same

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,300
political a head

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,640
that in when the Iraq war was started to
even its most in a bit

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,640
no basic democratic functions are
lacking in your country

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,890
this can still work that's that's a
point am it takes a couple years what

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,080
to me in and for the voters a couple
years anyway um

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,470
and you need to be resistant to being
bored of once you get successful

29
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,130
and yes there is a business model in
there somewhere right

30
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,030
now policy documents when it occurs in
human events it becomes necessary for

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,940
people to dissolve the political bands

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,940
which is connected them with another and
you shouldn't among the present you have

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:54,870
to separate and equal station to which
the laws of nature and nature's God

34
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,620
entitle them

35
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,340
disrespect for the opinions of mankind
require that issue

36
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,600
to cause a switching impel them to the
separation he said for his words over

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,380
the US

38
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,079
Declaration of Independence if you're
not familiar with it some fun Washington

39
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,039
DC have nope

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,560
I'm and while I was researching is
actually

41
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,569
this is what I found from the US and
maybe if congress

42
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:18,739
a decade-old that actually

43
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,030
that policy document which is a good
pretty good policy document as

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,349
policy documents go was actually I'm
inspired by a dutch policy document

45
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:30,369
which was almost 200 years I'm

46
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,170
older where the Dutch a to people
declared themselves to be independent

47
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,269
from their den

48
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:40,519
ruler to Spanish king also by saying you
know you've messed up the situation so

49
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:41,590
bad that we now

50
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,709
you care such independence so from

51
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,889
once again that you've made a policy
document and I'm gonna be talking about

52
00:02:47,889 --> 00:02:48,810
that maybe

53
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,370
again this may inspire so many people
brightened somewhat computers

54
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,739
um -ism a decade older

55
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,359
a graph I a great debate from Carnegie
Mellon my arms more vac

56
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,419
and it plots early you how much

57
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,480
computer chip are you get for certain
amount of money is all

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,858
in inflation corrected sit back to many
7

59
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:13,519
so it's going to be hard to do now but
you see the point so

60
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
for over 100 years now we've been a
ramping up

61
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,739
computational power for a dollar at him

62
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,230
doubling every 18 to 14 months and this
is had

63
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,510
a massive impact of you know on
everything

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:30,450
we do and we are so this is an analyst
how you do your groceries

65
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,450
one other big grocer you can do
everything online now

66
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,629
is how we bank is that we get the music
well

67
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:41,219
you know in Europe actually just so we
get a music because I'm

68
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:43,950
in countries like Sweden and the
Netherlands downloading in a non

69
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,939
commercial context is actually legal

70
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:51,239
a.m. so we have no no not for computers
that can predict sports

71
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,040
events better than most humans can we
have cars that are fully autonomous

72
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,879
is heated up a challenge that was
receiving recently non-human environment

73
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,090
I'm and actually last year guy call

74
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,760
got a PHD by you know thinking about
that sort of a human

75
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,809
machine relationships for a couple years
in predicting we would

76
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:13,159
ultimately Mary a robust this was based
on the fact that eighty percent of the

77
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,739
room but

78
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,260
owners you know the room but a lil robot
vacuum cleaner eighty percent

79
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,560
room homers give their room by name
which is quite sort of like a pet

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,160
but of course the room as No in a
potentially intelligence oh it's you

81
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,540
know

82
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,400
he can spend four years thinking that
I'm get a PhD it's lovely work if you

83
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,060
can get it

84
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,130
and of course in one of the rooms but
don't go there

85
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,200
come we have a you know local

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,300
that factoring so in policy terms

87
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,480
pretty much up to this day um polish
make a stand to see computers improve

88
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,350
typewriters

89
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:49,120
hand for a long time that was you know
fairly accurate

90
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,620
on but really now we have to think of
them as much more their communication

91
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,230
devices especially allowing

92
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,230
privacy which is a good thing to have
the other way we protest and we organize

93
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,330
protests SS

94
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,349
citizens as people they are affects
release basically because they're now

95
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,220
becoming so small so cheap

96
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,050
with just a manufacturing I think I'm
becoming a factories and of course

97
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,080
there are some countries where we
actually still vote on computers and you

98
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,500
for Boston's get it fixed

99
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,750
I mean evidence me now don't have we
don't have computer voting any more

100
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,140
things to 12 people running around

101
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,580
and of course you can consider it to be
printing press I wanna

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,200
and I'm reading this a bit more because
it's central to rest my story

103
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,040
I'm haiti is the new printing press and

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,770
there is no freedom of the press and
hold the presses are owned by a few

105
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,159
organizations if

106
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
just read the drums the hardware that
makes a computer printing press

107
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,530
is owned by a handful of corporations 10
what does that tell you about freedom of

108
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,090
the press

109
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,630
I want the freedom to choose between you
know papa bear and pop be a junior here

110
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm so a in any you we have regulations
that say

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,310
no single corporation can own more than
30 percent of a certain media channel

112
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,460
because we want diversity we want choice

113
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,830
so well in television and newspapers we
consider

114
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,130
you know thirty percent dangers
concentration in softer space is a bit

115
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,990
different

116
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,360
-ism an example loveYa end-user license
agreement

117
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,130
should basically im Mike shift will sell
you from page which you can use to

118
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,180
produce very crappy web sites

119
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,850
I'm however they do limit what you can
say in those web sites

120
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,280
so imagine a park a corporation you know
selling you a pen

121
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,890
but then the box that the pen comes in
as a little sticker that says

122
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,690
you cannot use this pen to write
negative things about for corporations

123
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,270
or its affiliates

124
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:40,210
unit that will be you know we're but in
the softer space we consider this to be

125
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,830
quite normal actually

126
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,909
I'm so did something strange going on

127
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,970
so the normal way to governments have
been buying and using it. is very

128
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,840
it's very much at the operational level
so looking at the cost and looking at

129
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,120
managing projects you know risk
avoidance all those things

130
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,220
but because I T is becoming so sent over
everything we aren't everything we do

131
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,250
we need to look at other aspects of IT
basically other

132
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,340
other point so accessibility of
information to everybody not just a few

133
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,290
people have bought certain software

134
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,210
you know we monitor processes that make
the government to be transparent we want

135
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,480
as citizens we wanna

136
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,860
you know be able to to have a look at
them and see how to feel of course we

137
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,390
want our nation states to be independent
from commercial corporations

138
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:25,789
now may sound like a fire a dream but I
think it's possible under certainly

139
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,020
something to strive towards you feat
even if we never achieve it

140
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,740
I'll so well there's a whole buncha
reasons why would you know you might

141
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,370
like

142
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,480
a.m. you government to not be totally
dependent on technology vendors who

143
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,330
you know pushing stuff I'm for the basic

144
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,969
basic function so you know you just
picture your thing that you like

145
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,680
now how I got into this was a believer
coincidence

146
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,150
hmmm January 1st 2002 left-right you
woke up from a stupor

147
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:58,630
I heard when to them for national rebuts
National Railway web sites to plan a

148
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,150
trip

149
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,900
as I always do firm and on that morning

150
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,430
I am instead of getting a planner we can
you know you type in a city where you

151
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,420
are to where you wanna go and it tells
you

152
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,090
know when the train is going in where
it's going and everything I'm

153
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,240
I got this and it's in Dutch Sony

154
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,139
unit doesn't mean a lot to probably
basically it says well this website only

155
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,570
works with Internet Explorer 4.0

156
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,340
the term if you don't have internet for
4.0

157
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,780
go here to download Internet Explorer
4.0 and I was using RedHat Linux

158
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,969
so that was a bit of a bummer so I
couldn't access the website that day

159
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,640
basically in let me in because I was
using the wrong operating system

160
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,348
now at this time in Europe in Brussels
European Union was

161
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:44,860
doing their antitrust suit against
Microsoft I was already

162
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,960
going of course in US had already been
convicted on appeal

163
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,400
so being at being a big user of public
transport in an event I was a bit

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,980
pissed about this whole situation sorry
wrote an angry email to date

165
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,930
webmaster if the railway saying look you
know you can force me to buy certain

166
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,200
softer texture website URL you guys are
public service

167
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,720
mostly paid for by my Texas an and you
know i i what I want access to this

168
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,080
information I think I have to

169
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,020
after dry I'm and then I'd finished a
man was about to send in a side note I

170
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,600
sent it to the webmaster thats

171
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,270
you know just got technology guy he
probably doesn't have a saying in any

172
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,279
policy

173
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,090
so I need to have the need to put some
people in the CC fields

174
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,890
so I went today apartment website looks
up all the email addresses of

175
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,449
members of Parliament who specialize in
information technology areas from the

176
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,890
various political parties

177
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,770
and then there were some other people
like the Minister for Transport and his

178
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,180
high commissioner and

179
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,620
you know the national Ombudsman thing
consumer groups in

180
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,330
so long and about 50 you know emails and
she she feel many quit because then it

181
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,520
becomes spamming

182
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,930
I'm innocent that of Anish after an
issue that is going to mail back from

183
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,730
the related

184
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,150
own at many complaints in a very sorry
and ever going to redo the website in 17

185
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,860
days later they will launch a website
and then it was pretty much

186
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,370
standards compliant um so that was nice

187
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,040
tonight a good plan my trip again but
the really nice thing would happen is

188
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,449
that one of the members of parliament

189
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,540
emailed me back and said look I've been
hearing about these kinds of things more

190
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,380
more so

191
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,400
but I don't need you know get did just a
bit so would you please you know

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,170
drop by some day in and we can have to
talk about it

193
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:23,089
so indeed and went ok you know became a
series of talks and discussions in

194
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:26,510
more people got involved and over the
summer really low temp

195
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,279
a parliamentary emotion should have a
proposal for a bill basically

196
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:36,290
and for stepping making something all
and on the 19th November 2002 that was a

197
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,910
adopted unanimously by the Dutch
parliament and it basically says two

198
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,560
things

199
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,600
first thing it says is to suffer market
is not working as a proper market it's

200
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,930
not an open market

201
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,520
where you know people gonna free choices
and she can sing

202
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,980
the way to remedy this is for the Dutch
government to use open standards and

203
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,960
open social for as much as possible

204
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,380
so you know we can have a more open
market that's the second part that

205
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,560
scene is most famous for but first but
basically says the current

206
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,839
supermarkets not function properly but
you can mean a desktop space

207
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,290
now firm mister finley Chism a

208
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,529
a member of the Dutch Green Party and he
got his

209
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,050
proposal adopted unanimously night if
you're dutch member of the Green Party

210
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,730
getting you know motions adopted
unanimously is fairly rare

211
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,890
he has this one you know in a frame over
his bed

212
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,460
because it's the only time in his career
he got that I think one of the few his

213
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,130
party's

214
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,839
so certainly am it's the first time on
the on the left there

215
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,550
and suddenly I was in his best friend
basically in you know we be calling each

216
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,940
other and I keep feeding in more day 10

217
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,480
nice examples to use in getting get
press and stuff like that

218
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,080
and then other people getting fresh from
other political parties

219
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,420
so we from the little band and we kept
it feeding each other information

220
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,469
no making noise in the media kept the
pressure up I'm

221
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,180
and basically what I was doing I was
helping these people to your score

222
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,490
political points

223
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:00,050
be visible in parliament in general also
within their own party

224
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,220
so and as long as you keep doing that
today will listen to you basically

225
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,560
and after about a year we got to the
point where

226
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,080
me in a few other people who were hoping
the same disguise

227
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,760
could just you know million questions to
ask to the Minister

228
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,500
and then they would ask them so we we
just i proper questions and I'll email

229
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,620
send them often and

230
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,630
forty-eight hours maybe we could watch
the live stream video from

231
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,660
Parliament where they they would be
literally basically meaning our emails

232
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,740
to the Minister for Economic Affairs

233
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,870
so was recall was reached on we had no
funding a political mandate was just a

234
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,570
bunch of people doing its

235
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,980
now depending on who you're talking to
in the political spectrum in this

236
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,270
interview old left-right

237
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,800
model which snub from becoming a billion
way but it works

238
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,830
on so depending on who you're talking to
you need to use different

239
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,390
said have fun a blue collar blue points
to score

240
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,430
now if you come to an end to the left
wing of the political spectrum

241
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:56,010
I'm you talking about things like social
inclusion and transparency processors

242
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,200
from neutrality

243
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,860
stuff like that you can be said in a bit
anti company chief if need be

244
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,000
now lower cost is something that
everybody likes but its it can be

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,630
difficult case to make certainly

246
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,930
when you're starting out in a migration
process it you may need to invest first

247
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:09,710
before you

248
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,180
that something back of markets is also
good thing that everybody likes me

249
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,730
nobody's really against you know the
proper functioning of markets

250
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,750
and of course local businesses if you're
talking about the

251
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,220
a Dutch DVD which is a sort of two more
I'm a is

252
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,740
compatible today to beige Conservative
Party

253
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,200
um their focus on entrepreneurs local
business stuff like that

254
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,510
now I've never really got good contact
was there was a right wing of the

255
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:38,640
a political spectrum but I would presume
to national security would be an area

256
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,730
for them

257
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,029
um dad Dutch phone tapping system

258
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:47,689
ish the proprietary software supplied by
an Israeli company stuff by

259
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,480
with most of people and it's plugged
into the Dutch phone systems and that

260
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,830
allows to Dutch government to tap phones

261
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,200
I'm body systems have the management
interface so that from Israel they can

262
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,550
be

263
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:02,930
managed but that's not to go connections
to them 34-minute

264
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,540
so you have to wonder what I've
management they do you know over 34

265
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,290
megabits immature optical

266
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:11,339
kind of course a lot of ideas that
basically as well as stepping

267
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,680
all kinds Dutch funds without Dutch
government knowing about it

268
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,470
now we kept basically on them on
occasion kept following all kinds of

269
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,990
government have processes in and
projects

270
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,550
to you know see if they would mess up
and we consider if and bring that to the

271
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,730
attention of people

272
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,399
so in 2040 seriously messed up there
trying to buy

273
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
almost on a $50 million euros yourself a
desktop software

274
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,750
and the only talked to a single vendor
now and you will you that's a big no no

275
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,010
assumes a government spends more than
about under the two in a thousand euros

276
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,730
you have to do you know it a formal
gendron process for various companies

277
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,680
can bid

278
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,860
on a contract and they didn't do that so
that was really

279
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,190
really bad and as luck would have it

280
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,360
it was a civil servant somewhere in the
bowels of one of the Ministry

281
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,990
was also very pissed off base and so
he'll call us

282
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:08,100
I am and basically leak this information
and to us on December 10th 2004

283
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,180
now of course we immediately called some
journalists in init magazines and stuff

284
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:12,959
like that

285
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,120
so next day decides can two-story and
then of course over the weekend rewrote

286
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm have questions the to be asked to
the Minister you know

287
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,770
what sounded what do you do 150 million
euro contract

288
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,319
to a a you know no bitch to a convicted
monopolist what's going on E

289
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:33,430
and personally maybe we met Slashdot and
bust December 17 the contract was then

290
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,399
what

291
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,709
so somebody bike shop didn't get that
christmas bonus that year so that was

292
00:15:37,709 --> 00:15:39,459
good

293
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,649
now your questions that rascal quite a

294
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:45,649
were quite severe and on December 30 s
their

295
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,610
term government for the first time
basically in answering these questions

296
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,420
admits that it was a problem

297
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,279
and of course we all know that who
summer going

298
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,390
I'm we all know if you have a problem if
you have an addiction

299
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:04,149
be to whatever you know controlled
substance or certain software

300
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm as long as you don't admit the
problem that has nothing to do so this

301
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,709
is a big break that the government says

302
00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:13,470
we have a problem and you'd option a
publisher softer and opened

303
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,769
a open standards is is the way out of
this and

304
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,399
actually used words like vendor local
monopolist stuff like that so this was a

305
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,060
big rate you invest you can build a
building location building to talk a

306
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,170
so we were getting quite should have a
big stack of papers of

307
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,380
fell projections things that you know
where you get too expensive or

308
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,439
it's an impressive was done wrong and
you better be good building in building

309
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,390
building them

310
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,779
negotiated you need to make it something
really that had some

311
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:42,110
meat on it now also the local level
we're doing to be able things

312
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:47,190
I'm and municipality of cloning which is
a a city in and also the Netherlands

313
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:51,029
um sort of in the center of the this
send a satellite photo here

314
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,899
I am they were about to do with a an
express contract renewal where they

315
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:57,589
would you know again tied themselves in
25 years of

316
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,830
myself best option an exchange just
right and

317
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,380
we got a tip by one up to a techie you
guys who wasn't very happy about that

318
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,600
and so

319
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,699
drove up there from and I had a chat
with some other local government people

320
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,150
and said Well you know basically why are
you buying gifts and officials must

321
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,230
follow you know

322
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:20,720
we were advised to do so well by you
well by defender

323
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,010
okay so you gonna give somebody 1.5
million euros

324
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,000
because they advise you to do so all was
betraying a bit strange

325
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,750
so we should all be no what are you
getting in terms of functionality

326
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,179
are you going to you know type up better
building permits was his new would press

327
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,520
Israel gonna buy

328
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,639
all you know what's are you gonna send
fast three males in exchange for what

329
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,580
what's going on

330
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,669
are you spending a million five which in
it you know in a city like that is

331
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,220
actually a lot of money

332
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,150
so I'm we said well no one just not by
just not spend it was just

333
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,960
used used to stuff you already have
because their licenses the wall

334
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,210
2003 Windows XP in that support until
2010 2011 so they were fine

335
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,240
so they said okay will do that well just
you know keep the money in a pocket

336
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,360
basically

337
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,870
I'm just a couple min in the bank and
havent will

338
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:12,150
higher if you people locally in a city
in this down as many

339
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,830
unemployment unit compared to the rest
of the country and so will create 40

340
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,629
jobs

341
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:19,910
and those people will then spend four
years

342
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:23,910
you figuring out migration scenario and
will use have to budget for that

343
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,240
so that was a good idea and then you
know in 2010 on

344
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,510
we can either by months of suffering any

345
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,940
fine you which is what we otherwise
would also give money to any badges

346
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,370
or weekend used immigration plan to
migrate away from a no one

347
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,049
no bite ever again and either way
whatever we do the fact that we have

348
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:43,750
such migration but I will be a great

349
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:48,360
you know way to negotiate good um every
action on your contract cost of course

350
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,780
because you just you know but these big
document on a table are you negotiating

351
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,590
with these guys and put a little

352
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:58,000
Linux you know lapel pin and you know
mark in everything you say okay well

353
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,390
now we have here migration plan it's
fully just said so

354
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,340
you know what and and this offers free
watch rough and of course be some unique

355
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,490
couple years ago that them a yeah the
question election you can get

356
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,610
on your contract can be as high as 150
percent

357
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:17,450
so that's nice they are that scared for
European shootings

358
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,640
migrating I'm it was another this is the
province of Khanh we just love the area

359
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,920
around in the larger

360
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,290
more to compare books about the US state
um

361
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,409
and it has a new it had a new a cheap
land and the only thing it said about

362
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,220
open source

363
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,010
was there is no support for open source
in this was in 2006

364
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,020
I am and then you know we

365
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,460
do some stuff um and made sure that they
had all these wonderful buzzwords that

366
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,010
you see at the bottom of the slide

367
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,940
in there and the difference between the
two is that four people went up there

368
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,090
in each truck for four minutes to the
Provincial Council that was it that was

369
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,230
the intervention

370
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,809
now it takes to date you can to prepare
that four-minute speech because you

371
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:55,570
really have to

372
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,030
you know get it right the first time arm
but that's it

373
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,389
that was all that was required we
basically explain to them look why are

374
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,910
you sending all this money abroad why
are you

375
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:08,520
China yourself into a single vendor you
know what's the advantage for you

376
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,730
and it was simply something they had
never considered

377
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,730
was simple as that and so we gotta and a
new policy plan was major by order of

378
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,530
the council

379
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:20,639
and it says okay we're going to be using
OpenOffice were gonna might be to open

380
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,530
standards

381
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,549
we wanted you know local a knowledge
economy was in free fall then

382
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:28,750
probably as much when they're so now
doing in

383
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,610
so then in a 2007 we had elections and M

384
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,169
we had a new worm a new economy in new
cabinet

385
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:40,280
and a new Minister of Economic Affairs
and is so this is a much younger guy

386
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,230
it fairly short political career before
it is so still

387
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,020
you know look knows what the outside
world looks like not totally messed up

388
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,090
by the political system

389
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,389
yet anyway and Jim and he happened to be
personal friend of one of the members of

390
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,010
parliament that we had been

391
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,299
mailing in talking less about five here
so meeting was set up

392
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:03,350
and a you know we decided to instead of
working with opposition parties

393
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:06,490
as for parliament want to talk to the
Minister directly because that might be

394
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,020
a lot more effective

395
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,418
so I'm so we need

396
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:14,940
so the first meeting missing you know
somebody was actual power also for us a

397
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,860
big moments

398
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,240
and moving up the political food chain
basically and we prepared is very

399
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,179
intensively two days and days and days
planned his meeting

400
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,440
I am because you know for most of us
suffer might be a very interesting and

401
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,660
important thing

402
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,900
up for economics minister minister it's
not the major Singh

403
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,470
if the Saudi ambassador knocks on the
door and says he wants to talk about oil

404
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,830
you're out so you know you might have a
meeting you might have a forty

405
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,678
five-minute time slot mind movement but
it may be cut short

406
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,929
at any time so you need to get your
basic point in their fast

407
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,830
use pretty pictures and of course not
just talk about problems to talk about

408
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,970
solution make it attractive to do
something

409
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:54,190
rather than nothing because doing
nothing is default position of most

410
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,290
democratic

411
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,710
people now you can give these people a
lot of information in short time they

412
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,850
tend to be smart people

413
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,730
well this this money some me your again
your management very

414
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,410
I'm be and we didn't course a message to
the information packet for his support

415
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:09,970
stuff

416
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,290
with a little more time to spend with
Justin because the minestrone up 35

417
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,799
minutes for us because yet enough

418
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,510
fourteen other items on its agenda that
they were something but his stuff

419
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,020
nearly eighty people that are advising
him and a lot more time for us so we

420
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,580
hang around at the ministry and spend it
basically the afternoon talking to them

421
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,939
that was great so I'm gonna show you
some pictures we use this was

422
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,250
our graphics guy make this this is any
amount of money

423
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,590
that the Netherlands every year since to
the United States

424
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,120
to pay for such licenses this is about
one percent of our gross national

425
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,030
product

426
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,830
we are very small country of 16 million
people so this is one percent

427
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,280
request national products we sense to
the US to pay for software licenses

428
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,760
this represents between 50 and 100
thousands

429
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,129
jobs that we don't have in the
Netherlands and we strive to be a

430
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,080
knowledge economy and I take everything

431
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,189
because the way we do software and
muscle disorder of course

432
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,980
is you know not super special sings it's
it's it's

433
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:11,010
you know plain vanilla generic things
like like operating systems and word

434
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,330
processors in

435
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:16,530
you know simple databases for for for
low-end website stuff like that

436
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,710
on so this can be done you know
differently

437
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,540
so any call weeks minister is not
interested in suspect

438
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,090
but he's interested in creating on a
thousand jobs while keeping IT budgets

439
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:30,309
constant that's a good story

440
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:34,889
so this is a man another thing image are
used to explain Owen open stands as is

441
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,179
common language

442
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,490
you know if you want to do complex
project you need to have a common

443
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,710
language to exchange information

444
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,620
and a score six thousand years ago it
was big building projects

445
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,539
somewhere in the area were battered is
now probably and M

446
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:52,840
the you know somebody decided that the
Year Edition finished projects and so

447
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,070
you've made your day

448
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,610
couldn't I'm century morn sings in open
and so did project

449
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,789
failed so having a common language open
data standards

450
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:04,110
to exchange information is central

451
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:07,590
now an example of an open standard is
not this book but it's the blue boxes on

452
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,399
top it's a shipping containers

453
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,340
shipping container you can think of a
sort of an open standard you can use it

454
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,280
to pack serious things when would be to
transfer data center anything else

455
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,059
you can stick it on various modes of
transportation but it's the container

456
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:24,470
net is a universal standard and nobody
owns the specs to the complainant

457
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,520
to the best of my knowledge anyway and
this allow us to be.

458
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,059
allows to be very flexible in global
transport because by packing

459
00:24:32,059 --> 00:24:35,250
no filling the container doesn't have to
know what kinds of

460
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:38,650
transport message are being used and
people

461
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,760
transponder container don't care about
the contents so it's becomes very

462
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,850
flexible

463
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:46,919
a flexible system and if with logistics
experts say that was outstanding last

464
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,880
container shipping modern globalization
probably would not be possible

465
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,120
and this is sort of how the internet
works too we have all the services this

466
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,530
is the stuff that the Internet does for
us

467
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,510
be email or web browsing a voice over IP
or a hundred other services

468
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,390
we have all these devices that serve you
know allow us to to actually interact

469
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,220
but it's the the layer in the middle the
open standards that's where the action

470
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,559
happens

471
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:12,399
and as long as the standards are open
and everybody can use them then we can

472
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,080
have

473
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,039
billions of computers made by thousands
of different vendors

474
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,400
all interacting with each other and so

475
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,460
the middle layer of open standards and
this is just a few of course

476
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,150
is where two successive the Internet is
cynicism basically IT Architect for

477
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:28,840
beginner

478
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,570
services that some politicians are
always talking about what to do for you

479
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:35,939
and a device and software is want to
check on it and take people to talk

480
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,650
about

481
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,299
GOP Senate in the middle that actually
make it happen so that's

482
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,520
should be you know a part of the after
policy today

483
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,730
now this is a quick primer on what
source code is

484
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,490
and you know well it's good to have the
source code as well as a binary

485
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:55,730
you can actually study what machine duce
and in the example for instance of

486
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,970
from typing system of course it's nice
if you're suffering nation

487
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:02,640
that you're not being tapped by another
nation but that you are yourself

488
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,030
you know gas control of the system's

489
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,210
notices them what happens in most
organizations today

490
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:15,230
um hardware a hundred-point technology
sex trade mart actually have many

491
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,559
companies that will shell you PC or
server and

492
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,230
know muscle loot most of them do
essentially the same at the same price

493
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,549
point in such a fairly

494
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,870
open well-functioning market but then
the trouble begins now we have

495
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:32,380
no operating systems platforms and leave
middle LA on application in prison all

496
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,840
tied together

497
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,610
so you know I just stuck in a a
SharePoint a internet and therefore

498
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,960
you need to have windows on the desktop
so you know it

499
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,460
from the interface down you a lot and
then of course the question becomes if

500
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,530
all these choices are made for you
instead of you being able to pick and

501
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,450
choose yourself

502
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,330
what tools you want to use for what
purpose then are you in control of your

503
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,230
IT strategy in there for you in control
of your primary process

504
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:00,549
if your primary process is mostly doing
things with information

505
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:03,870
governments don't make anything they
they push information around that's what

506
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,240
it's what they make my paper with black
ink

507
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,110
in every known in a bit I'll me as soon
as you have a bridge will be by

508
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,260
you know yet I V company to do the
actual billing the government just

509
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,750
write some debate information processing
is the core function

510
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,299
therefore you know this is a very bad
situation

511
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:25,330
now I've been making these said pictures
also since but late 2001

512
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,289
if you do nothing things will get worse
because the financial incentive for such

513
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,820
for companies is to let you down further
and further

514
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,470
because that's the way to make the most
money is very simple economic incentive

515
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,740
anybody can get it

516
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,169
so if you do nothing things will get
worse in I'm a DSM

517
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:43,580
the first version of this year picture
back in 2001

518
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,990
and of course when Vista came out that
was basically it you know built in DRM

519
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,070
goes all the way down to the hardware
not lecture documents

520
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,090
into a specific operating system which
is of course

521
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,520
untenable for any government to be in a
position

522
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,530
so what you strive for is to have pheno

523
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,590
distinguished layers in a technology
stack and to make sure your

524
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,890
you're in control whatever later special

525
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,210
sodium to basic first of three my
perspective tears

526
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,690
commodity stuff most of which is
available open-source if you do

527
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,520
a proper migration things like operating
systems are databases and things like

528
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,539
that

529
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,820
firm or word processor so all those
kinds all the stuff that everybody needs

530
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,158
to be

531
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,340
you know to run an organization and then
their special applications for instance

532
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,640
the city of Amsterdam where I live has a
in all software system

533
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,960
to manage their sewer infrastructure now
that is a one-off special

534
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,630
you know seeing because their zone only
one city not found that as a specific

535
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,280
problem

536
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,190
so they've course should be in control
that's just how I mean it would be

537
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,510
ridiculous if they had to

538
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,940
rebuy software that was made for them
for a fee

539
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,950
if they would have to remind us three
years so stay should be you know the

540
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,480
owner of the intellectual property

541
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,549
affects us to the source code and then
they can hire various parties to do

542
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,770
upgrade just do support or whatever

543
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,220
and again you can open market for
services and that way you will chain

544
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,030
control of writing strategy in a primary
process in which is of course

545
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:10,470
what you should be all about now one of
the things I learned

546
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,900
is that it may be easier to separate the
subjective open standards

547
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:18,659
first is open source open sanders is a
lot easier to explain to people

548
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:23,260
whites good then open source open
sources is done also because sometimes

549
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,408
there are certain functionalities that
governments need

550
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:29,070
that aren't yet available as open-source
software and there are those

551
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,389
functionality should get have to look
from but they're

552
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,659
there there and then you have to say
well okay don't use proprietary software

553
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:39,890
but please try to store the data comes
out that application in open for months

554
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,429
on end if you change can migrate away
from it

555
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:45,890
once open source tools become available
or if you just want to migrate to

556
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,620
to something else so it does not mean
society was a.m.

557
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,700
her founded last year and is a question
of research initiative the Free Software

558
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,840
Foundation

559
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,280
now open standards for easy

560
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,520
open source is harder I think about
important but sometimes

561
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,918
you may need to sort of pick your
battles any updog

562
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,690
opened up miss it. was found its last
year in the Netherlands and shit

563
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,370
it's a global group busy promoting open
open standards chiefly to open document

564
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,220
former

565
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:20,100
can we get more morton's I'm

566
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,299
so we got the place you moving we rented
over the summer last year

567
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:27,639
and M a it was announced

568
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,260
in September last year in immediately a
account a lobbying effort was started by

569
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,179
a bunch of other proprietary

570
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,700
company's chief in Microsoft and some
food starch his partners

571
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,809
we got phone calls from our contact at

572
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:44,428
economics ministry saying gee what's
going on here you know we got beat up

573
00:30:44,429 --> 00:30:46,370
half a dozen of these lobbyist free much

574
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:50,080
comes out downstairs which know what's
happening we've never seen it before

575
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,610
these levels of of lobbying this kind of
commitment of resources

576
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,659
so from on december twelfth there was a
final Parliament debate with emotion

577
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,990
with your weapons should be adopted or
not

578
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,220
we were hoping will be adopted so we
will be key ministers for

579
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,779
a briefing control them members of
parliament and foreign minister

580
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,490
and we added additional proposals so
that the debate in Parliament would not

581
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,950
be but the core of the policy

582
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:16,789
but would be about these additional
proposals with them for me we would you

583
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:18,200
wouldn't get but then

584
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:22,190
he deported which still got through that
listen to them and the strategy

585
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:26,059
and of course now we wait it's from we
watched up the to your stream from the

586
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:26,870
parliament's

587
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,490
on a laptop switch on the lawn Windows
machine takes a in a bit of doing but

588
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,520
it's possible

589
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,929
I'm and then basically we listened in
amazement as members of parliament and

590
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:36,840
mister work

591
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,760
reading our emails to each other that
was very cool

592
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,340
Sony a proposal was a hope we know
proposal was a Baptist

593
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,330
I am and these are the the goals

594
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:54,129
um because it is me the government says
we want reform unity in the all public

595
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,760
sector

596
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,299
technology so not all the new government
departments and other

597
00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:01,150
schools and hospitals in all those
things that a non-commercial entities

598
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,909
nuns

599
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:05,549
we want them to work together and to
share data and it to be easy to share

600
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:05,990
data

601
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,159
this is the primary goal now so caught
up that is we want to be less dependent

602
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:11,539
on specific vendors we want

603
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:14,970
to choose you know we deal with in who
we give money to

604
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,210
to provide us with tools are services
and of course

605
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,929
know if ur spending all these billions
and billions every year we might as well

606
00:32:20,929 --> 00:32:22,100
make sure that it

607
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:26,080
no ends up in our own economy as much as
possible so that said a circle

608
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,299
so this is in essence the whole seeing
um

609
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:33,000
and book did you just saw I'm previous

610
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,029
I'm that eventually link this share from
our

611
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:40,010
from a website and no policy document
has been translated in english

612
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,120
with the express intent that no other
people in other countries can basically

613
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
use it

614
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,159
and have some benefit from it so you can
download that has a PDF booklet

615
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,390
and not have a go now some other facts

616
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,130
um OpenDocument format is no mandatory
in that state

617
00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,140
government I'm internal use will be
mandatory at the end up for next year

618
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,640
sold enough to read it then they have to
start using it next year

619
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,960
resident public sector so that means
things like local governments 12 months

620
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,679
later

621
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,010
so next year on January 2nd I can
actually send a letter of protest to my

622
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,789
local

623
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:15,820
government protesting the love left
access on

624
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,480
you know my house or something and I can
send that in OpenDocument format

625
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,840
and if they do not reply within 30 days
my protest

626
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,480
if it's you know proper format it's post
and so I can say look at

627
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,830
no I didn't I don't think you guys did a
very good job thing just reach I'm not

628
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,380
gonna pay my local tax

629
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,850
if they don't response so if they can
read the OpenDocument format

630
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:38,000
then you know my protest answer them to
pay tax so

631
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,150
they're a bunch people now we're gonna
have some fun on january second was that

632
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,179
because not everybody forces many I'm

633
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:48,320
now we ask for a few other things like a
study several hundred surprising

634
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,168
and we asked the question and just our
society to investigate best the lecture

635
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:53,100
from market

636
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:56,400
divergences our society has said that
they see

637
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,309
no indications that there are problems
with the show from market

638
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:03,840
which is interesting giving that
European antitrust Commissioner just

639
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,669
gave them

640
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:09,300
Microsoft I am it you points something
billion dollar

641
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,849
fine which is the highest every test
review

642
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:16,240
term now some bullshit stories have been
spreading around some fun

643
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,429
have been turning round about the plan
it makes open source manager which is

644
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:20,230
not true

645
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,580
it's just you have to show did you need
to pride yourself to rate you spend

646
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,339
money in proprietary software

647
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:27,980
you need to show that there is an open
source alternative so you have to show

648
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,070
you think about it

649
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,419
but if you can show you need brighter
such a Russian transient that's

650
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,699
absolutely fine

651
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,589
it for been specific product absolutely
not true on you can use you know any

652
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:38,570
product you want

653
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,270
as long as you start your government
opened up man from up with mine if you

654
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,480
want to use biko

655
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,820
the word processing that's fine if you
want to do you spend too much

656
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:49,099
takes to store your data you know that's
fine too just

657
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:52,409
you have to use open standards as well
know if you want to use additional

658
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,500
standards

659
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,390
that's absolutely fine now one of them

660
00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,799
big successes we've already had is that
OpenDocument format is now a mandatory

661
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:06,330
NATO standard this is a direct
consequence of this is such a policy

662
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,009
plan

663
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,089
because some people at the Dutch
Ministry of Defence basically not going

664
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:12,630
with it and say okay we need to start
supporting RDF

665
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,369
and then he said well we can only do
that if you make it a nature center so

666
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:17,260
they started talking to other NATO
partners

667
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,380
and everybody was white on positive
about it so open document format is no

668
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,730
actually a mandatory

669
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,849
Nature Center non-nato countries have to
start supporting it as a next year

670
00:35:26,849 --> 00:35:29,859
so this is one of her first really big
a.m.

671
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:33,369
you know concrete past successes in
terms of implementation

672
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:36,830
free call just got this in a few days
now of course

673
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,500
many organizations like the cerebellum
fighting back

674
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,530
was massive resources and this is a
group firm

675
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:48,540
so for trust of work it's a part of a
comp TIAA

676
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,770
a which is basically a lobby
organization for a bunch of a

677
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,259
bunch of largest providers of the
company's and they are saying

678
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,970
well we are in favor of choice to
because the government should be free to

679
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,849
chase

680
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:03,580
how to choose the business model you
know the the companies in the business

681
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,740
model they have tuned

682
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,240
but the sufferings from so that's
another kind of choice so

683
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,440
what they think is a central issue is
too busy my love defender

684
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,770
not the freedom of choice of the people
know whose taxes are buying software

685
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,060
but that serve the way to doing it now
decision any clues

686
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,210
Dutch former minister and former head of
a

687
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,320
nato University and he used to be
personal friend of Bill Gates actually

688
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,339
but she ended my shift a record fine
last year

689
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:34,460
we ship you know paid in for of a center
stop for quite some years actually

690
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,250
something you wanna 1.6 billion euros
which is

691
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,010
like two-point five billion dollars I
think right now

692
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:45,660
so it's a quite a significant chance
chunk of money and she recently stated

693
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,799
in the hell Tribune among other places
that she thinks that using open

694
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,619
standards is just a no brainer

695
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:54,240
it's just a smart business decision so
when people at this sort of government

696
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,500
level saying it

697
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,820
there's a real real change coming

698
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,130
only if you want to change in other
places because I'd love you know from

699
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,720
other countries have this people need to
step up

700
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,180
you need to do something in to lead the
charge because there are massive

701
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,640
interest in preventing this changing
slowly changed I'm

702
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,129
so if people don't lead the charge
become active nothing happens

703
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,200
because in on the other side there are a
lot of well-paid lobbyists and then

704
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,750
people finance to make sure this change
does not happen because

705
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,099
a lot of money is being made by a lot of
people from

706
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:30,359
you know your taxes amongst other things
so am

707
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:33,890
you need to do something because arrests
things go wrong and it's like any other

708
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,250
civil liberty you know

709
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,500
use it or lose it it's that simple if
you think it's bad that you can access

710
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,820
government website was

711
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,080
you know and non specific browser if you
don't

712
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,650
if you're not active about it seems will
get worse

713
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,710
now when you do this you will be called
an extremist

714
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:55,109
I've been called an extremist an idea
lets in a lot of trouble swear words

715
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,890
I'm France's when you see and multiple
convicted monopolist

716
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:02,848
is a multiple convicted monopolist he
will be called extremists but

717
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:05,680
that again all these people were in
college she missed at one time or

718
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,390
another

719
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,569
as you know this guy was branded a
terrorist in his days of course is so

720
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:11,660
was gone the in

721
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:17,118
Nelson Mandela was just plus taken off
to the no-fly list actually last month's

722
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,869
because he was a member of the ANC in
that man is a terrorist organization

723
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:24,970
so you know maybe you can be in good
company if you call that

724
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,060
but gun he was right it takes two
minutes time and

725
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,950
it for should be ignored and a lot of
stuff then you'll be fought or

726
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:36,609
am you'll know try to buy of I'm so
initiatives in the third phase that you

727
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:39,109
know that you're getting somewhere
basically these people start

728
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,880
actively fighting you know hiring
lobbyists or if they start offering you

729
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,660
money to each stop talking to these
people in Parliament then you know

730
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,819
you're really getting somewhere and then
of course

731
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,380
ff2 boss to say no to money firm

732
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,550
they offer me some at some point but you
know the price in my soul was a bit

733
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,930
higher than that so I

734
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,009
I sanctum and then you win

735
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,089
and then score shifted you know guns the
implementation and you're still talking

736
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,380
to government people

737
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,369
and German and they will explain to you
how difficult it is why it can't be done

738
00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:10,550
wide so large to use any other word
processor than the one

739
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,960
have been using for twenty years from
and

740
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,640
is very nice story about an opponent who
was an running along with his two

741
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,940
generals in the South of France it was a
hot

742
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,099
summer day some shining endorses we're
doing all the work but everybody is

743
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:25,839
sweating in a woman uniforms

744
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,259
an opponent and had no idea he said look
we need to plant trees in all the roles

745
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,190
in France

746
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:35,030
industries will grow they will provide
shadow no troops can march in a shadow

747
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,170
towards the battlefield and they'll be
much better

748
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:40,320
when you get to the battlefield he said
it was a brilliant a

749
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,430
and causal generals you know didn't
wanna

750
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:47,390
you'd be put to work as garnish so they
all started spreading these excuses

751
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:50,650
why it wouldn't work and couldn't be
done in the first the most senior

752
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:51,730
general said well

753
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:55,400
you mister bonaparte you do realize that
if we

754
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,070
plant these trees then it will take 20
years for them to grow large enough

755
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,450
to provide to shake that you're talking
about in Napoleon said of course I

756
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:06,810
understand it's only this is why I want
you to stop London tonight

757
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:10,950
and the point is a problem is very big
and we are expecting the IT

758
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:14,579
infrastructure of a national government
is a very big thing it takes a decade at

759
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,180
least

760
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,890
possibly more but that should never be
an excuse not two starts

761
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,460
because you know what the problem is not
gonna get smaller when you

762
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,839
you hold off on getting started with a
solution

763
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,040
so this is what I always use so we hold
these truths to be self-evident still

764
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,470
uses are created equal

765
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,470
the Dr now back to you certain
unalienable rights

766
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,800
that among these are life liberty the
pursuit of contents and that the

767
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:41,180
Securities Rochester is distributed
among users to run its powers

768
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,520
from their conscience know whenever any
form of software

769
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,950
becomes destructive Tunisians it is the
right of the users to alter or abolish

770
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,560
it

771
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,900
and use your new software laying its
foundation on such principles and

772
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:52,740
organizing

773
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,410
its powers in such form asked for them
shall seem most likely to their safety

774
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,940
and happiness

775
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,560
you can sort of see you know with a few
minor edits because I just did a search

776
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,180
and replace into worship

777
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,848
that one of your policy documents really
works also finished pop

778
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:10,880
so I think it's an it's a good way of
looking at it

779
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,940
so I am I think publish a journal

780
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,890
um I'm gonna press a button on my see a
message shortly and the slides and some

781
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:20,368
other stuff for the abuse to wear your
else

782
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:23,410
and if anybody wants to and get to work
um

783
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,720
please do and if their questions you can
hear ask them a

784
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,710
now we still have been assigned and I'm
gonna be here until Monday morning so

785
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:37,710
you know look me up person minimal
whatever thank you for your attention

786
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,570
sure

787
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,940
I can see you get lighter quite intense
so

788
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,670
step up to the mic in a way for
something then I can know so what

789
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,520
general direction any to look at yeah go

790
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,259
arm I was wondering if you could discuss
a little bit sum up the

791
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:04,140
arguments used by the Microsoft
lobbyists towards the members at the

792
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:04,868
Dutch government

793
00:42:04,869 --> 00:42:08,880
and their reactions to those arguments
hmm arm

794
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,990
and I'm specifically wondering the seams
at least here in the states that

795
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:16,530
nom and their little bit more

796
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,630
%uh accepting of those arguments and I
was wondering how

797
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,910
how much acceptance they gained within
your government

798
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:26,950
and what you might do to right right
well the reason more one of the reasons

799
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:27,880
and when we got there

800
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,410
the initial motion back in 2002 accepted
was that

801
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:36,149
that morning all over the front page of
all the major Dutch newspapers

802
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,619
well as the the Securities Exchange
Commission investigation into profit

803
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:40,980
margins of Microsoft

804
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,619
through division and so it's basically
stated that ended the net profit margins

805
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:46,190
on

806
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,270
Windows and Office operate here office
products

807
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:53,599
where about 90 percent so that was so
that was the thing

808
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,609
um I remember very clearly that in 2003
two pages on June 2003

809
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:01,759
when you were critical of particularly

810
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,650
US of the company's he would be branded
anti-american

811
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,420
and in the Netherlands in 2002 that was
a very bad thing

812
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,980
now six years later it's not such a bad
thing anymore

813
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,349
um basically Katrina was should have the
breaking point

814
00:43:17,349 --> 00:43:20,359
arm for judge people seeing that the
american government couldn't

815
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:24,060
you know the proper dikes to protect
people was quite harrowing

816
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,328
so since then actually you know being
anti-american is not more anymore and

817
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:29,070
political disclaimer now

818
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,119
you can just be openly critical um

819
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:35,619
shy thing that has certainly had to
change to change the perspective

820
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:40,420
makeshift has been arguing the day
basically have the god-given rights to

821
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,570
pursue their business model and that the
government is obliged to facilitate that

822
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,109
business model

823
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:50,569
hand again five years ago we were quite
successfully arguing that now

824
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,790
mostly naked left out of after room

825
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:57,270
that that just doesn't hold much water
anymore but they keep trying and they

826
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,349
have a very professional lobby
organisation

827
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:02,359
they spend about $500 million euros per
year in Europe

828
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:06,700
on lobbying our budget is a 0

829
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,190
so the fact that we're still making some
gains assisted

830
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:17,190
I think shows the strength of the Indian

831
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:21,060
its yet when you see the spending all
this money in lobbying

832
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,339
um I mean are they giving link in the US
direct campaign contributions and

833
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:28,849
works moons that seems like the someone
insurmountable

834
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:32,680
think when you go to partitioning you
say alright this is a good idea

835
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,720
thanks yeah it's nice and then gets
10,000 archer

836
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,800
for Microsoft whatever's campaign that
seems to be somewhat

837
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,839
we've never at some I I'm very happy to
say in a Dutch

838
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,578
campaign financing and its political
structure looks very differently

839
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:51,630
I am but we think we've never had been
able to prove a direct

840
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,230
flow of money or said if resources

841
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,740
from Microsoft to leave yet just
political parties

842
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,750
but he has been very interesting to see
that

843
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,700
departing political central the
Netherlands that the one that's always

844
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,869
in power the Christian Democrats

845
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:11,180
I'm never have an opinion on this matter
weather at the National

846
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:14,589
level or any local the government levels
there of

847
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:20,020
um so it may be that they don't get cash
but maybe they get to know a bunch over

848
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:23,560
planes and messaging election time to do
transport or something like that

849
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:30,339
but we've never been able to prove that

850
00:45:30,339 --> 00:45:34,570
for sidelight say Justin great so
inspiring to hear

851
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,540
that one human being planting the seed
effect so much change I think it's

852
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,230
really great

853
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:42,990
yeah um but what i'd like to ask about
the nato

854
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,150
announcement that just came in the is
and what that means a I'm

855
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:49,520
other deadlines and what does that
affect

856
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,349
and really interesting as I understood
it but I only got the mail basically

857
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:55,109
when I was already in the US I hadn't
been

858
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:59,150
in in touch with my terms context the
Dutch Ministry defense

859
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:02,320
firm as I understand it the

860
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,050
they move towards a situation where all
nato organizations

861
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,910
have to be able to reach and rights to
open document formats

862
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:13,170
am when other parties requested from
them

863
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,280
%uh in in terms of you know moving
documents around

864
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,839
and the older a Mike some binary form
must have now been discontinued

865
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:25,060
so the only binary format for documents
that is still allowed his to

866
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:29,450
2003 version of Microsoft Office and
then opened up man from it will be

867
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,300
become the standard basically and so you
can still you continue to use any

868
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,599
word processor that you like but it has
to be able to communicating government

869
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:38,089
from out

870
00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:41,450
which includes Michael product so it's
no problem there

871
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,089
I'm but of course realistically just
take it will take several years to

872
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:46,279
implement

873
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:50,070
Herman that's fine but it's good to sort
of you know set up a goal and work

874
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:50,859
towards it

875
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:56,319
some very happy with this announcement
because it's a global thing

876
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,839
what would you recommend that a.m.

877
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:03,880
and 90 employees for the government do
to encourage open standards

878
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,240
fees I know other stuff that you don't
know that you're going if I tried that

879
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,540
in my jam

880
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,660
how better to have very quickly yes I'd
be up against all the

881
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,868
and ministers have already invested yeah
these proprietary software in

882
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:20,130
but yeah what what we've seen in the
Netherlands is that there were many IT

883
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,240
professionals in government who actually
wanted the same things that we wanted

884
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,319
but they kept bumping up against his
glass ceiling

885
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:30,569
um and debating as soon as you get this
policy moving

886
00:47:30,569 --> 00:47:34,460
then you'll see all the people who will
in a starchy do it for you come out of

887
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,780
the woodwork basically

888
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,000
because big day want this to you know
I'm there many IT professionals in

889
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,599
government wanted section things

890
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:43,980
for the section reasons or maybe for
other reasons

891
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:48,190
um so I think the best thing you can do
is an employee with inside knowledge

892
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,829
is to help whatever outside groups there
are in the same way did we got a lot of

893
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:53,790
help in love

894
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:57,140
critical information from people on the
inside

895
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,109
you know they would basically you know
go home and M

896
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:04,250
a you know mail something and/or

897
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:07,829
no make a phone call to us and say ok im
gonna be in this bar

898
00:48:07,829 --> 00:48:12,089
at that point and I might be I might be
up for getting a USB stick

899
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:16,060
when I leave that might happen and then
you know we would go there and

900
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:19,390
lo and behold there will be a little USB
stick with you know documents about the

901
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,009
procurement process or something like
that

902
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,319
this is how you get your information now
you might be risky enjoy doing that

903
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,829
actually so it's

904
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:29,970
it's a personal choice not gonna ask
anyone to reach the job but

905
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:35,089
the the most effective part you can play
is to help the group on the outside

906
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:38,490
was accurate information with
time-critical information so they can

907
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,250
not be more effectively and then once
you get a policy in place then you can

908
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:46,970
again be divinely inside were actually
implemented but then you have a mandate

909
00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:50,069
so I think that that would be a role but
you have to you know make your own

910
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:51,060
decisions

911
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,589
how how much risk you wanna take was a
because it can be risking you can lose

912
00:48:54,589 --> 00:48:55,490
your job in

913
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:58,890
some people nearly did in the
Netherlands cell

914
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:05,890
so be careful

915
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,670
sorry missed beginning this speech you
covered this but

916
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,470
recently Microsoft got their standard

917
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:19,230
ISO certified for or look at its not
chestnut or so yes so if you could

918
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:22,860
P talk about then where we're going on
how they accomplish okay

919
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:26,500
I'm not an expert on the process but in
the following to know some people in

920
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,380
earnings who are experts on a process

921
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,500
from yes they got it through the
procedure

922
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:36,170
in the process they basically destroyed
I so um

923
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,280
I so is now dead in the water because
Microsoft has stuff

924
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,070
all the committees with a business
partners and with countries like Ghana

925
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:43,720
who

926
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,960
you know get fentanyl XML in the never
vote again on anything

927
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,660
so now we have from understand it
proposals from anything from

928
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,569
should you call a gloves to water
filtering systems

929
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:58,970
that are basically not progressing
through the process

930
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:02,720
because all these parties that you know
good brought into I so to vote in

931
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,560
election L

932
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:07,529
and not showing up for defense and other
issues so much of this as

933
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,690
literally in an this is has been told to
me by various experts

934
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:15,070
including I some people from geneva
basically in the process of getting

935
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:15,570
there

936
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:19,380
standard folding boat pushed through I
so they basically destroy the ice a

937
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,160
process

938
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,740
and that's gonna cost human lives
especially because now we don't get that

939
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,500
standard some

940
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,700
water filters so you know what is the UN
going to buy two

941
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:31,510
help people in Africa to get good water
filtration system this is a real world

942
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,080
problems is going to cost lives

943
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,600
um and so on several countries a

944
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,310
in Brazil China India Iran and there are
like six or seven others have filed

945
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,450
formal complaints

946
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:45,450
and various organizations in European
countries

947
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,770
have filed formal complaints against the
way to process was handled because there

948
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,200
was

949
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,410
fairly outright corruption going on and
it's all been

950
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:56,750
painstakingly mean grow call has a very
detailed documentation on all process in

951
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:00,300
and Pamela Jones is a much more of an
expert in Uzbekistan I am

952
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,170
so I go there in that should have read
up on all the details

953
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:09,820
I'm when and I should decision was made
to Dutch government immediately declared

954
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:10,530
they've made like

955
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:14,910
within an hour they had a press release
in SS this does not affect our decision

956
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,319
to support ATF as year only

957
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,580
future documents that in the Dutch
government so I was like

958
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:27,190
immediate press release I'm in the same
bus from Belgium Norway Germany's moving

959
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:28,030
that way

960
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:31,790
I'm not talking to members of a bitch
parliament's we've had discussions in

961
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:32,650
Berlin

962
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:37,150

and there's a Spanish province which

963
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:41,550
already has Tony migrate its to open
source software for all its functioning

964
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:45,110
including things like my breeze in
school and everything um so

965
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,770
in Europe should leader something going
on and of course there's a little

966
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,450
something

967
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:52,310
so yes might make some I have succeeded
in

968
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:56,020
something but idk it means nothing
because people have already chosen on

969
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:56,580
