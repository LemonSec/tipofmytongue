1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,249
and well that's how we look like

2
00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:06,890
we thought that's mean little nicer

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,980
black-and-white sketchy pictures of our
faces

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:13,940
let's try if the laser pointer is
working closely the point is a really

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,379
important

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,610

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,810

9
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,680

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,860

the hearts

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,620
of Europe and what could describe
Austrian hackers and gets better than

strange sherman-like pronunciation thing

16
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
going on the street accent that's
because Mike

native language is German are actually
Austrian German and Austrian German is a

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:00:59,930
standard

19
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,828
variety of German and a member of our
group gunther

20
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,409

present you first the fall

32
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,310
we started in 1993 a long time ago and
we started as a fanzine

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:58,409
in the meantime the fencing is more that
is your book it's five front pages thick

34
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,259
and so we're still collecting cool
important information

35
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,719
I think it's compatible to the user
interface of

36
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,009
I don't ever turn on if you remember
iran says it turned out okay

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,060
so onerous till collecting suffered a
new issue

38
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,079
it will be deemed in the wonderful
english-language the lingua franca of

39
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,329
modern capitalism

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,900
we also collects I know I go back to
office spaces in cubicles

64
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,200
we collect office I so what's office i'd
office arts a

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,870
plight of the site is the stuff that you
do when you're bored in your office you

66
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,010
start to scribble around in your paper
and you make drawings

67
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,739
and we collect those drawings because we
think that's a really really important

68
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:05,370
art

69
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,939
of late capitalism people aboard an
office cubicles

70
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,349
and they produce art and might most
famous

71
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:19,349
piece of applied office art is this one
I think that's almost humorous I guess

72
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,889
I food so

73
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,460
we created the Great Firewall of China
the Google campus

74
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,030
you see it's really bad it's a big match
stitch

75
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,860
and chinese heads and so it's really
really bad installation but meant to get

76
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,819
the point around like across for

77
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,430
North Americans you know yet to get its
a

78
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,210
so speeches new low key political
statement that's

79
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,948
whatever didn't Acer us and we didn't
know why we could actually set up the

80
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:48,620
crap there

81
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,419
and it didn't bother us there was
security around and it didn't like t0 so

82
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:56,280
arrest us whatever and I found out
because and we didn't know that

83
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,580
it was the day of the big shareholder
meeting

84
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,020
hadn't won in tibet Press and that
somehow

85
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,039
rescued us %ah we did the first

86
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:10,568
overhead cumshots in the history of
mankind's

87
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:14,940
because you know overhead projector is a
dying medium and the only way to start

88
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,960
to really I don't like to thank her

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,789
yes to improve it's pornographic
possibilities in

90
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:25,030
you can find that on youporn we have a
3.84

91
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,599
rating out of five not bet sign of

92
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,810
there are people out there with strange
fetishes you know if

93
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,000
okay with it a a computer game where we
build still doing a trilogy of computer

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,360
games called soviet

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,250
that super stuff you might not know that
but there's the last existing

96
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,930
Soviet republic is within the borders of
Austria it's like shaken out a border

97
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,759
and up with of its a good we to take

98
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,919
a completely obsolete for of computer
gaming the adventure game

99
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,590
and mix it up with this interesting
still existing

100
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,490
still in this country and it's out there
you can download its

101
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,120
for all different platforms and of
course

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,960
plates recreates the firsts a

103
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,930
must a massive multiplayer some
bristling

104
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,740
and if you're we have a couple of like
no one else structure doesn't network

105
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,789
topologies token ring network stuff like
that

106
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,710
so if you're into thumb wrestling with
five hundred other people

107
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,240
we could do that's Maurice anyone
interested in

108
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,169
doing message monthly a sundress 21 all

109
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:35,479
all perfect I think

110
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,219
we should meet tomorrow let's say let's
say 5 o'clock

111
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,229
in the hallway okay if you're interested
ok maybe 6 whatever

112
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:47,690
will do it up we together with a group
called shifts

113
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,030
in the end up a are doing right mix of
the cut and run exotica

114
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,919
is the first and therefore leading
festival concerned with cock the

115
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,330
robotics

116
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,270
so if you want to create robots that
makes cocktail serve cock this think of

117
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,349
this has sparked conversations to use a
drink

118
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:06,340
%uh at or a light cigarettes or smoke
cigarettes

119
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,960
you should come to be another extension
should apply to try to fly over to the

120
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,669
end the cost Austin government is paying
for it

121
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:19,169
a so sometimes we make small appearances
of Rome exotica robots in San Francisco

122
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,840
but

123
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,310
if you like that I mean that's what
media art should be all that the

124
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,629
I mean most of the time that we got
festivals you hear is

125
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:30,740
you for your interest in Cox and then to
get drunk

126
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,379
at protech sought to cut you can can get
drunk all the time that's

127
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:40,759
really perfect we ferry people alive for
15 minutes if they wish to

128
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,360
it's for americans the Americans like
experience this dining experiences

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,509
whatever experiences this new
experiences

130
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,870
and we have the experience to experience

131
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,800
be at of premature burial so

132
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,949
if will do that again it's really really

133
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,430
cool for goth kids but they are always
checking out

134
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,020
we never ever heard a single got kids
date taken out

135
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,469
don't know wife a we're doing arse

136
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:14,500
electronico costs electronica in San
Francisco next time in September it's

137
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,009
the

138
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:18,370
festival for a sex and technology and
the next

139
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,620
topic the next theme will be sex in
science fiction

140
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,620
so if you're in through sex and science
fiction if you want to create fucking

141
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,800
machines like this piece here

142

or tell a dildo Nick devices or a
guesstimate ron's

143
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,180
you should send us an email that's
actually fuck silver

144
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,380
and fix it was traded by the guy who
created 25

145
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,220
that's why it looks like 25 just like
Johnny Five

146
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,860
got older I guess ESA lookin chain saw

149
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:59,490
he doesn't know Austria Austria

150
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,790
the like most of the Austrians are very
comfortable with you see

151
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,349

177
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,200

183
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,750
an actual in fact that happens up like

184
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,510

matsu love or something else I don't

186
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,930
so a and that's what I wanna talk to you

187
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,030
today I want to talk about corporate
culture

188
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,610
and how it works and especially about

189
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,320
the motivation though infrastructure I

the South please let's

199
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,380
make it happen

200
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,670
year star

201
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,280
near lewke I he pooped

204
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,740
you would help in I don't know but I
know how we can find own

205
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,100
at school together robo buoy the Google
says new economy and neoliberalism

206
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,540
emerged nets what's troubling you did

207
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,469
what is then new economy in your
liberalism denote a new relationship

208
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,490
between the employer and the employee

209
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:48,010
before the week on me lever was conceded
that was ever since classic capitalism

210
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,380
the eighteenth-century you mean no

211
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,160
capitalism a production includes one
that creates wealth

212
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,750
exclusively to the production and sale
look forward objects

213
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,140
yes the typical worker can be found in
approval capitalist factory

214
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,810
and his work is defined by the plant he
sells his manpower

215
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,970
and is therefore the direct opposite the
factory owner

216
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:13,960
was the buyer the workers labor didn't
miss too cold war

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,020
scold is called roast your intake Newsom
you opposing entities a worker in Calpe

218
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,010
moons yes boo the trip the new economy
now

219
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,740
is to make the workers believe that
their owners to of course this is not

220
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,360
true

221
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,640
because they're still without executive
power however

222
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,210
there's a shift control away from the
bosses whose job it was to monitor and

223
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,840
motivate workers

224
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,050
control is shifted to the workers
themselves were tricked into thinking

225
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,840
that they're

226
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,240
interest %uh the same is the capitalist
masters this change called

227
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,790
the shift from a disciplinary society
towards the Society of control me

228
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,760
both what does that mean Kiki good
question

229
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,510
that s cool again disciplinary societies
managed to keep its subordinates where

230
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,130
they are by

231
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,640
implementing control in punishment like
my mommy daddy with me tell me what to

232
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,960
do

233
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,430
yes or like your future corporate
overlords

234
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,960
but control and punishment can stay for
an individual's

235
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,930
in resistance and there are always ways
of avoiding if not hacking

236
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,420
these mechanisms of control Lakewood
make long trips to the toilet

237
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,310
theft what material sick leaves
pretending to look busy

238
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:30,090
plane dumb so would changed with new
economy

239
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:34,340
and yield turns into a model for society
as a whole lotta

240
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,490
energy access old-line

241
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,910
polls on not again

242
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,089

is stalled you keep me

248
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:08,500
let us see ourselves his workers if only
to remember who really controls the

249
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,750
means of production

250
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,700
that is true Kiki I will call until my

goldberg to the presentation it worked

258
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,430
on

259
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:49,570
we had to find out how we could make a
really good public showing of course

260
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:53,040
or only already published something
about this

261
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,620
Tim or early I like em um

262
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,760
self good

263
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,270
we actually have like two more episodes
out there so if you're into marxist sock

264
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,020
puppet to check out

265
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,449
a two more episodes of chicken boo boo

266
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:14,680
and as you have %uh noticed I guess a
monochrome be leftists so

267
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,610
we're not going to knock the capsule is
the No into libertarian is we've got

268
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,250
into liberalism okay

269
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,820
liberalism is a cool shower tell you
okay so I am

270
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,300
so we are leftists and thats up

271
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,410
of course have left this perspective um

272
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,089
kickin boo boo told you about shift from
the discipline is aside it towards

273
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,450
Society of control so in shorts

274
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,840
like an abstract could be okay

275
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,590
company or corporation you still have
different forms to control

276
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,830
people insights employees in the 19th
and early 20th century

277
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,320
and in the late twentieth century and
early 21st century

278
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,840
up in the beginning there was a clear
opposition between workers

279
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,040
and the capitalists and because of this
clear opposition something really really

280
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,370
interesting happens a whole culture

281
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,559
emerge the so-called workers culture the
SoCal labor culture

282
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,029
there are many many examples out there
how labor cultural workers cults worked

283
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:18,148
especially in the realm of culture

284
00:17:18,149 --> 00:17:22,720
3s also United States of America also it
was a hard hard and harsh

285
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,980
anti-union war going on in the early
20th century

286
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,129
it was lots of a interesting cool thing
going on

287
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:34,830
a workers clubs reading workers clubs
for reading workers clubs for singing

288
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,830
and get this really interesting a
culture of the work a song

289
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:43,019
so the people in various companies and
mills factories

290
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:46,629
rex lee work together and spending time
together

291
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:51,200
and the hat a general feeling for
solidarity

292
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,440
because then you would say there's
somebody somebody trying to fuck with us

293
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:54,980
okay

294
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,230
and we have to work together but now
with these

295
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,620
something really really interesting
happens now the dais

296
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,690
the solidarity at least that's what
corporations and companies try to do

297
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,009
solidarity should be shut off

298
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:14,870
at the borders of the corporation so
there shouldn't be any solidarity

299
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:15,750
between

300
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,429
workers of one corporation workers at
the other corporation

301
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:22,500
this would be a weapon classics your no
tunnel

302
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,580
nowadays works completely different
nowadays

303
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,029
its we against Anna

304
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,149
and because it's we against Bama its we

305
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:37,500
against everybody so because there's no
solidarity between

306
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,580
single workers in single companies all
over the planet

307
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,019
a the capital is actually try to trick
people into believing

308
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:50,230
at the half executive power or some kind
of power

309
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,100
so I mean if talk about the Google
campus thats exactly happening there

310
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,340
the people at the Google campus there
whirlpools they have free smoothie got

311
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,029
great steak step everything the

312
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:03,470
would think that that could that they
could wants to have

313
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:06,750
but they're not using the stuff you see
the picture because and I don't know a

314
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,559
single

315
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,158
guy working at Google whoever winds at
least five minutes to the stupid

316
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:12,870
whirlpool

317
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,480
because they just have the feeling of I
could go to the Whirlpool

318
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,940
I could go to my boss was actually my
friends and talk to them about

319
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,379
that I'm not feeling very comfortable
and because I have the feeling of

320
00:19:24,379 --> 00:19:27,789
I could do whatever I like I have to
freedom of choice

321
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,340
know what is actually trying to fight
for freedom and choice

322
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,230
I mean freedom is a stupid a thing to
talk about anyways because there's a

323
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,009
different

324
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,289
for most liberal three DOM and leftist
rearm and right-wing Freedom

325
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:45,049
what's freedom anyways I'm not talking
about freedom

326
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,899
but I'd like to show you a couple of
examples

327
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:52,080
a of how corporations

328
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,240
tried to moderates their employees

329
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,279
a corporation is more like a tribal this
text thing

330
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,340
it's more like a try there's two tribal
5 p.m. and is to try this Google

331
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,970
and there's the tribe of Intel ok
whatever else

332
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,509
and as long as the tribe's sticks
together

333
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:14,889
and works tooth to to make the tribe
stronger

334
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,529
%uh actually the employees have a good
feeling about steer

335
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:22,629
family their corporate family and its

336
00:20:22,629 --> 00:20:25,980
the capitalists have like you succeeded

337
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,370
in tricking employers and workers the
workers

338
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,799
into believing that if the workers are

339
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,299
exploiting themselves directionally

340
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,100
doing something good for themselves so
there's this

341
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,289
exploitation thing is completely twisted
know it it's

342
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,809
so aunt one of the mechanisms to try
that is

343
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,049
the family the corporate family we
against them

344
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:55,100
if like into doesn't survive I mean
we'll drown on the big big wild ocean of

345
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,850
capitalism so we have to make you have
to ruin our little boats we

346
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,379
we can do it's and its what else

347
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:06,549
could you do if you're sitting in a
boat's and need to money we the people

348
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:11,190
you need some pics and of course the
songs are not work to songs they're not

349
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,720
up but not songs they're not songs that
were created by

350
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,279
workers because the thought Haiti we
should work together and help each other

351
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,320
they are created by the corporations
themselves

352
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,178
and the songs a Colt corporate dance

353
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,360
and I'm collecting corporate anthems for
long long long time

354
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,820
up that could be a typical

355
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,509
employees in a typical North American
it. corporation

356
00:21:38,509 --> 00:21:43,279
and she seems so at least shady I would
see

357
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:48,659
yet doing stuff like that steer talk
about organizational structures sands

358
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,029
selection of strategies that people and
systems people in systems how

359
00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:57,070
wonderful in fact go look a little bit
like that guy if

360
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,620
and if you happy about it and

361
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,249
what does this guy feel happy nobody
really knows

362
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:10,299
%uh there's a shady capitalist and so

363
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:14,360
for I'd like to go back in history
little bit

364
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,460
because I pick the couple of different

365
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,539
corporate anthems from different time
periods

366
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,860
and I'd like to start with the really
typical anthem

367
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,070
from the late 1940s

368
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,090
it's there and them the

369
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,199
that the famed with the firm company him

370
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,159
of IBM back then

371
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,399
it was clearly a patriarchal thing

372
00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:47,299
going on at the idea it was a big guy
called who was the founder of IBM

373
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,350
tart HPV what's your teacher what's up

374
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,159
the song actually is singing about
teacher Watson but

375
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,940
it's not sing about teaching Watson
Senor teach what's a junior because he

376
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,289
was a junior of course

377
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:02,899
%uh it singing about this great guy
called

378
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:06,070
teacher watson's it's actually singing
about a whole

379
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,689
dynasty of what's okay and that we
should be proud

380
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,360
its s employees of IBM to work for
mister watson

381
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,570
and that week can go on we can go on
court

382
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,509
and make this corporation better and
picture and better

383
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:25,620
it's pretty clear the ASEAN about the
big box

384
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,600
it's a pretty a let's call it the pre

385
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,360
early capitalists a thing to sing about

386
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,539
the box okay covered anthems from the
80s don't sing about the boss

387
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,789
this thing about feeling goods about
being in the company

388
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,369
okay so I have to plug out so can you

389
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:49,419
okay after plugging into this wonderful

390
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,700
Colby CD player I hope the Kobe

391
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,549
CD player a works ants

392
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:00,399
police pay close attention in the
beginning the recording is not good

393
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,450
maybe you could

394
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,299
turned welcome on its from 1947 is
called

395
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:08,730
ever on works and it wasn't the only
song

396
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,619
IBM hats there was a whole IBM songbook

397
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:19,210
okay it again you can hear please turn
to page 5 page five in the songbook

398
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,249
blah blah blah blah blah it's almost
like a preacher

399
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:26,480
it in fact a little bit it reminds of

400
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,999
the protest and some book culture in
little bits

401
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,409
and thats pretty much working well
because

402
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:37,389
I mean because of the protest dance we
have capital is now

403
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:40,639

431
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,360
a I mean okay %uh

432
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,230
just one story about IBM you probably
heard about it already but I'm

433
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,270
any help telling a story they're singing
about

434
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,940
that to serve humanity has speed our aim

435
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:26,050
in the year 1947 to 1948 that's actually
a little bit

436
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,139
cynic a you probably heard about

437
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,940
the harder its punch cards up the other
response cards

438
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,150
were licensed by IBM IBM bought 200
company

439
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:40,310
and the license the punch cards to nazi
germany and actually

440
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:43,830
not Germany would have wouldn't have
been able to

441
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,419
a to the concentration camps to
administer that concentration camps

442
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,460
without punch cut systems so

443
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,090
if IBM sings about to serve humanity has
been our aim in 1947 to 1948

444
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,270
to three years after the war that's a
little bit

445
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,990
let's call it alt okay um

446
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:07,790
I'm not sure if anybody's hereof from
IBM but

447
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,830
I think they say don't wanna hear the
story that

448
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,629
they don't like it my girlfriend by the
way is working for IBM

449
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,679
okay so let's go

450
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,679
to a the next song I mean

451
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,490
you heard the song it's about teacher
what's this about

452
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,720
people Reaper scenting a company it's
about

453
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,250
we the workers and our boss

454
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,890
and we have to pretty much to what p
likes

455
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,900
so it's pretty clear is a pretty clear
hierarchy and there's a plea

456
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,600
pretty clear patriarchal a subtext

457
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,900
a in the song the next song is from the
1980s 10 you merely few difference

458
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:52,290
first of all the song is a cover version

459
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,520
it just replaced one works

460
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,900
in the song by a company name it's a
company

goods

511
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,440
%uh huh so you saw thats

512
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,480
a is a complete difference between his
nineteen forty song and this nineteen

513
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,200
eighties song

514
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,029
it costs are just just feel maybe a
little bit fair to Phillips I don't know

515
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:28,830
I'm is is this like dick a context where
it is a party and they made a song for

516
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,199
one-time use or something that you would
hear it depends it depends

517
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,230
some corporations actually happen for
pronounce them

518
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,340
and see the program corporate anthem in
the morning

519
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,340
the meat in small groups into some

520
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,809
some corporations especially after this
to say in japan it's

521
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:49,240
yeah but it happens in the States

522
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,340
it happens in Europe it happens
especially a couple of corporations

523
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,539
a have nice nice program Sams in the

524
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:02,370
scandinavia a nobody knows why doesn't
like good health sys than

525
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:07,419
almost let nobody knows I don't know so
it depends that's why I picked a couple

526
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:09,230
of different songs from different

527
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,279
contexts and settings a and want to
present for you

528
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,049
so the next song is from the Meadowlands
two

529
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:22,000
it's actually a a meta corporation it's
a corporation doing accounting for other

530
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,870
corporations

531
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,130
and thats KPMG 3 p.m. sure

532
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,830
whatever D pronounce it so let them jet

533
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,740
a is a

534
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,309
more like an Olympic anthem so you
really

535
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:43,490
lots of sports metaphors in the sock
it's about golden shining and winning

536
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,279
you'll see it's a little bit Bongo Bongo
it'll be like 80s kinda f no

537
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:51,710
so get into the bomb the motorcade own

you have to get into the groove should

568
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,830

569
00:35:58,830 --> 00:36:02,090
that that's an american stop

570

gift a okay so

572
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:12,670
one read my mind most-favored line in
the song is

573
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,850
identity one energy one strategy

574
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:22,960
same I mean that rips your heart out so
we're

575
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,250
I yeah

576
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:32,330
south-north Korean but is in fact such
good

577
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,140
of okay so

578
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,660
we have an ongoing miles true love songs
here at toward if

579
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,310
our site call its a so although it comes
across a little bit

580
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:49,090
updates its the KPMG song um

581
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:53,450
is it's like a costing shoelders song it
some sexually

582
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:56,720
to try a nice metaphor it sounds like

583
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,660
the the MSM other big gigante

584
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:05,140
Asian sports events played on a kitchen
review

585
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,250
okay that's my my feeling

586
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:11,710
I i get when thinking about KPMG and
some

587
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,830
poor people that keep him to you have to
sing that so it's the

588
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,819
let's go to the late capitalism as the
go for the gold of the fittest

589
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,290
the sport metaphor so Anna

590
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:28,900
and its because a already mentioned
theory of course

591
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,670
corporate anthems and even part of the
world

592
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,000
I would not go as far as Japan

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,100
but I 12 percent a song from India

594
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:43,450
okay the I guess not too many people
know Indian

595
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,590
companies or corporations especially not

596
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,730
this corporation I'm talking about now
cause I think it pretty much collapsed

597
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,750
a it sick corporation called MindTree

598
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,650
heard of its MindTree I think

599
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,020
they may still be around but not in the
setting of like this like

600
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,870
late 1990s and early 2000s when the song
was recorded

601
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:09,150
a and they pretty much I guess collapsed
and

602
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:13,970
went bankrupt whatever and then the
Houston a MindTree four different

603
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,060
corporation I don't know

604
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,320
but you'll see why because this
corporation tries to play

605
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,830
a that corporate shills social
responsibility cards

606
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,540
so it's almost like the Michael checks
the corporation the the pop Geldof

607
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:31,830
of corporations you'll you'll hear that
I mean up I mean you

608
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,910
you'll see the lyrics and you'll
understand why

609
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:38,549
that can't be from the Western cultural
backgrounds especially

610
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,710
I have to remind you please read

611
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,970
the first two lines after some okie

612

sweet you company

638
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,000
midway here we are already been

639
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
nowhere soupy at the failed affects of

640
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:48,510
top 20 top 20% of global companies but
we know we want to be

641
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:52,390
maybe I don't know any of

642
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,290
top

643
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:01,610
I remember you like this from from the
rooftop we knew we'd reach the sky II

644
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:05,160
and that something like

645
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,390
that's like like appears like Indian
speechless stick approach I guess I'm

646
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,620
not into like you know when stuff like
that but

647
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,410
it somewhat like in the special children
I mean it's probably not

648
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:18,750
the politically correct term to say dat
but the hats a

649
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,920
the picture of a spastic child's Esther

650
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,050
corporate local I mean

651
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,360
the summer-like over did certainly a

652
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,560
I mean special children this

653
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,509
its up there's lots of corporate drivel
in its lots of Haiti

654
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:40,310
really twenty times new revolution it's
almost like you know it

655
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,799
it's like Aquarius you know like it's
taken various revolution and they never

656
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,600
a region where the times and never
change lives I guess

657
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,520
so and it's almost LexA days ago would
call it selects

658
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,560
days ago a approach to corporate

659
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,690
anthems the next song a is

660
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,390
actually it's not a song it's a it's a
wrap and

661
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:10,129
fuhrman at it's rather and it's not the
gangsta rap know it's a financial

662
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,310
analyst rap

663
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,090
hood it's from the UK

664
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:22,090
it's one of the first corporate and some
stuff partner so

665
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,670
okay a lets your next song its by a

666
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:32,330
UK company the failed miserably so

667
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,890
the dikes to and tell wife

668
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:40,529
first the fall their corporate anthems
ironic never

669
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:43,720
ever if you start a corporation or if
you hire somebody

670
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,900
to ride the covert and some for your
cooperation never tell them to be ironic

671
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,230
if

672
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,410
take that some serious business here we
have to motivate people

673
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:55,370
and not like make fun about the company
okay if that doesn't work

674
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,390
okay a actually I think it's the first

675
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:01,900
is the first known a nurse cora

676
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:05,700
so north korea's really like a

677
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,880
let's hope they are many people listen
to north korea

678
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,620
and the like it goodness I guess maybe
1999 2000 I don't know

679
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,830
but it's definitely Nurse Corps it it's
a good song

680
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,580
its really badly maastricht so you
almost came here

681
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:23,750
like the work you're saying year but it
was ironic

682
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,700
and therefore trip company collapsed
probably and at least a British

683
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,630
a so let's try to hear this song

684
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,520
really important in the beginning you'll
hear all

685
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,200
desist the sound of two stock market
could

686
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,760

Street since the prices but I don't
provide

698
00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:28,789
digital signals went minds

699
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:31,969
Crestone good luck

702
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,140
to

703
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,410
solution dust bowl and Parker do
throughout

704
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:52,890
to hold

705
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:59,890
yeast

706
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:07,619
City used to analyze what's your address
on conditional heteroskedasticity

707
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:12,090
this

708
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,430
do

709
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,569
stopped Mike I tell

710
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:23,090
it goes on an arm on

711
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:27,860
first stops I can you believe that

712
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:33,390
I mean 0 I really like conditional
heteroskedasticity I'm

713
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:37,100
they're not fucking you'd really exist

714
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,500
actually huh market mutual means I'm not
in the business

715
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,190
what the fuck it's all school it's %uh
like a

716
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,280
this party about the medics it's almost
like a children's song a little bit but

717
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,050
in between

718
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:56,200
it's really really tough financial
analysts believe that seem ironic

719
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:00,140
okay on the fantastic city you're
talking about of course is the stock

720
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:00,759
market

721
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,410
so like if you have like a an everyday
rapture

722
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,049
he is singing about some rapping about
cock

723
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,890
not a Bronx or whatever their fucking
talking about the fantastic city of the

724
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:12,920
stock market

725
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:16,890
I think that's a really nasty place
really okay

726
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,759
I mean my favorite line is here all 9's
actually

727
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:25,360
its friction free cash flow moving money
from Tokyo to Oslo and master control

728
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:25,720
with

729
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,840
and back again we don't measure pay
retreat hired getting

730
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,860
hahaha I mean

731
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:38,940
would you agree to its not clear it is
north korea dislike early Nurse Corps I

732
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,610
would say

733
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:44,670
but there's no bimbo three memos and go
straight to your projects

734
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:49,570
yeah I don't get most of it

735
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,000
who but it's tough

736
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,710
um I mean at least baby someone know
what you're talking about because

737
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,430
I guess they know what the topic of
their company at least

738
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:04,629
wats a the next song is a

739
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:09,080
in German we call it should I know ok so
should I mean speak

740
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,150
and of course means rock so I'm not sure
if it's bacharach

741
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:16,700

744
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:27,030

it's too to bat for it but a rock song

745
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:30,390

787
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:15,340

788
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:18,109
tired

789
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:21,200
past

790
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:28,200

and of course there's lots of Qatar
winking you know year gay gay gay gay

792
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:48,519

stupid lines yeah

793
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:52,420
a technology entitlement you doing with
speeds

794
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,979
commitment integrity you care you wat

moving fast forward baby

797
00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:06,319
it's the idea here okay if so

798
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:11,249
a what's this guy name make re re is
singing about

799
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:17,039
is reality his always stressing it's
real this time the dot com world it's

800
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:18,219
real this time

801
00:51:18,219 --> 00:51:22,559
I mean even the corporations like up
Texas Instruments it's completely

802
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:23,650
virtual nowadays

803
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,180
I mean there's it's completely 1 I'm
sure there's nothing really

804
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:30,699
but there's this guy before me stupid
rocks oMG

805
00:51:30,699 --> 00:51:34,769
standing there with both feet on the
ground

806
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:39,410
like some I don't know some Texas Ranger
waiting to she chewed some Mexicans

807
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:44,308
yeah and %uh Hispanic yeah X 30 the
Cypress really can't do it

808
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,749
baby fuckin were actually it's fuckin
venture capital

809
00:51:47,749 --> 00:51:51,319
all out there okay there is nothing like
a reality

810
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:54,400
in fact that capitalized okay write it
down

811
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,819
I'll make a test later up so

812
00:51:58,819 --> 00:52:02,049
no doubt we're moving the question is in
which direction

813
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:07,019
um and there's the guy with the cell
phone one more time

814
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:11,219
it's such a nice graphic I had to use it
so there's a clear difference between

815
00:52:11,219 --> 00:52:11,709
something

816
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:14,729
the song of Texas Instruments tries to

817
00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:19,249
tell the employee Stan you know that
though the rednecks

818
00:52:19,249 --> 00:52:23,969
other it makes a hip-hop sunk the last
up

819
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:27,359
a song for tonight's another actually
clay its

820
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:31,279
a that will allow once played a full
song because I really like it's a really

821
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:32,130
nice to you

822
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:36,109
and its kinda set the next song is spy

823
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:39,190
really big Japanese corporations called
for cheats in

824
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,279
okay so Japan of course has a long
tradition of corporate anthems

825
00:52:44,279 --> 00:52:47,670
but not only to Venice you hurt

826
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:53,910
today Fujitsu always celebrated the
birthday on the 12th of June

827
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,009
I don't know why maybe it was the
birthday of the founder

828
00:52:58,009 --> 00:53:02,690
whatever 12th June my birthday is the
13th of June so that's where it somehow

829
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:06,979
like it's and the sun's out power plant
fis to offer cheap slut lets

830
00:53:06,979 --> 00:53:10,339
on the planet's with a translations

831
00:53:10,339 --> 00:53:13,430
up with the following translations of
for

832
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:17,989
that the song's lyrics because of course
it was originally Japanese

833
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:21,589
I have a copy of the English version of
the song

834
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:25,849
it's a little bit strange it's actually
not badly translated but

835
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:29,390
use you see it's a really quick UK and
so

836
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:32,459
they are not singing it anymore a

837
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:36,380
anyone wants to guess why they don't
sing the song anymore

838
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,809
any guess

839
00:53:39,809 --> 00:53:46,130
euro from the industry nah tonight's not
hold the sexist but the German spot for

840
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:46,559
cheats

841
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,109
siemens bought for cheats and of course
of the cement spot for g2 this 8a

842
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:55,699
we stop with your stupid coburn anthem a

843
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:59,709
I mean we don't need it we don't have
one but you don't want to hear your so K

844
00:53:59,709 --> 00:54:05,059
so germans don't see this out for some
stuff to dancing

845
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:08,459
okay I am and austrians to of course

846
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:11,890
so the next song nobody

847
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,420
is singing the song anymore and that's
why I played a full song

848
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,609
and I want you to sing with me and with

849
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:21,969

852
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:33,059

I'm exhausted I'm Austrian

913
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:26,349
I have a strange jet like but somehow I
feel

914
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:29,470
that I got my message across

915
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:32,890
physically heads

916
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:37,259
events and because I'm sweating like a
pig

917
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:40,580
a there is a possibility for

918
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,810
an encore for the

919
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,250
pie so

920
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,980
it's a special kinda phone callers

921
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,000
because we have monochrome a faults

922
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,480
a nice song that could be the corporate
anthem of the whole conference

923
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:06,310
because we're working together to so
many people from so many different

924
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:07,609
countries here

925
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:12,830
