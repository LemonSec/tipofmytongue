1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,300
I'm so this subject to the talk when it
tonight is on

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,430
its kinda two-part think it's called 30
media

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,840
art activism in computer caricatures and
so what kind of like broadly wanna talk

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,209
about

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,550
-ism this kind of like wave and new
media art that

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:19,800
moves towards instead of I'm treating
technologies as a kind of ideal

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,830
I'm country son is complicated qualified

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,350
I'm kinda dirty messy comes thanks and

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,240
in taking that approach and how a lot of
artists and hackers and activists are

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,910
able to

11
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:34,329
kinda bland the the kind divisions
between those three roles

12
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:37,760
and really kinda embrace all three laws
rules at once and this is something

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,170
that's been happening since the 70s era
written and more purpose since the

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:41,720
sixties

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,850
in a video art and conceptual art in and
immediate

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,980
so this piece that's running right now
is a

17
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:52,920
performance by am Morgan heavy flowers
and Brendan put a

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,309
happen in 2007 in Chicago at a space
called enemy

19
00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,430
and and Brennan were going to work with
um

20
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,888
VCR's like running into audio mixers and
running into been boxes and back another

21
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:05,740
VCR's

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,030
the bill is really kind of complicated
I'm systems

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,219
out have fun basically signal flow and
kinda perverting the signal in different

24
00:01:13,219 --> 00:01:13,670
ways

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,509
and to produce this like really fucked
up effects I'm

26
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:20,850
so they're already kind of like working
with this isn't you know

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,539
suffer necessarily but they're they're
working with um with systems or

28
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:26,219
something working with electronic
systems

29
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:30,579
they're designed kind of from the ground
up to the broken or in some other we

30
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,060
kinda complicated or damaged

31
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,719
there's a writer and artist's name St
fuller that on

32
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,310
that whose work is like kinda
underpinning a lot of what's happening

33
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:41,840
in the stock

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,369
and and he threw a song about software
if he's to work with the

35
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,590
group called on I O T the data service
reserve

36
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,049
like software zines the earliest on
floppy disk on the did

37
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,429
stuff like renamed all their files on
your computer into poetry or something

38
00:01:55,429 --> 00:01:56,279
like that really kind of

39
00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:01,020
agro kinda punk and at can affect how
they react like this disc releases

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,219
likely gonna see this crisis or
something but they were

41
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,899
viruses her for the record buyers and
and so

42
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,240
when I just like go over a few things
that

43
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,070
Matthew for brings up in a paper that he
wrote was published earlier this year

44
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,890
and the cult's

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,660
suffer studies lexicon and the papers
called the stuff to suffer in

46
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,799
cut functions as the introduction to I'm
to the collection that the he edited the

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,940
suffer States lexicon

48
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,150
ceases to things in this introduction
their

49
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,010
their I'm really cut focusing first talk
and the first thing is that

50
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,329
software and and in this case I'd like
to broaden our understanding of suffered

51
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,650
a couple that equated

52
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,710
kind of contain any think assistance
based that we're working on anything

53
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,870
with the system is the message or
something I'm so he says

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,800
suffer comprises simply an grimly love a
social relations made systematic and

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,500
unalterable and so what he's talking
about here is

56
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,460
where we take something that's like more
properly kinda grounded as a social

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,190
relationship

58
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,190
and this can be like the example that he
gives -ism

59
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,640
something like the israeli palestine
conflict or something like that this is

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,480
like a social conflict um

61
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,100
and there are ways that we were making
software we make assumptions based on

62
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,020
our positions

63
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,270
in the sofa relations and kinda encoder
positions

64
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:16,130
into the system S Factor some think so
from the example that he refers to is

65
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,470
some

66
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,960
like if you're signing up for Yahoo
email account or something

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,320
and you have a dropdownlist the what
country from in you

68
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,780
identify yourself as being a member the
next to Palestine but it's not an option

69
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,010
the drop-down list so

70
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,750
at that point on it's exposed to you
that the social relation

71
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,470
has been kind of like codified into an
system that you can't alter

72
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,980
into a system where disempowered and
then

73
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,210
another example that that that I like is
some like the kind of gender binary

74
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,520
male-female things is on like every
website

75
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,590
I'm when you 10 menu are making a
profile something is required field

76
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,240
gender and its male females like

77
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,990
either you know second numerate Lister
some things like

78
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,130
an assumption that um comes up that's a
social sumptin

79
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:02,709
if you subscribe like I did to the
generating a kind a social construct or

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,930
something I'm

81
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,190
it's a social something that comes out
in a technical way when

82
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:10,800
the developers looking at like what's
all the data need to store well K

83
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,750
one thing is gender and what day to take
his gender well its okay its binary or

84
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,089
something or two new ArrayList

85
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,939
or something that I'm whereas if you
like you know if you're that down from

86
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,699
ingress or something like that maybe
cancer like Specter or something

87
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,560
so another thing that and

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,840
for says this is flexo the that's that's
most software for Matthew foremost

89
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,840
assistance this work for Matthew
Phillips I'm but then

90
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,479
Inc there's another kind of like body of
work that his interest and he's trying

91
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,430
to push

92
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,409
he says by contrast when technology is
used in a way that's

93
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:45,129
it his were in terrible much because
it's hackable

94
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:47,969
were open to question and when
technology is used in a way that

95
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,659
santeria for Hagel

96
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:53,949
it allows me churches those subjects
network torrent enmeshed within it to

97
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:54,889
gain traction

98
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:58,460
on its multiple scales operation okay is
kinda art speaker something but alter

99
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,460
you don't like flossie speaker something
but I was really saying is from

100
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,498
when the suffers implemented as an
incomplete project

101
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:07,860
in other words when um I'm gonna when
i'm creating that

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,370
like form for you to fill out to sign up
for myspace and I say

103
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,029
you know like well let's let the user
choose the data type and/or I say let's

104
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:16,729
let these at a field or something

105
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,389
when I leave a cut open to question what
the system actually isn't represented in

106
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,169
that way

107
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:25,128
and then that lets but lets people like
take a position that lets people become

108
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:25,749
empowered

109
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:30,360
in a cup sit within the system in a in a
way where they have agency or something

110
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,409
them so this work actually this is kinda
funny to this this is like

111
00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,330
video documentation its performance and
like the DV tape cut even so this is

112
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,349
holding a later flight

113
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:42,580
awesome kind of like fact that good
stuff happening in there something

114
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,279
that's

115
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,800
aka

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,620
so I like as an example the kinda system
that was

117
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,349
bill broken bottle opener built them up
in a questioner hackable from the start

118
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:59,089
on show another piece that's from the
same same screening which was this was a

119
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:00,529
screening for realtor

120
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:07,490
live kinda night a performance called
real time that happened in a 2007

121
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,460
and this one does have senate sprinkler

122
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,460
lives

123
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,840
K

124
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,350
experiences

125
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,680
sex

126
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,220
me

127
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,570
so

128
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,139
yes

129
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:52,470
yes

130
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:56,449
school

131
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,040
so

132
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,880
so

133
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,380
so

134
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,380
heists so

135
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,009
so

136
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:18,120
so

137
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,640
so

138
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,640
just so

139
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,930
sauce

140
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,080
sucks

141
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,380
just

142
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:41,280
so

143
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,130
yes

144
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,409
rises

145
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,930
hi yeah

146
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:58,930
yeah yes

147
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,040
so he actually won played for like
another 10 minutes but

148
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,920
and basically what he was doing was a
here kind of like video

149
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,220
feedback set up with that panel
television that he was like directly

150
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,900
shocking

151
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,110
with teaser head a.m. so and even the

152
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,880
kind of like life span of the piece
wasn't until the get until the

153
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,920
television tires

154
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,380
I'm so in this way he kind of like takes
the

155
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,680
the television system you know which the
system the really in culture to

156
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,840
and and like i neva aggressively like
turns it into a hackable system or

157
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,890
something like that it's like any kind
of invasive

158
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,630
playfully kinda invasive way um there's
another

159
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,080
artists that I wanna show now this is
some an excerpt from a up

160
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,800
film like you medical science a late
tonight it's by Chris Marker it's like

161
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,930
that pretty famous for them

162
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,150
at 10 see the documentary I'm began

163
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,250
where his is looking at and here how

164
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,980
people can take kind of and political
situations and cuddle invasive Lee

165
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,980
packed with now Yemeni crews found a
solution

166
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,670
if the images that the present don't
change

167
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,569
and change the image is that the past
cue

168
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,940
job with the classes that the sixties
treated by synthesizing

169
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,550
pictures that unless defective he says
with the complex mathematics knows you

170
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,600
see on television

171
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,290
at least they proclaim themselves to be
what they are images

172
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:30,290
not the portable compact for 11 already
inaccessible reality think allow

173
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,140
causes machines world his own

174
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,140
a homage to confiscate tho

175
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,460
on

176
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,950
on for I'm

177
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:57,950
highway

178
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:05,300
ass on

179
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:07,820
in

180
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,769
for

181
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:12,040
on

182
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,529
in

183
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:15,540
in

184
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,829
in

185
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,220
right now either brought back to me like
a shattered hologram was an intact

186
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,360
fragment the generation of the sixties

187
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,550
it in love with a delusion Cisco too
hard

188
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,980
I can say that I don't get it was a
generation that often exasperated make

189
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,290
cool

190
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,319
so

191
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,570
yeah I mean the students that make sense
it's like a looking at reality is

192
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,220
something we can filter process in

193
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,200
and arrange another system kinda open it
up in any way and opening up our

194
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,470
relationship to

195
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,810
mediated images or something away by
kind of like week you know with with

196
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,610
this this tool the the zone the

197
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,530
synthesizer rex i thinkI the zone is
like the material comes as a synthesizer

198
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,850
notices has called

199
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,290
on the sets as kind of an artist made to
all the essence as a furry processing

200
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,890
reality or for bring some filters on
reality or something

201
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,000
and yes cuts

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,370
son so lay which sprint ethnic

203
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,300
Creek yessir focusing up

204
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:25,300
yet its French

205
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:32,070
good as fire

206
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,510
up

207
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:42,470
good so is this video synthesizer like
an interesting to you because

208
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,890
and because they're I they often kinda
function as our works

209
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,370
and cell C know they're like highly
stylized other talked about in a really

210
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:50,780
kinda

211
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,050
interesting stylized way by the the
artists developers artis hardware

212
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,240
hackers artist programmers are something
that build them

213
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,830
um and one of the kinder early video
synthesizers

214
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:05,100
is some are when the cat the kind most
popularly the essence as urs by this guy

215
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,020
from Chicago dance Indian who

216
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,829
I'm works then still does at the
electronic visualization lever USC

217
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:15,300
and he built a machine called the
sanding image processor that was a

218
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,030
at sellers like an analog computer for
doing and video signal processing this

219
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,680
really cool

220
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,050
and he worked with thing film or not

221
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,630
whose like a the artists and actors from
the 70's and her

222
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,910
you know he had a long career I'm but so
I'm

223
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,579
ownership is from to an excerpt from if
video by

224
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,600
someone called general motors and which
is

225
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,580
it you can't find it on Google Video &
we've uploaded to Google the a

226
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,740
its its super crazy like it should
really check a

227
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,370
this excerpt shows and a kind a walk
through of

228
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,910
there's a little bit the sand image
processor and it's mostly about this

229
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,500
kind of like

230
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,400
programming interface and I think the
one they're using here's grass

231
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,830
which is the I'm graphics subsystem or
something a stencil mean we know it

232
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,680
that they really mean that it's
something that's like this kinda

233
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,030
programming interface reading graphics
that actually the

234
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:08,020
Death Star sequence in a new hope was
developed by Lurkey by using this

235
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:08,790
interface right

236
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,170
you know so Yemeni Pathans died in the
protectionist no

237
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:19,600
to give you a lot of pop star in this
laboratory in their chemistry department

238
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,950
well

239
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,190
take you over the computer here

240
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:27,180
this thing obey houses the graphics
computer and

241
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,290
this down here courses the PDP 11:45
computer

242
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:37,290
behind this panel is twenty eight
thousand words memory

243
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,150
this here is the this tried the mess
storage medium Lee is to hold pictures

244
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,620
and I macros and other information is to
run the graphics system

245
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,300
up here is the ATT converters which
allow issues dials and knobs and sliders

246
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,540
and other things to consolidate his

247
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,209
on the computer's memory guy wires that
go over that the general and as you can

248
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,610
see the elected General had

249
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,089
is capable of putting up images in real
time writing them around we do there's

250
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,550
point TV cameras at them

251
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,560
little TV cameras like this week you can
move around in center and a

252
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,740
get different parts on the screen and
then because color

253
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,420
is much more fun in black and white the
run cables over this way

254
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,980
to a very powerful person then sending

255
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,770
invent an image processor

256
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,790
now the basic way we do things here as
we take

257
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,730
images from the vector dunno route them
via cables to the image processor

258
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,050
colorized them and

259
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,870
tape-record them yeah the single thing
that's hard disk communicate the paper

260
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,680
like this

261
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,430
is the interactivity at the system

262
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,610
fences anything they can be controlled
in the system can be consoled

263
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,860
so the SSI potentiometers are dials like
these

264
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,840
what we're going to do now is show you
how I make up simple objects like this

265
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,920
first you can see the from rights are
fighting a screen showing only work

266
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,240
but there are lights off

267
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,870
always have the colors

268
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,960
alright so actually still of what we've
done here is perhaps an infrared lights

269
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,589
and class II over there has that
infrared sensitive camera

270
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,839
so we can show you the working
environment their own

271
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,240
there are actually doing things and
still get high-quality

272
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,320
video without the rights the regular TV
cameras are not sensitive

273
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,500
so infrared light

274
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,890
doesn't mean to do to show you how we
make this that I love flying start small

275
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,490
like he always restart the system

276
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,810
the

277
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,680
also superimposing the BTO fides I on
the screen

278
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,420
the

279
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,180
we get the start not go out

280
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,310
and we get the propeller

281
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,520
from the desk

282
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:13,520
saying anyone does houses rotate them
the

283
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:21,299
right that there's been a long axis the

284
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:23,499
so this some kinda interesting happening
there when

285
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:27,679
they've got the code superimposed over
to output to the code or something

286
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,879
and he's like kinda walking through the
code in this very and very open kinda

287
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:35,459
where something is kinda how-to video
something but it's also on

288
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,929
it's also this thing that's very popular
right now the Scott live coding

289
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:42,929
and and up so you a little bit have you
don't need it because the

290
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,019
music is a new animated and but

291
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,029
webster et al

292
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:52,199
known as grady's

293
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,190
up

294
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,870
okay so this is a tool called fluxes
herman's this is taken from a kinda

295
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:03,870
workshop about his fluxes successes like

296
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:07,270
guess it's live coding tool is a punch
in the nose X supercollider is really

297
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,079
popular one

298
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,419
on in there and their performance tools

299
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,500
but and this group of people I'm heard
that there are some I kind of like

300
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,859
life during the stop lap as a group is
coming Arts Collective

301
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,890
their own the light curing and they have
this kind of like they're very good

302
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,330
dogma 95 or something like that they
have these rules about how it has to go

303
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:25,859
down

304
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,330
and so one thing that has to happen is
that and that you have to have your

305
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,780
process you have to be reading all the
code where performing

306
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,770
and you have to have your text editor
whatever displayed so success is a

307
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,650
you know VGA tool basically um in this
design in the same way as as

308
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,670
that grass if that was crass I think its
crest I'm

309
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:46,950
so that code is getting edited you know
like on top of

310
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,080
the thing the codes actually is kinda
interesting and a a

311
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,360
enid stage waving the code is actually
in front of the

312
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
have the named DJ stuff is happening in
back into the this code is really kind

313
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,960
in the foreground

314
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,960
that's akin it like openness the you
know this

315
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,260
this kinda ethics have open source
around a lot as I can to bring me dr.

316
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,830
and I'm not all that love it and so I
think that that's maybe where some love

317
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,850
that kind of like ethical impetus to do
this is coming from

318
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,490
so that is also this country formats
have mastery of like being super awesome

319
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,790
they're running scheme comes really fast
like at

320
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,770
crazy spider Taurus duets and super
trips have shit

321
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,139
and an influx SSX audio inputs you can
sync it to

322
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,540
like cheesy dance music is you want to

323
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:35,000
you

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,720
shadows up

325
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:44,080
you

326
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,929
so one thing that that is different
about the approach

327
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,070
have something like and grass or zone or

328
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,570
the at send UNITE HERE successes um

329
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,639
the there there's like a part of the I'm
a part of that

330
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,390
ap thats like you know curve I'm
compromise their artistic where

331
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,020
something like a printer artistic onto

332
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,389
the mostly just tools and they're often
to talk to critique

333
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,130
up strictly in terms of being tools but
in this could have

334
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,620
in and the way that I wanna talk about
and dirty in the media are the way I

335
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,190
wanna talk about that category of art

336
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,600
and is that there's not a there's no
distinction made between

337
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,860
tools and and you know the output of the
tools or something

338
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,540
I'm in other words a a people often talk
about software

339
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,990
as some about the ideology the
prevailing ideology it suffers think

340
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,090
I've utilitarianism

341
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,290
and you know we think it suffers a black
box or something me

342
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,970
like think it suffers a a processor or
something like that in other words

343
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:40,120
suffer something that you do inputs
hearing you get output from its

344
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,130
it's completely utilitarian I'm and and
forward

345
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,060
for this kegger dirty media like to add
liked it think of a kind a more expanded

346
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,450
you know there's a way in which suffer
functions ideologically in a clean

347
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:52,310
utilitarian moon

348
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,490
but there's also like all kinds of weird
shit happening at the edges there's like

349
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,150
a lot a literary stuff happening in

350
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,170
I like Microsoft Word or something you
know they're they're like

351
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,380
real decisions being made about the
language that cease their

352
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,380
and there's like you know user interface
design is them

353
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:10,080
you know could have being talked about
often as a fairly precise science but

354
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,350
there's something to do in there too

355
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,480
and there's some cultural assumptions
that bubble up in user interface design

356
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm so there

357
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,510
so there are some artists working now
they're really focused on that like

358
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,750
really focused on taking

359
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,630
I'm kinda suffer applications they're
not meant to be

360
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,920
and art you know not to be used to make
art or something

361
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,190
and making art from them are making them
into our in the same way

362
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,160
in the sky like daughter ready it's it's
in the same way that like Marcel Duchamp

363
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,100
takes I urinal in particular because at
the fountain or something like that

364
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,120
and in a in a similar kind of way this
is a piece by

365
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,830
jodie which is a dual Dutch artists um

366
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:53,830
this is a piece called I'm my desktop
Oct

367
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,700
of my quest all I

368
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,020
to rate I

369
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,139
copyright small talk to see see

370
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:14,140
this

371
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,720
on have to have to stop

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:30,710
and on good

389
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,300
good luck

390
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,060
yeah yeah

391
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:44,350
ok yeah

392
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,990
yeah

393
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,040
yeah

394
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,700
wah

395
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,340
ok okay

396
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,740
okay

397
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:09,310
sect can agree

398
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:12,520
there was sells for the process as jodie

399
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,230
who and their website is chilling at
work

400
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,730
and that he says called my desktop

401
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,290
David they were kinda in the kinda net
are

402
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,470
be a new leader where they were kinda
canonical piece it's uncalled wrong

403
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,440
browser

404
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,270
you know this comes from the late 90's
where that there was this like

405
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:36,110
constructive like you're using the wrong
browser something that was like really

406
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,270
part of the weather

407
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:40,389
or you I'm securities up

408
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,820
so these is another piece that's along a
number similar lines by

409
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,760
are slim chance at room lives in Chicago

410
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,140
this is called ground zero

411
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,350
information can also be added to
automatically appear whenever you create

412
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:01,170
a purchase order or enter a purchase for
the vendor

413
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:08,170
good

414
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,490
good

415
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,539
the

416
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,559
the

417
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:27,740
good good

418
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,000
cooking an area on the navigation aid
takes you that went with

419
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,610
cooking cooking barbecue

420
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,669
going

421
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,539
you pppp think

422
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,900
while

423
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,419
well

424
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:55,419
wide

425
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:02,509
both

426
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:11,869
it

427
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:29,749
but not

428
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:33,679
speech said

429
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,519
ok well

430
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:47,519
cook your good

431
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:56,269
of p 12 information p he

432
00:27:04,229 --> 00:27:11,229
idk

433
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:14,749
so this another thing that comes up in
those last two pieces especially in

434
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:15,450
John's work

435
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:18,539
and as this kind of like henry give its
like super play for free

436
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,289
and as like a real strong kinda
relationship to video games and the

437
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:23,549
Italian culture like this

438
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,989
you know he's Second Life to construct
is here you for parts that

439
00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:30,779
he also on the part where the deer's
like jumping up on that platform in

440
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:34,709
john has a lot to work with the Sun game
development tool and I was 10 collect

441
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:35,389
power game

442
00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:38,549
builder or something like that making
these kinda crazy platform games at a

443
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:43,079
elements from user interfaces in like
ridiculous and it gets the funds online

444
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:43,450
so

445
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:46,999
so and that the kinda playful thing is
also like and

446
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,809
a really powerful tool as i've seen.
employed in this

447
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:53,849
again montauk minister in the media and
it's like a its

448
00:27:53,849 --> 00:27:57,208
functions a really powerful tool for
kind of like cutting across hierarchies

449
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:57,690
are kinda

450
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,489
you're cutting across all these
different like Matthew for talks with

451
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:02,989
all these different layers at which
suffers operating

452
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:06,349
is like ideological heirs that economic
layer in Suffolk than

453
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:09,200
and for you know for him it's really
important to like when critiquing

454
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,259
software

455
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,549
when critiquing immediate come at it you
know it's like a very

456
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:17,209
multi-layered thing or something so I'm
this playfulness can just release place

457
00:28:17,209 --> 00:28:18,459
through all those different layers

458
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:21,829
like you know cut them all at once it's
kind of like in them you know like

459
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:25,009
like that the carnival or something like
that you know it's like a dollar

460
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:28,989
flattening hierarchies just for a night
or something in you know in a playful

461
00:28:28,989 --> 00:28:29,469
way

462
00:28:29,469 --> 00:28:35,190
um and so that relationship to video
games and and game culture and plan

463
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,769
stuff is

464
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:39,529
is kinda where I'm gonna try to connects
the stuff with the

465
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:42,700
devil seen which I don't think I'm gonna
show

466
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,459
are not pressure too much because i
think is probably something them the a

467
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:46,959
lot of people here familiar with

468
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:50,499
and and and if you know if you're not
familiar with anyone more information we

469
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:51,019
should

470
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,279
I'm look at like interesting scott is is
here he knows like

471
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,369
you noticed a lot of like a circle
worker and I'm also gym later this

472
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:58,599
tunnel in the collection

473
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:01,619
collecting all demos and stuff but
basically the and

474
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:05,159
did kinda beginnings are the demo saying
we're in

475
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,489
wherein pirating video games so like I
am you know if I'm

476
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:12,419
cracks like a new floppy have and super
off road

477
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:16,729
and I want everybody to know that it was
my crew the crack tickets were the

478
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:18,159
leaders shit unblock

479
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,659
and so I'm gonna put some sweet manner
like up in front of it you know

480
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,700
and then like in after a while I was
like well

481
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,219
and need to make a lot of shout outs in
a kind running a space so

482
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:33,029
maybe if there's a way I can animate on
a show ask that like 700 show doubts I'm

483
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:38,450
so what kinda grew outta that is the Sun
this conflict for both having these

484
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,479
awesome animations that play in front of
them the games that you crack 20

485
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:43,299
redistribute them

486
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:46,599
and then there's SO these interesting
technical restrictions because I'm you

487
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,249
know some the games maybe they do you
like a check summer something

488
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:53,369
or maybe they me there's not very much
room left on the disc anyway so maybe a

489
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:54,259
limited to like

490
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:57,829
4k for your code or something so then
then you get to be super early because

491
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,200
now you can make this crazy

492
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,029
graphical intro and you on these 4k a
coat or something that's the kind of

493
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,549
like um

494
00:30:03,549 --> 00:30:06,759
you know to his with origins the demoss
I was gonna show one I'm

495
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:10,309
crack and shows as from 1990 this is by
a cull paradox on

496
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:17,309
skilled workers

497
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,559
say this

498
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,330
very

499
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,918
said this big ones had a you really
playful stuff going on here

500
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,360
and and still you know part of the

501
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,019
devil say now there's like a lotta la to
play happening there and which

502
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:44,100
which i think is about her but a which i
think is about the

503
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,210
ever seen um its you know it's not it's
not like

504
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,549
directly or in a still has some ties to
suffer piracy in there still like

505
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:54,690
and they're still in art scene an ASCII
seem especially for doing info files for

506
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,659
I'm tired suffer and but but you know
has a pretty

507
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:01,860
I'm pretty robust relationship to the
rest of the kinda stuff /url to the

508
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,110
press the new media world at this point
me know there's like all the stuff work

509
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,630
graphics card companies get you know
really lead ever coaters to do the

510
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,610
graphics for the new

511
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:15,809
video card or something like that and so
I think the playfulness is there

512
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:18,970
and now still and and was there in the
beginning to

513
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:22,260
kinda you know help connect this kind of
like grassroots

514
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,750
I'm digital artwork that was happening
inference that is kinda like

515
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,880
illegal you know and by illegal you know
that there could have

516
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,200
includes like marginalized you know it's
kinda marginalize to work this happening

517
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,990
to cut cut through that into the

518
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,980
body of the rest of the kinda software
art suffered short what's happening

519
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,350
um I profession shows or not but the
archives

520
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,350
I last at last

521
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,460
block party has no block party which is
it's like a demo party

522
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,510
competition thing in in Cleveland its

523
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,990
this was the second year it's a test and
not a conscious coming into congress

524
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,649
and Jason Scott and rad man from an
asset like

525
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:03,940
organizing I'm so so

526
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,389
I work at this critical critical are
where and I'm

527
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:10,659
were were like an oven artist collective
concerned

528
00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:13,679
ours for a concert and then we went like

529
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,549
two years ago we made a demo animus like
we got last place which was very sweet

530
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:20,668
and and then we went again

531
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:24,440
this year and we made another demo them
a show you

532
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,529
a.m. and we're hoping to church open for
last place

533
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,620
I'm but we we actually just got
disqualified first

534
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:38,620
it's not quite like this quayle as well
for good

535
00:32:54,590 --> 00:33:01,590
%ah

536
00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:03,168
I

537
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:07,250
I

538
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,570
I

539
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:15,760
cost

540
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,490
for ok

541
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,830
this is more I i think

542
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,630
a you know they have a really nice
machine for the competition to show has

543
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,150
it's a good

544
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,620
slan the year you know dream machine

545
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,670
doesn't run very well on my flat
suffered a it probably would have run

546
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,490
really well

547
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:40,750
is that yours is the budget fucked up
stuff for Windows bouncing all over the

548
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,210
place

549
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,670
I'm and that video that was a

550
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,620
there was playing the beginning was
Jason Scott dancing in front of our demo

551
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,059
for

552
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:54,350
the aforesaid good by Ives

553
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:57,669

to do since we

561
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,250
sec yet know why I disable that cuz I
always had an accident

um but actually I can get to the

563
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:38,639
virtual consoles short oh yeah very good

thanks still officially at that from
Julio AFP

566
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,918
could I'm so I guess what I'd like to do
is like

567
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,960
try to reboot this and I'm you know we
still have like maybe

568
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,030
15 minutes or so it's a maybe I could
just take questions and then we did in

569
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,520
the days when I say this one other

570
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,160
pieces wah

571
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,450
yep should

572
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:16,270
so arm yet to get simony any questions
are

573
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:19,310
to answer anything like that

574
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,770
your I'll

575
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:28,290
you can ask Jason if I mean I think it
was some you know I mean

576
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:32,220
will they said it didn't work okay at
first but and you know and I was like

577
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,210
well yeah

578
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,390
and then they're like and if they say
was also is too hostile

579
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:40,379
arm and you know that's fair senator ok
cool

580
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,840
yeah yes talk about it they were I

581
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,830
awesome with I was awesome to do it
during the event to

582
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:53,960
okay cool alright hi re 106 got

583
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:58,780
I run a party called block party at nada
con which is next week on held up in

584
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,620
Cleveland Ohio we're having another one

585
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,930
next year I mean April 2009

586
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:07,910
anyway so what are the things that block
party is it's based off a

587
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:11,259
for European done a party with our
various demos that are shown

588
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,280
others also music pieces graphics pieces
in other words cannot show

589
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,230
and from what we encountered

590
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,880
the first time we saw their work from
the first one we simply assumed it was

591
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,110
some sort of prank

592
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,520
for and that's where those things that
can really be

593
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,890
interpret see that like if you have

594
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:37,049
if you having if you're having a music
contest in some comes over in shifts in

595
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,720
the tuba

596
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,720
and and defecate in it that's at the
shop he says talking I think that was it

597
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,290
so you know a big he goes oh no no no

598
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:52,450
at sunset in b-flat from the judges

599
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,390
have to make the decision whether or not
it will change the tenor

600
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,120
so anyway so when the second one came
and opened up multiple windows

601
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,160
on the desktop and then started to act
really weird and send out a new ways

602
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,810
that would kill a chicken he had to make
a decision that would not want to play

603
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,529
it over a multi 1000 watt

604
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:17,200
system at people but

605
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,380
actually to bring it back to his
beautiful talk here that's part of the

606
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,680
problem when you kinda

607
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:25,859
stretch the boundaries of what is Artin
what is music and sometimes you will

608
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,360
just not be appreciated

609
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,560
dali was considered a pretty weird out
ignored person until he had a fight

610
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,509
over a placement up some are in his
gallery and he threw a bathtub through a

611
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,190
window

612
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,720
game the resulting press from that got a
lot more interesting history list work

613
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,470
before then

614
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,860
and was part of his road to success so
what I'm telling them is that they

615
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,480
should throw about them through the
window

616
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:51,370
anyway cool thanks for the info ok no
problem

617
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:56,770
ok Inc

618
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,020
askew the thing about multiple windows
we're like how we're pushing some

619
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:04,750
you know word we did something with this
and the there

620
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,820
thanks to its ok it's um

621
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,230
so I'm just gonna show so this one other
peace and then

622
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,900
its in cortelli will have time for like
just a couple questions or something are

623
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Maidana which

624
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,760

on

638
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,230
sons

639
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:37,230
this

640
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:46,099
you

641
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:59,900
as

642
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:06,900
by

643
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:16,949
on

644
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,279
so I I love peace it's a

645
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,710
grotesque you can collect with a few

646
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,860
free out admired a

647
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,630
our processes that trio its and a chance
after each other

648
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:35,930
round conservative and MJ since all day
and

649
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,879
robbery and so Rob ranges and saw your
sound artists and they're working with

650
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,410
like a lot circuit and equipment and and
then John does the

651
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,990
video and and then he some sense to
sometimes and so he's he uses

652
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,610
and some circuit bent video equipment
it's like and the that his bill

653
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,370
and then also like one other things with
sign that video was on a kind of

654
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:57,549
prepared Excel spreadsheet exciting was
an OpenOffice spreadsheet but

655
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:00,310
you can prepare to take you to scroll
through it and would do this weird

656
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:03,090
interference patterns with that stuff
and he's using all over the

657
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,270
you know expose stuff like that like
jodie used in them

658
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,990
the ok okay so

659
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,280
just a little bit and even to like
Warner were two questions have I'm

660
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,520
decade party they were in your mind is
the microphones they're lookin

661
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,800
my current the back your representative
ok after

662
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,240
stick Apple

663
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,339
up

664
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,509
I'll are are you asking me if the pie
country 0

665
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:38,019
if if my demo runs on the iPhone yeah
that's a really good question

666
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:41,199
um I know I don't have an iPhone but um

667
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,539
yeah currency wanna unsealed we

668
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,919
yeah could did say good

669
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:51,058
not

670
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:54,959
of yeah it's a it's kinda funny here
suffered be described as something it's

671
00:43:54,959 --> 00:43:57,558
a rigid women waterways as wanna more
malleable

672
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:01,549
from the mirror had a a completely
recognize the kinda constraints and

673
00:44:01,549 --> 00:44:03,839
ideologies a time and I'm wondering if
its

674
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,229
helpful for you or have you thought
about suffer being I'm

675
00:44:07,229 --> 00:44:11,609
compare more architecture as a system
love a building things that recognizes

676
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:12,038
the

677
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:15,219
the ideologies and economies in layers
that are implicit in the kinds of things

678
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,199
that we're creating

679
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:20,509
who I like that we're talking about it
on II like cum

680
00:44:20,509 --> 00:44:23,649
I like we said about thinking of think
it's %uh first thing malleable verse

681
00:44:23,649 --> 00:44:24,259
persisting

682
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:26,999
you know I'm because these that is that
is another way that suffers talk to a

683
00:44:26,999 --> 00:44:28,929
very often yes about being super
valuable

684
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:32,999
and I'm and and also the the kind of
output of the you know when we talk

685
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:33,369
about

686
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:36,729
Miley billion suffer kinda talking to
two stages right we're talking with the

687
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:40,559
state recoding enter architecting or
something which I consider using it and

688
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:43,219
and at both the state is there is like a
kind of

689
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:46,239
a kind attention between million billion
and rigidity a

690
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:49,779
so in and we're saying about
architecture is that and you think that

691
00:44:49,779 --> 00:44:52,009
where architectures that now is that is
dealing with this

692
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:55,029
all these layers that include qualified
where something is that well to the

693
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:55,919
extent that

694
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:59,019
suffered being used to create
environments now it is yeah okay

695
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:03,189
mediate in the human interactions in its
domain that's been well understood in

696
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:04,089
regarded in

697
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:07,159
so the notion that some architects is
beginning to resemble

698
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:11,449
traditional architecture is a leading
arc is sorta the way I've been trying to

699
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:12,189
think about it

700
00:45:12,189 --> 00:45:15,489
your cool in there you know there are a
lot of arm kinda arcs

701
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:18,359
kinda architecture products they're more
in arts I that we could really look at

702
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:18,999
um

703
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:22,699
in in terms of like opening up our
thinking to color making really radical

704
00:45:22,699 --> 00:45:24,130
suffer attacks right now there's like

705
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,159
those I'm the some other well there's
like you know the Bucky fuller stuff

706
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,229
it's like a radical and

707
00:45:28,229 --> 00:45:31,979
interesting but then there's also I'm
over the Whitney right now for hours in

708
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,329
town

709
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,759
yeah I'll show on buckle okay

710
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:40,130
X be are are new to the

711
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:46,339
hurry don't think what's up ok it like
Everton were

712
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:52,149
it what's a good like reading framework
for people who don't know this

713
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,439
we don't have this here yeah a you know
i i V's

714
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:58,868
supercollider the it's pretty weird it's
like coming it's kinda like

715
00:45:58,869 --> 00:46:03,739
small talker something's got there
that's cuz legacy editor it's like

716
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:04,729
really eight

717
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:08,219
thats runner-up good references
practically or something um

718
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:12,049
and then there's Chuck which is pretty
cool and Chuck E's is like a I'm

719
00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:16,369
its to as always operators and stuff
it's like it's kind of more Flickr

720
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:20,219
that slimmer procedure or something um
than your list which is both functional

721
00:46:20,219 --> 00:46:22,109
declarative it's like lamar procedural

722
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:25,848
impaired and so which was actually you
know works very well if left a context

723
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:26,999
and and and

724
00:46:26,999 --> 00:46:30,539
are looking for eitan actually in like a
in javascript to you can do

725
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:34,049
like yet cool because you can run you
know like you can use like

726
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:38,439
jQuery or some other jobs just a
framework I'm to just make these like

727
00:46:38,439 --> 00:46:41,569
interesting innovations in the browser
using like Firebug or something you know

728
00:46:41,569 --> 00:46:45,058
we have an interactive JavaScript
interpreter you can make

729
00:46:45,059 --> 00:46:48,319
you could do performances in there play
QuickTime files and stuff so it to do

730
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,929
stuff with Python people just like you
spike in pipeline and

731
00:46:51,929 --> 00:46:55,149
yeah because you can run a letter from
the interpreter right yeah

732
00:46:55,149 --> 00:46:59,808
a total yet a commute me I think we've

733
00:46:59,809 --> 00:47:06,809
and other matters think yet

734
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:13,930
bills cool

735
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:14,649
it was

736
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,660
X except for X Sun Soleil

737
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,220
okay where the other activist
connections or something yet okay cool

738
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,660
I'm well I think one way is

739
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,970
I think the Act love like the kinda
flattening hierarchies

740
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:31,540
that can afflict impulse is is an
actress temples or something on

741
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,740
in terms of like on the streets um kinda
worker something there

742
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,000
the the project that I was doing at
daisy chain um

743
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,630
which is that free computer lever
something I was running was kinda

744
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,180
approaching and computer education as a
place to

745
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:46,980
experiment was kinda radical arts
education um and so that was that was

746
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,900
kind of an activist in 10 also this

747
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,230
fellow amnesty for that I referenced
like several times for the talk

748
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:55,590
is like this super hardcore marxist and
his

749
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,180
and that like a lot of his stuff is
about and you know he talks a lot about

750
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,009
the streets

751
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,640
and he talks a lot about thinking about
how you know he has this kind of

752
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,650
constructive

753
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,930
a street smarts or something three
starts and they're kinda from

754
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,259
like in economic technical

755
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,720
stuff for something like this tactical
strategic to call me a cynic street

756
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,900
smarts it's like being in a bottom-up
grassroots

757
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,930
and radical practice or something see
that's what how can we take our street

758
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:21,580
smarts

759
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,880
you know happily take that and live that
way on the web or something for

760
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,430
you know which the you know whether it's
kinda the focus in the in the mid 90's

761
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,129
stuff like this

762
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:33,200
dialogue about software a in at this
kind of like and critical dialogue about

763
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,110
suffer now we could talk about you know
what lot applications that way

764
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:40,010
whitacre for street street smarts and
and like apply them to our relationships

765
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:41,040
with some for something

766
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,190
I'm cool

767
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,480
okay I think that things like this
