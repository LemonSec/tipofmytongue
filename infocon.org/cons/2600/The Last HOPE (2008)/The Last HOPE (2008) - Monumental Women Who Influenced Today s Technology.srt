1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:07,149
welcome this is actually the second
incarnation of the speech was

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:10,790
beta tested prior concert this is the
finished finalized version other

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,450
welcome to my men to women in the
technology today I am the one they call

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,110
me free

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,460
this presentation has been in the making
for approximately three and a half years

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,010
now

7
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:22,050
and was it in research by a little over
doesn't my friends

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,970
and only be fair being one myself in
being involved in technology

9
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:28,900
I should start by giving you a little
background about myself before we start

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:34,350
I am a recent graduate May 2008

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,570
Pennsylvania College of Technology on
during my four years a complete a six

12
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,579
different reprogram

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,550
they are listed on the slide I do hold
several certifications and it's an

14
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,290
addition to that

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,800
a pleasant and plus for the last three
years I've been a member in good

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,140
standing as well as an officer of the
ACM and IEEE at my college

17
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,239
in 2002 I found it my own consulting
firm

18
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,430
have been working for myself I have
since absorber

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:01,780
another company and have one employee
beneath me a lot is women face the same

20
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,739
hardships that also affected me from the
first day I got to college

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,819
and first SF in the classroom where I
thought it was professionals

22
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:13,329
gender bias eniac was surrounded by

23
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:17,380
issues a sexual tension in the workplace
it was unusually high at that time

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,600
for men unusually hard that time for men
and women working as a migratory or even

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,369
in the same room

26
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:25,770
these women were not were supposed to be
respected in the same level as their

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,700
male coworkers

28
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,909
for example gene Bartek was almost fired

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,319
by the director after a the Moore School
found out she got married

30
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,270
they felt the decision became pregnant
she quit after the first successful

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,740
demonstration any act 1946

32
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,029
female staff decided they were going to
have champagne to celebrate pop the

33
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:44,869
corks and said okay women time to go
home

34
00:01:44,869 --> 00:01:50,849
the original six women have any act to
remain after they married

35
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,060
during that time it was difficult for
women to vote have a career and have

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,639
children

37
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:58,399
so their colleagues really look down on
them as being less important less

38
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,060
intelligent

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,399
just less of a person because they were
married had kids

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,049
as you look into history the treatment
of you know contributions to the science

41
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:07,630
is

42
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,770
there's a lack a female role models for
the new younger generations

43
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,350
I was informed earlier this conference I
consider myself a 22 no longer young

44
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,829
because I can remember certain things
that young today don't

45
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,600
to put in perspective my mother at my
age

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,230
helpful pay scholarship to dip into law
school she really wanted to be a lawyer

47
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,950
she had a brother two years older than
her who really wanted to go to the

48
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,580
sciences

49
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,130
so my grandparents gave all the money
that they had saved up for her

50
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,370
to him to go to college he used his
degree for two years

51
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,960
quit got married and lives of a stock
interest my mother just retired after 37

52
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,930
years teaching used every cent

53
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,110
effort agree that she had to pay for
herself because the woman was going to

54
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,570
use it to yours get married in quick

55
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,140
these

56
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,570
she geeks shape the face of modern
computing because I mention an axe in my

57
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,769
example gender bias

58
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,840
let's start by looking at that in

59
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,300
ice ships this picture is courtesy of
the US Army photographic archives

60
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,610
the IEEE caption a certain way I thought
was really kind of interesting

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:17,100
so few people know that when
participated in the development of early

62
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,710
computers

63
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:21,090
that they were often photographed
obviously posed shots like this one

64
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,540
the eniac programs images such as this
visually demonstrated contrast between

65
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,640
peoples conception of computer hardware

66
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,910
which was usually associate with men
with the reality that women

67
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:37,910
lived and involved in its creation in
years and extends for the electronic

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,390
numerical integrator

69
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,500
and computer and visually program by
grouper 61 women working in the field

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,370
until this time can only be described as
a men-only area

71
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,690
it was code-named project px I was
constructed by the University of

72
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,520
Pennsylvania's Moore School of
Engineering

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,060
it was massive by today's standards
today's computers than your desk in your

74
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,850
purse or pocket just about anywhere

75
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,280
eniac was massive just to give you an
example I have the specs for it

76
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,530
17406 the vacuum tubes

77
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,780
7200 crystal diets 1500 real-life

78
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,700
70,000 resistors 10,000 capacitors and
five million

79
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,269
hand soldered joints wait twenty seven
times with eight-and-a-half feet by 3

80
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:19,840
feet by

81
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,779
83 and consumed 150 kilowatts of power
per our

82
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:28,340
input was done for IBM card reader with
an IBM punch card for output

83
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,939
very pic assembly the behemoth began in
nineteen forty-three

84
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,080
was completed Valentine's Day 1946

85
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,438
for cost a fifty thousand dollars

86
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,629
now I thought fifty thousand dollars for
that time notta lotta money

87
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:47,979
I've checked with the Department of
Labor Statistics according to inflation

88
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:50,080
and all the fun stuff

89
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,550
that's five million five hundred fifty
four dollars and 60s

90
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:58,139
554,000 666 dollars in 67 cents at
today's money

91
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:05,139
little over five and half million

92
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,900
chill the slideshow my laptop is he my
site or three times so far

93
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,999
women were selected to work with any act
because they were regarded as being

94
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:14,439
capable of doing the work

95
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,939
faster and more accurately than their
male counterparts

96
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,150
at one point the Employee List at the
Moore School consisted of eighty women

97
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,729
and three men

98
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:27,099
talk about work ratio initially women
weren't allowed in the same room with

99
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,669
any act because of course it was for
military purposes

100
00:05:29,669 --> 00:05:32,840
and they had to stand behind a glass
partition with all the instruction

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,990
manuals and diagrams and everything else

102
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,379
they were forced to stay there and learn
it themselves when they were finally

103
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,029
what finally allowed in the same room
with the unit

104
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:48,029
most other time was spent just this
clean up after the mail engineers

105
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,309
the women who worked on more school
chose to forgo a traditionally female

106
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,499
career choice

107
00:05:52,499 --> 00:05:55,740
like teaching or nursing to pursue
mathematics

108
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,210
at that time it was generally accepted
careers for college education

109
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,469
work teaching and nursing for women if
they didn't choose that they were

110
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,099
expected to marry reproduce that was the
sole purpose for them

111
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:10,128
these women wanted to apply their
knowledge they wanted to be more so they

112
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:13,629
went to the field of mathematics

113
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,979
programming then was nothing like it is
today it was

114
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:20,449
laboring changing connections and
putting immense amounts of data by punch

115
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:21,159
cards

116
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,449
cabinets & cabinet and counter punch
cards these women

117
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,879
understood the intricacies the design
because they did extensive sales

118
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:31,099
training where the men sat down the
classroom had someone spoon feed it to

119
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,378
them

120
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,889
it was integral to the success is a
demonstration of any act in 1946

121
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,860
starting from that demonstration trend
continuing and talk to her second 1955

122
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,759
hazards up time it was on shutdown once
to expand the memory and to reach you

123
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,659
location

124
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,080
but before any act there were
predecessors whose advances helped make

125
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,619
this possible

126
00:06:56,619 --> 00:07:01,800
some influential in

127
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,860
her birth name was Augusta a to Byron
she was the first legitimate child of

128
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,430
poet Lord Byron

129
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,629
her full name in title for most the for
married life as you see it on a slide

130
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,629
the right and honorable Augusta 8
account to serve Lovelace

131
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,710
she was educated both socially and
culturally because I for affiliation

132
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,309
with the blue stockings

133
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:22,789
society who emphasize education and
discussion literature in cooperation

134
00:07:22,789 --> 00:07:24,509
with educated men

135
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,869
who had to be invited to participate

136
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:31,169
she's known for having written vivid
descriptions of Charles Babbage is early

137
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,460
mechanical general-purpose computer

138
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,099
the Analytical Engine Charles Babbage
was an English professor

139
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,580
Matt Matt and English British professor
mathematics philosopher inventor and

140
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,159
mechanical engineer

141
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,580
I'll enough he was a literate this is
why she had to write own business

142
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,949
it was first described in 1837 but the
average continue to work on the design

143
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,129
until his death in 1871

144
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:57,399
a course we do financial political legal
issues it was never actually built

145
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,309
some believe the technical limitations
at the time 100 the construction

146
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:05,419
but the very anticipated the first
complete a general-purpose computer in

147
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,058
about a hundred years

148
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:11,219
the uncompleted mechanisms are currently
on display at the one museum of science

149
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,659
however in 1991 into something
interesting be built

150
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,069
a perfectly fine she functioning
Difference Engine based on the original

151
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:19,909
description she wrote

152
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,219
it worked that is also designed a
printer

153
00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:26,719
the Analytical Engine there was
assembled in the year two thousand

154
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,680
and that concluded that and stars in
complex device in nineteenth-century

155
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,490
it to what worked

156
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,100
sheen Kloza said notes with the article
the specified in complete detail

157
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,380
a method for calculating Bernoulli's
numbers using the Analytical Engine

158
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,640
this is recognized by historians as the
world's first computer program

159
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,560
for her work better stay for the title
The Enchantress of numbers

160
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,200
she also noted some possibilities in the
machine was babbitt's never published

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,550
she hypothesized in her notes that the
engine might one day compose

162
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,829
elaborate and scientific pieces of music
any degree of complexity York's that

163
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:07,840
average himself only really focused on
tackling numbers number crunching

164
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:14,650
and things that would better than men to
society she thought outside the box

165
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,620
unfortunately she died at the age of 36

166
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,840
her physician at that time use blood
leading to try and cure uterine cancer

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,690
and she bled out and I she left behind
two sons and a daughter

168
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,350
was buried next to her father whom she
really never know

169
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,430
the computer language 8 was created by
the US Defense Department

170
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:38,570
and named after her military standard
associated with it mial

171
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,460
STD 1815 was given the number the year
for birth

172
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,920
for better trivia her for checking BC on
Microsoft product that senate

authenticity holograms for products for
Windows 98

174
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,070
and since 1998 the British Computer
Society has awarded a medal in her name

00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,880
on June 16 2008 undergraduate Lovelace
colloquium

177
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,810
was held at the University of Leeds
which is becoming annual competition

178
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,690
for women students of Computer Science
that sponsored by the likes of Google

shell noble and IBM

180
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,020
Frances Elizabeth Snyder who after
marriage change your name to be home

181
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,640
in was the granddaughter of an
astronomer and replying

182
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,420
classical literature & language she was
left-handed cross-eyed and constantly

183
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,569
harassed by her classmates

184
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,900
even as the college when she began to
study math at the University of

185
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Pennsylvania her math professor said

186
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,730
she should be staying home raising
children instead of wasting her time to

187
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,730
achieve a degree

188
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,440
to survive in a man's world she decided
she was studied journalism

189
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,370
because it was one of the few programs a
study that was open to women her time

190
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,160
ill outer travel she got to see the
world she got to do things that she

191
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,010
enjoyed

192
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:59,390
because I for journalism background she
was hired by them or school as a

193
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:04,250
computer this letter to being chosen as
one the six women who for an eniac

194
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:08,030
although they were classified as sub
professionals they programmed

195
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:11,260
to perform calculations for ballistics
victories

196
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,980
after over two she worked at Remington
rans and the National Bureau of

197
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,300
Standards

198
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,770
she was the chief the programming
research branch applied mathematics

199
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,590
laboratory at the David Taylor

200
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,200
model basin in 1959

201
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,650
they believe that computers we don't
prosper if they were easy to program an

202
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,850
operator

203
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,670
but her most memorable quote from her
many notes was saying that she spent

204
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:36,680
half effort I'm trying to figure out
where people need a computer

205
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,990
the other half turn as an email engineer
was his idea so it would get done

206
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,160
she led the committee that developed the
standards for cobalt and Fortran

207
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,199
language is

208
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,390
and work in conjunction with grace
hopper she invented the mine

209
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:52,449
construction set called c10

210
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,000
and binary compete for the primary on a
Mac computer

211
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,080
BI NBC which grace hopper later called
the basis for all subsequent programming

212
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,960
languages in existence

213
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,640
she influenced the design fortunes have
higher if you know that as well as much

214
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,060
as the software

215
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,620
she was the one who decided they should
color grey instead of black

216
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,550
to conserve heat the suffrage she
designed for you that was delivered to

217
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,750
the US Census

218
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,770
bureau in March 1951 which was then uses

219
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:24,079
used to process the 1950 census results

220
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,130
she was responsible for the first
quarter and merge generator for you back

221
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,510
one

222
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,120
which leads the way for shoppers
compilers

223
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,340
in 1997 she received the Augusta a
lovely Soward

224
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,740
and was inducted into the Women's
technology international hollis same

225
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:45,300
along with other female eniac
programmers

226
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,950
rear admiral grace Murray hopper whom
the room next door is named for

227
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:52,090
was born grace brewster Marie in New
York City

228
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,040
because I for naval rank me one very few
women to make it to rear admiral

229
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:00,199
she was referred to as amazing grace she
was the third programmer at the Harvard

230
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,240
Mark one calculator

231
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,130
I say third because the first two were
males she made her the first female

232
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:07,140
programmer

233
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,620
she developed the first compiler for
computer in for computer programming

234
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,590
language COBOL with the aid of the
committee a programmers that worked with

235
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,680
her

236
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,570
in 1928 she graduated from Vassar
College with a BA in mathematics and

237
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,410
physics

238
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,050
and join their faculty while she
continued nah cities at Yale

239
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,050
where she earned a master's in 1930 and
a PhD in 1934

240
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:30,070
she was one of four women in her
doctoral program out of a total of 10

241
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,320
students

242
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,350
it was considered very rare for women at
that time to complete an entire

243
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,260
doctorate program

244
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,640
she was determined to join the military
ascension entered as soon as the world

245
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,030
entered World War two

246
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,270
those never served in a book on that
because at the age of 34

247
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,930
she was told she was too old and not
have enough for her height

248
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:51,270
to enlist however they said

249
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,220
her job as a mathematics professor was
considered essential to the war effort

250
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,970
and that she was to remain teaching at
Vassar College

251
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,300
the Harvard Mark one was the first
large-scale automatic digital computer

252
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,530
in the US

253
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:06,870

262
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,490
it was fully automatic me did not meet
any human intervention once it was

263
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,420
started

264
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,130
unit was fed by 24 channel punched paper
tape which were then processed

265
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:46,430
and read the next one that at this point
technology there was no such thing as a

266
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,950
traditional branch instruction

267
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:54,630
so any complex program was physically
humongous

268
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,260
this problem brought about the term look
which comes from the fact that the

269
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,090
operators would literally joined

270
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,450
both ends in a taped together so the
program will continue feedback in

271
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,190
automatically

272
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,780
and no one had to sit babysit

273
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,400
the term bug in reference to computers
is also attributed to grace

284
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
after her retirement from the Navy in
August 14 which with

285
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,360
1986 which was involuntary at the time
because once you try it you have to

286
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,300
retire

287
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,690
she was awarded the defense
Distinguished Service Medal true

celebration aboard the USS constitution

289

at that moment she was the oldest
officer in the navy aboard the

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,460
leadership in eighty

291
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,770
she was hired as a senior consultant at
Digital Equipment Corporation remain an

292
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,340
employee there until her death in 85

293
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,920
her position a DEC involved working as a
goodwill ambassador

294
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,240
lecturing in the early days of computers
her career and her efforts

295
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,200
so that computer vendors could make life
easier for users

administration Billy on the naval
support activity Annapolis

previously known as the naval station at
was is named the grace hopper building

298
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,920
in her honor

299
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,870
in addition I had a legal professor had
an office four doors down from where the

300
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,779
same building during her time in the
Navy

301
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:41,870
who told interesting stories about her
thinking outside the box

302
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,700
her most famous quotation that he could
get me was it easier for

303
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,910
ask for forgiveness than to get
permission

304
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,510
a ship in the harbor is safe but that's
not what ships are built for

305
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,640
I think I like her already

306

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,880
where she played a lot 100 on life as an
indifferent husband

460
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,660
during her role they showed many
close-ups of her face in a state of war

461
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,210
guess

462
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,100
long shots for a minute through the
woods which came the film its notoriety

463
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:30,320
strangely the expressions on your face
turn the film were not a direct result

464
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,059
there the resolve the director poking
her in the ass to safety pin

465
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,670
xicot invented an early form spread
spectrum which is the precursor to

466
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,840
modern wireless communications

467
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,179
together with George and sold the
vanguard composer and neighbor affirm

468
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:45,970
our

469
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,970
they experimented with automated control
instruments has submitted the idea

470
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,610
to a secret communications system in
June 1941

471
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,040
on August 11 1942 it received US Patent
Number 2

472
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,799
292 387 this early version a frequency
hopping

473
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:05,059
use a piano roll to change between
eighty different frequencies

474
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:09,450
was intended to make radio guy torpedoes
harder for an enemy to detect a jam

475
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,850
although the idea was slightly
impractical very had its time

476
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:16,920
and infeasible do the stated mechanical
technology in 1942

477
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,880
it was not implemented until 1962 was
used by US military ships

478
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,290
during a blockade of cuba after the
patent has expired

479
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:28,790
neither an till nor lamar made any money
from this invention mostly due to a lack

480
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,070
in development

481
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,500
in 1997 pfft for an award for
contribution

482
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,809
this frequency hopping idea became the
basis for modern spread spectrum

483
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,160
communications technologies

484
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,890
used in devices from cordless phones to
wifi to CDMA

485
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,100
she wanted to join the National
Inventors Council but was told should be

486
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,110
better off helping the world for using
her celebrity status to sell war bonds

487
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,330
her first is actually race seven million
dollars

488
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,639
in 1998 a vector diagram of her face was
used by Carell on the package if Carell

489
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:58,970
draw

490
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,230
8 her family's attorney Sutro for the
damages

491
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,799
unrelated to authorize cue serve her
likeness which was settled out of court

492
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,040
for an undisclosed sum in 1999 terms
that allowed Carell five years

493
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,928
exclusive rights to her image in 2003
Boeing registers ad featuring her as

494
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,990
the woman a science but no reference to
her film career was ever made

495
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,090
in 2005 the first inventor's day of
Germany's german-speaking countries was

496
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,220
held in her honor

497
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,299
November 9th which would have been her
92nd birthday

498
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:31,000
my favorite quote from her film career
is films have a certain place

499
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,130
and talk in certain time periods
technology is forever

500
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:42,600
how many people can tell me what the
woman in the pictures doing

501
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,520
here's a hint this pictures courtesy the
ATT archives

502
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,950
this is an operator delivering the time
live two collars in nineteen twenties

503
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,860
when the concert started

504
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,460
they were pay 45 cents an hour to sit in
a booth for six hour shifts and read the

505
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:55,950
time

506
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:00,710
every 15 seconds

507
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,370
according to AT&T is archives the time
as they called it

508
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,230
began in Chicago in 1928 were two
operators would sit in front of clocks

509
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,210
leave the time every 15 seconds

510
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,710
anyone who call people who were selected
to work

511
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,440
took their very jobs their jobs very
seriously and work all the time keepers

512
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,000
the telephone companies at that time 30
cutting edge service

513
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,309
sometime in the nineteen forties it
became automate recorded on the tape

514
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:27,620
played is needed

515
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,620
these time machines as they were called
large drums two feet in diameter

516
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,160
with as many as a hundred album like
audio tracks on the exterior

517
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,580
whenever someone call the drums would
turn messages begin playing

518
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,168
next with different tracks on the fly

519
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:46,480
in a state of California prefixes for
calling time with

520
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,650
767 and 853 no matter what four-digit
you dialed after that you would get the

521
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,640
time of day information service

522
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,929
so Northern California instituted an
advertising campaign to help callers

523
00:28:56,929 --> 00:28:58,220
remember

524
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,650
to get the time of day style popcorn

525
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,179
for decades people dial that furry
saying the CRC changing their watches

526
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,980
after daylight savings time

527
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,890
the last two remaining state that
utilize their California and Nevada

528
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,970
currently california was in your new
telephone numbers

529
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,140
so they're discontinuing service the
recycling numbers as a necessity

530
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,290
I feel bad for people who get anything
in those prefix sister phone's going to

531
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,490
ring off the hook

532
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,030
as a September 19th 2007 the service has
been discontinued and the bank customers

533
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,710
will be recycled starting October 2008

534
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,419
many other time ladies in a few the time
gentleman as they were called

535
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:39,760
came and went over the years in nineteen
fifty a woman named Mary Moore emerged

536
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,660
as the nation's leading Time Teller

537
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,900
Sheeran hours minutes and seconds in a
distinctive some say percy town

538

with I pronunciations she was succeeded
by Jean Barbie

539
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:54,250
as far as I know the service is still in
use for the US Naval Observatory in

540
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,910
washington

541

however when I try to verify the number

546
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,129
it was a recording from owning the
religious Save the Children donation

00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,160
I'm Jane Barbie and I talk to about 50
million people every day

632
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,470
many times I might tell him something
like have

633
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:13,869
at the tone the time will be 7

634
00:35:13,869 --> 00:35:17,670
45 can pick your anything good morning

635
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:22,090
this is your wakeup call we do automated
hotel wake-up call

636
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:26,260
nobody likes to get though as well as
they are a bit since I go but it's a

637
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,270
necessary evil we try to be as gentle
with them as we possibly

638
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:33,590
and it produces as you might imagine

639
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:37,830
a certain sort of Fame 7 45

640
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,180
people that know that this is what I do
well come up to me and say

641
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,839
said said button here he said

642
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,420
I always say it say it say it you know
so you might cocktail party and you feel

643
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,590
like a perfect idiot

644
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:57,090
and then when you do go I got I really
is you I talk to you all the time

645
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,540
it's logical in and illogical sort of
way

646
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,300
think of them as the two women who
personify the

647
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:08,080
d personalized message

648
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,279
at this point I like to take any
questions comments or concerns that you

649
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,820
may have

650
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,540
anyone West

651
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:24,540
I'm I don't know favorite is a computer
your favorite is the when the phone

652
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:31,490
I don't know personally I'm I like agent
because she

653
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,930
she started out with this

654
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,169
controlling has been ended up running
off from doing her own thing and she so

655
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,850
for thinking outside the box the box is
gone on the horizon

656
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:47,850
up

657
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,920
in

658
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,660
no I heard that they had not gotten a
copy of it yet every time I

659
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,890
gonna burns normally keep telling you
your order it for me yeah

660
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:15,370
now i cant see hands with the lights

661
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:19,009
think there's think there's no that's
akin to see

662
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:26,010
the you yet

663
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,600
I'm thinking the more we get I say
civilized

664
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,839
the more when I'm sayin technology when
I started college

665
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,110
in 2004 there were four women in the IT
department of 1200 students

666
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:49,280
when I graduated in May there was 22

667
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,000
it's not that many even increase but it
is two minutes to me a significant

668
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,410
number that we could change their mind
to go from a traditionally female career

669
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,310
into something that if they actually
interested

670
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,790
they can feel free to explore without
persecution I think that

671
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:05,960
a lot other previous younger generation

672
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,700
were still subject to the older
grandparents each

673
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,110
where women had to do certain things and
as the older generation

674
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,250
dies of ideas in your generation will no
longer be hindered by them

675
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:21,760
see ok I see waving hand

676
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,760
me

677
00:38:41,449 --> 00:38:45,299
fund 1n hats

678
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:50,829
times I know how you I know how you feel
when I said when I started college

679
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:56,390
that's the reason

680
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:59,749
when I started when I started college

681
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:04,369
I walked into an IT Helpdesk course
where the professor was a UNIX reject

682
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:07,249
from Pixar studios would never see when
does in his life was teaching Windows

683
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:07,890
Help Desk

684
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:12,690
I was the only woman in his class he got
to roll call got down on my knee looked

685
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:13,479
at me and said

686
00:39:13,479 --> 00:39:18,979
must be you after the second semester
had taken for

687
00:39:18,979 --> 00:39:23,789
the second part in the class the level 2
he was so frustrated that I turned him

688
00:39:23,789 --> 00:39:27,199
in for the of comment while I was in the
ladies room he thought I could hear me

689
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,150
as a women don't belong in technology

690
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,900
that they told him very politely either
you quit quietly or we fire you

691
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,839
I was proud of myself

692
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:45,839
I didn't appreciate his company up

693
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:52,339
okay low or

694
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:57,269
right you

695
00:39:57,269 --> 00:40:01,579
his well

696
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,130
UK

697
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:12,130
all

698
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,800
actually are answered this way on

699
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,210
I'm read a lot of genetic studies

700
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,700
my mother being a buyer and retired by a
teacher and there was a a

701
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,260
study was published about seven or eight
years ago

702
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:33,070
that they did genetic study the
difference between males and females

703
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:36,490
and they determine that women were more
analytical and they could determine

704
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,600
things like mathematics and science on a
level

705
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,810
that males could not that males were
better at hands on things

706
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:47,330
so women were technically more suited to
the mathematicians

707
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:50,500
or scientists or teachers because they
were very detail-oriented

708
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,550
I think as time goes on

709
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:59,740
despite that the said that perhaps more
that more so they could get into other

710
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,360
fields

711
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,630
at time to answer your why it was all
mathematics

712
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,710
that was one of the very few feels women
were allowed to be n

713
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,880
some colleges had a restriction when you
applied

714
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,820
as to what majors women were allowed to
be in and which ones they were not

715
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,980
so sometimes they didn't get a choice

716
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:23,980
was

717
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:30,250
trial

718
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,180
said nice

719
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:41,180
degrees

720
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,640
she published a paper on that

721
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,640
side basis for

722
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,530
I've read that study

723
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,470
like yeah

724
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:19,430
to

725
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:25,890
their go to use that via text books now

726
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,589
I am honored to meet you both

727
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,040

728
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,040

729
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:48,780
his almost

730
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,410
SX

731

you

732
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,380
there there's a certain aspect if he's
in the under pictures in the wind

733
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,250
yeah I see a hand flying in the back

734
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:17,250
hi

735
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:23,030
I'm really not the best person asked
that cuz I'm unemployed

736
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,620
I've applied to I kid you not I have
every rejection letter a hundred seventy

737
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,700
two different companies

738
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:32,900
cents February this year I have had 61
interviews

739
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,060
I have four second return interviews

740
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,600
and every one of those interviews turned
into your call for

741
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,080
we hired internally for a lesser
qualified no candidate that was an

742
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,130
internal candidate

743
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:49,260
I think it would be nice if they looked
at us

744
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,580
I'm status as a person as opposed to

745
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,779
whether we have boobs not or

746
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,780
on the state's a whether we have a quota
to fill a diversity quota

747
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,650
I'm a person just like you when I'm in a
job interview

748
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,780
if you have a cum pretend I'm a guy

749
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,290
if that makes you feel more comfortable
to the name at the top of the resume

750
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:11,670
just

751
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:17,930
pretend I'm a male candidate if anyone
is interested in hiring me I'm

752
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,609
take business cards and send your resume
if they have to the end to this

753
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:21,310
conference

754
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:25,090
anybody else so

755
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:32,090
fact house

756
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,500
just saw that one too

757
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,950
it

758
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:49,950
it turns into a nasty conflict and I'd
like to see

759
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:56,150
what they're going to do with it had I'd
like to see something nice come out of

760
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,410
it

761
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:01,040
whistle with not very much argument but
I do have to read more into that

762
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,360
yeah I know that's gonna turn in two
years and years and years argument which

763
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,800
is what I'm afraid of and that's going
at the point where they go

764
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,120
it must table it for a while I'm hoping
it

765
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:18,120
and pretty 11

766
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,940
the ACM has a division for the women in
technology

767
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,350
they do a monthly newsletter and mailing
and they hold a conference every year

768
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,020
and I've been to last two

769
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,130
them and I think it's fantastic that
there's a group and there's more than

770
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:35,530
one this is the only one I've had

771
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:38,890
personal experience with that will sit
down the entire conferences women

772
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,420
and companies that look for hiring women
and companies that need to sit down and

773
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:43,970
go through

774
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,840
a level sensitivity training where they
need to know how to hire women

775
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:53,360
or how to deal with women in the
workplace anybody else

776
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:00,360
I'm blinded by the light I welcome back
you

777
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,329
it depends on how fast people can let go
their whole idea while

778
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:09,689
ideology and come into the new Ste the
new ideology

779
00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:13,089
love there's no such thing as male or
female there's a person

780
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:18,859
when they were able to move beyond that
there'll be more women in technology to

781
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,949
be more women employed in the sciences

782
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:24,539
will be more research papers that are
openly published by women

783
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,549
sledge

784
00:46:28,549 --> 00:46:32,509

with

788
00:46:41,419 --> 00:46:45,288
the others from previous conventions
I've done related to the subject

789
00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:49,589
and there is a suggestion link with it
for comments and that will probably be

790
00:46:49,589 --> 00:46:50,959
up by Tuesday afternoon

791
00:46:50,959 --> 00:46:57,959

792
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,839
Lehigh Valley thank you lovely her

793
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:07,909
yes we are separate though we share one
is that

794
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:12,640
we r dot com there doesn't work I'm

795
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,150
so over there

796
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:20,559
welcome there'll be a section for
downloads

797
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,779
and in there will be three speeches this
one the previous incarnation ovett

798
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:28,749
and the original fear version that I
used

799
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:35,749
as a half an hour sorta fill-in I also
put the entire bibliography with that I

800
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,099
have a four page bibliography evolve my
research sources

801
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:44,349
you buddy I'm sorta running out of time

802
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:51,349
over 00 in the back okay

803
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:07,750
yeah

804
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:14,750
that's the problem it's surprising that
more than don't fight back against it

805
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,960
and say no I'm not leaving I'm going to
stay here

806
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,120
I have a really weird thought on that
one

807
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,089
that if that college that you're in
forces you out because you're female

808
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:39,020
they really didn't want in the first
place take your intelligence somewhere

809
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:40,759
else makes america's famous because

810
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,540
your their female student came up with
this magnificent theory that's published

811
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,660
everywhere and let the first college
certain sucker them about it

812
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:54,270
yes small-minded places like that

813
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,810
and I don't get along okay I'm

814
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,490
just at a time but I will be floating on
a conference of anyone else has

815
00:49:01,490 --> 00:49:05,000
comment question concerned something
known a woman they like to suggest

816
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,670
I'll be flying around you can't miss me
trust me and

817
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,600
thank you its
