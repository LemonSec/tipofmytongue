22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,300
we don't even know we're talking now

23
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,580
which is most the time I I've been
paying attention to this conference for

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,080
a while

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,679

here I really is my honor I feel like

26
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,300

room but being unqualified is my job so

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,640
I'm just gonna run with it I

28
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,770
what I have is about a 15-minute

29
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,459
maybe 10 minutes if I could talk really
fast piece on obsession discussing my

30
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,920
personal obsession is cuz I suspect that
there's some

31
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,600
minor obsessive compulsive tendencies in
the audience and then I'm going to take

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,859
questions from you gots

33
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,760
and just have a a conversation for
another 40 minutes alright some good

34
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,670
Pepe we'll see how fast I can run
through this thing

35
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,670
about four years ago the new yorker did
a piece on a cash

36
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,100
goto skeletons found on the island of
Mauritius number reaches a small island

37
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,060
off the west coast and Madagascar in
Indian Ocean where the total pervert

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,390
was found discovered and eventually
extinguished by human inhabitation

39
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:57,900
or rats whatever prevailing periods now
this article is about how

40
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,250
archaeologist we're excited to fight
this cash Skelton's because it meant

41
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,959
that they might actually be able to
assemble

42
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,549
a full daughter Stella for the first
time well museums all over the world

43
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:08,360
have different go to skeletons another

44
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,959
has a complete and whole skeleton from a
single total just don't know when

45
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,290
extinct such a recent I'm 1700 nobody
was actually

46
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,429
paying attention to extinction as the
tragedy we understand it is now

47
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,030
nobody save the boats the same all the
bones from a single go to everyone's had

48
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:24,680
to assemble

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,730
there's from many many different pieces
at this appeals to me

50
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,150
now I I have a particular obsession with
things

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,140
a peculiar type rarity things that
there's only one up in the world or

52
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,250
maybe there's no one even knows where
the one in the world

53
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,569
is lost manuscripts I the Necronomicon
from evil dead:

54
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,800
now yeah pie

55
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,150
tibet tibet clay seal tablet manuscripts
found in caves

56
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,170
%uh the aristotle's comedia from the
name

57
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:00,069
rose things like this feeling really get
me going to make me

58
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,959
for some reason it feeds right into my
love making objects

59
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,260
because the optics and I makeup course
one of a kind design one that made them

60
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,290
there's this like this direct parity
between object

61
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,609
this kind of rarity and I the thing that
really got my attention now

62
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,310
about this article about the total birds
was this photograph I could

63
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,000
at this photograph is so compelling to
me it was so beautiful this

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,220
there was so much personality in the
skillet

65
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,750
I could see that this isn't fast lines
it's real bone I could see

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,770
that the wire the concert reviews to
sample the skull

67
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,830
there around the peak there was so much
story

68
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,580
in this piece and gots that I wanted

69
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,690
now

70
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:48,139
I've more money now than I used to and
again looking around on the web this is

71
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:48,710
actually the

72
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,979
go to scaling on the island of Mauritius
in their tourism museum it's my favorite

73
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,190
and i'd get downloading pictures up go
to scouts from all over the web museums

74
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,150
all over the world

75
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,160
and I wanted to see if anyone sold a
replica of one I figured it was a long

76
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,790
time I did find this couple that makes
them for museums

77
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:09,620
they talked about 20,000 host PC I don't
have that much money

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:15,020
%uh but I did manage to gather several
hundred pictures into my creative

79
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,859
projects folder

80
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,470
I think a lot you have folders like this
it's called creative projects it really

81
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,240
is

82
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,890
full-out obsession probably 40 gigabytes
25,000 photos everything I'm interested

83
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,169
in

84
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:33,099
I brings decoder rings that break here
that's a pistol rank you guys publishing

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,800
this online disliking of STEC in the
same sites airplane cockpits people's

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,729
work benches

87
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:41,400
other cf1 by faster

88
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,070
and I'm gonna give up my geek red

89
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,070
I have drew this map Middle Earth for
myself by

90
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,039
so one day I met the art store and I'm a
bit maybe

91
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,410
about a month after I saw the the Johto
article I

92
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,210
made many your but I'm at the art store
and buying some specifics copy and some

93
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,210
stuff for my kids would have a crap day

94
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,210
at home we're gonna sit on kitchen table
and culture and

95
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,500
I got all these a these photos

96
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,229
but for some reason to ring it to my
head while I'm in the art store and I'm

97
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:15,680
thinking

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
you know I've looked at the daughter
still enough the Total spell enough that

99
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,669
I really understand its topology I think
I've got it in my head and maybe I

100
00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:26,010
maybe I could make it a todos cock

101
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,650
the thing should understand about me
know is that I'm not a sculptor II

102
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:34,400
have never been a traditional soft
sculpture in special effects I was what

103
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,550
you call hard edge mother fucker I can
make towers like this all day long

104
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,669
things from the money but destroyed New
York from AI

105
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,440
parts from terminator 3: at Bicentennial
man this kinda stuff

106
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,990
absolutely my belly with I love
hard-edged model making when it comes to

107
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,270
the saucer dragons faces I leave that to
the other guy some of my friends are the

108
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,770
most brilliant Scopus I've ever met it's
there

109
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,389
there task however I understood

110
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:01,840
the typology if this thing enough I
thought I could tackling and I found

111
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,660
this photo

112
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,080
which is ahead and with the skull which
gives me a size rafts

113
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,300
so I probably printed out and put I kept
on

114
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,780
expanding the size until the hand
matched my wife's hand actually

115
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,830
that looks like a lady's hand and then I
have a size preference for the skull and

116
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,550
I began

117
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,940
to gather all the rest the photos I had
print them up to an accurate scale

118
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:26,060
after about an hour to I had a
reasonable facsimile other

119
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,570
goto skull I wish I could show it to you
the problem is even though it occurred

120
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:31,320
to me at the moment

121
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,330
take pictures up the process of my first
quote sculpture

122
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:38,680
for some reason I was lazy night did not
take pictures however

123
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,909
after about an hour I had this total
skull and I

124
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:45,210
the the armature where I had going
around to the back a bit to hold the

125
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,750
skull

126
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,539
actually to be perfectly placed for a
vertebrae because skeletons is another

127
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:51,370
thing that I've been obsessed with over
the years

128
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,190
I have several dozen in my collection
and I you know if I'm in the woods and I

129
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,099
find some vertebrae and taken home

130
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,919
I understood vertebrae enough to
actually understand

131
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,400
to know their mechanical how they work
mechanically the different parts right

132
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
hon each other and I began to fake

133
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,549
myself a dodo spine I wasn't thinking
about making a full daughter at this

134
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,680
point it was kinda like

135
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,460
the only way you can clean a really
messy room I don't think I've ever seen

136
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:15,930
one

137
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:20,950
is in to just pick up one thing at a
time you don't have to think about the

138
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,639
whole thing just one thing at a time one
thing at a time but eventually the room

139
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,719
is clean I was just going for debris by
for to rate my vertebrae just thinking

140
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,849
about the next one and keep an ongoing
added some more wired cetera et cetera

141
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:30,539
until

142
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:33,740
by the end of that day I had a dodo
skull and is fine

143
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,360
and the better part the pelts so I kept
going iight

144
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,159
downloaded more pictures that go to
scouts more pictures /a at go to pieces

145
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,799
parts

146
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,820
a check this guy I found a guy trying to
ritual trucks from

147
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,770
Nate naturalist who visit in responding
does rely a whole total foot skeleton

148
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,020
this guy even put it on the scanner with
a ruler on it thank God for him

149
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,770
this guy too and so finally after about
six weeks

150
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,189
I made myself go to scallop by

151
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,190
notice I even went so far it's actually
make a museum label and I had tapped

152
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,520
plastics making a museum

153
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,050
the train for it I don't have the room
in my house for it yet there this

154
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,329
I at it it was deeply satisfying

155
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,060
and it also represented kinda the sea
change for me because

156
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:31,910
now that I had my goto all of a sudden

157
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:35,390
in my in my obsessions folder in my
creative projects folder there might be

158
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,100
something else I could make for myself
that I'd never considered to make for

159
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,410
myself because at that point when I was
first

160
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,829
obsessed with it I wasn't a sculptor and
so I went back to the creative projects

161
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:45,170
for

162
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,920
what else could I make and I set upon
The Maltese Falcon

163
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,819
never read the multi stock you have to
read it and if you've never seen the

164
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,010
movie a multi stop

165
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,620
you have to see it I know there's elvis
people in Beatles people in there

166
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,400
definitely have the people in Chandler
people and I am a raymond chandler

167
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,780
person through and through but I gotta
give it up for the Maltese Falcon

168
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:09,959
has fantastic book and an amazing movie
and it is specifically about

169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,790
the obsession with object the object of
desire

170
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,360
The Maltese Falcon that boger comes
across in the film that got minutes

171
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,110
looking for

172
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,950
now it supposedly a fourteenth century
gift from the Knights of Malta to the

173
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,300
Habsburg Kings is

174
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,030
thanks for giving them the the the
island of Malta during the fight with

175
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:28,480
the

176
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,930
Islamic empire in fact it's actually
based on quite similar thing this

177
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,770
hideous thing from the 16th century
which is called the NIP house a falcon

178
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:39,579
and it's actually a ceremonial pouring
vessel made kinda as an offering but not

179
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,650
by the Knights of Malta

180
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,670
although haven't built a lot of real
history into its history of the Maltese

181
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,240
Falcon

182
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,380
on I even went so far a few years ago to
buy

183
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,980
this replica of the band as I know it's
kinda dark but all you need to know is

184
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,140
that its peace crack

185
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,230
and there soon as I received it in the
mail they had taken photos have it that

186
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,030
made it look like it might be kinda
backer

187
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,459
when I got it just I mean it looks like
feels like peter falk in a falcon see

188
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:09,610
have I don't know whether the Delta came
from I N

189
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,730
the problem is I I saw it I knew there
was a piece a crap that sat on my shelf

190
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,500
I thought you know

191
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,890
I want the real thing and at that point
it didn't consider

192
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,900
making myself one I thought maybe I
could ask a friend Scott for me

193
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,900
and something like that I mean there's
certainly plenty of hideous replicas

194
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,130
on the web that people have made but I
wanted the real real thick

195
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,310
I want this and

196
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,620
this is a picture that I came across in
a very small thumbnail

197
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,380
I it turns out that the original maltese
falcon which was made in lead

198
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,660
I was given as a where do I begin

199
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,240
your river william conrad from the Canon
series in the seventh it's what we in

200
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,140
congress actually has a much longer
history with Hollywood he was kind of a

201
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,130
fixer kinda

202
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,230
cleaner director a writer and actor

203
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,850
he did a lot of work helping the city is
finished products that were unruly and

204
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,510
as a thank you to all service jack

205
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,520
morning gave him The Maltese Falcon and
it sat on his

206
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,490
office shelf for about 30 years tilly
died in this white sold at Christie's

207
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,570
I managed to track down an antiquarian
booksellers able to find the original

208
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,990
christie's auction catalog get me this
picture

209
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,660
which gives at tremendous amount a
beautiful

210
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,060
detail love up the Falcon and this
texter I mean

211
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,180
I'm still mystified by this text this
for

212
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,740
is casting let that it was painted with
black enamel for the movie

213
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,260
and after forty years of people handling
it for some reason its goal

214
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,819
I don't get it but I love it and that
that that the patina

215
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,850
the other thing one of the other areas
that are really fascinated by with

216
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,580
within the the subset objects is the
patina

217
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,870
that tells the story of

218
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,339
the narrative up the object in fact it's
every

219
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,080
every model maker will tell you when
you're working on a spaceship on star

220
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,790
wars in your

221
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,349
gluing two things then you taken a space
going another cousin star were sexually

222
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,550
to think space one thing at Star Trek
its three things in Iraq

223
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,300
and you're putting these details on
piece by piece and

224
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,820
you always have in your head the
narrative what these things are I

225
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,240
understand where this is a cooling vent
this is an offshoot thing this isn't

226
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,690
something else the thermostat

227
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,500
and that narrative informs the peace it
tells me that the piece is looking right

228
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,290
now it doesn't quite look as it doesn't
look like

229
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,880
you know this works here and the patina
of the Falcon here is

230
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,010
completely cell similar to me to that it
is a narrative function it tells the

231
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,780
story of the object other birds I found

232
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,069
online a that were in my obsession for
this one is actually a resident Maltese

233
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:38,530
Falcon

234
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,770
apparently built when humphrey bogart
cat pissed off cuz the let one was so

235
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,150
friggin

236
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,280
having a that he dropped it this is a
resin one founded in New Jersey flea

237
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,640
market back about that

238
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,770
10 or 11 years ago by and Los Angeles
filmmaker recognize it for what was it

239
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,460
from five years to authenticate which

240
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,110
I thought was kinda funny cuz looking at
I understood it was authentic the second

241
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,640
I saw

242
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,130
chasm a budget details and this actually
sold

243
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,160
Profiles in History around 1999 propose
in this reason other

244
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,870
movie memorabilia auction site and the
best thing that Profiles in History that

245
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,540
if you see there is that they not only
took a photo from the front but that

246
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,439
there were photos

247
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,480
up the both sides and the back and so
now

248
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,530
I had all the top logical details I
needed to really put the whole

249
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,870
entirety Maltese Falcon in my head and
start to make

250
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,290
so I probably printed all all these
photos up I know these are lower res but

251
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,500
they gave me what I need

252
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,520
I picked them up full-size because
likely christie's auction catalog I have

253
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,760
to interpret the exact

254
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,459
size and dimensions up the Falcon and I
began to use these with CalPERS and

255
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:42,760
sculpting the Super skopje my by Maltese
Falcon

256
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,700
now I only have what picture that I took
the show to a friend of mine that I took

257
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,600
with my

258
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,110
my my eyesight Cam'ron laptop here this
is me

259
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,480
my wife watching television and I'm
working on the Falcons slowly but surely

260
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,640
that

261
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,490
the other thing is I because it's at
this is only my second sculpture I don't

262
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,839
know how to make it shiny I don't really
know how to make it smooth I definitely

263
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,220
it turns out that I'm pretty good at
replicating a typology but I don't know

264
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,890
how to get all these correct extremes
but I do know how to cheat

265
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,180
the correct experts so I threw it into a
vat of rubber

266
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,370
let the rubber hard pulled out the
casting a made of resin casting of that

267
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,920
and

268
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,140
that when you wanna smooth an arrest
casting you can use body news auto

269
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,829
fillers you can use parties in there is
my preferred think

270
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:26,950
is a actually about 70 coats

271
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,470
this auto primer you just keep on spring

272
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,040
its fix like hell but there's nothing
that's easy to send and when you're done

273
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,439
hit with buncha quadruples are still
will any polish it

274
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,720
and I was it up I yet so as a polishing
this

275
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,190
casting you know I'm I'm trying to work
on the light takes a look at the in the

276
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:46,380
movie there's a scene when they've
revealed the fact that they actually

277
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,709
spend it

278
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:50,730
on camera really close so I did
screenshots

279
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,050
every frame but the fact is visible

280
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,450
to really weapon I really replicating
the like kicks I'm

281
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,070
replicating the lighting in the room in
taking a look at my piece as I'm sending

282
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,110
it as I'm

283
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,180
you know getting the different planes
down

284
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:12,180
until I had this and there's one of its
top

285
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,439
over we're not done by a long shot I'm
obsessive remember

286
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,680
so here I have this thing which i don't
realize from the

287
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,000
extensive amount research that i've done
my Google for

288
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,050
and my my arrogance tells me this is the
most accurate

289
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:35,439
replica multi stopped with anybody has
ever made up till now and I'm pretty

290
00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:38,519
satisfied with its Kat the shine it's
got all the like kicks

291
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,879
I has a lot of Moxie but its

292
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:47,899
not quite there because its it's too
like the real Maltese Falcon was

293
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:49,170
forty-one pouts

294
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,189
its let I wanna want me to let

295
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,750
so I took I figured let's start with
bronze

296
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,810
I i know i wanted to be let in will
eventually be led the whole story will

297
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,660
end with me having a let's start with
that

298
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,928
patina but in the meantime I want to
work with something it was a poisonous

299
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:09,409
in so I I had a wax master cast we had

300
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:14,150
gets put on it it turned out anybody
here ever familiar with the replica

301
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,130
props for

302
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:18,449
I'll come on rather the props for

303
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,230
is a group love really good peaks as
people like me collecting

304
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,880
trading information on and making their
own props from movies that they want map

305
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,110
for middle-earth stormtrooper costumes
everything

306
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:33,440
it's a level if you wouldn't believe how
much detail these guys can go into on

307
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,600
looks lightsaber from Star Wars and
whatever

308
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,929
my friend over but your friends on the
rpf that I bet over the years actually

309
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:41,669
many that I haven't met but only via

310
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:44,990
online we've traded stuff back for the
one in the managed to foundry

311
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,030
in northern california and he did all
this work for me taking my wax master

312
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,158
actually spring it with the plaster and
prepping it setting it up in his fortune

313
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,240
actually pouring it

314
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,230
in bronze here's the branch master just
coming out of the bowl

315
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:02,450
here to sitting at a skate Seaways but
27 and a half pounds

316
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,130
which is close enough it's actually
unbelievably happy when you go to pick

317
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,870
it up

318
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,620
a this is it after being sandblasted and
then I took it I I posted down I i

319
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,870
it was still will hit with much
polishing wheel student about the acid

320
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,419
overnight to really dark and down the
protein which I

321
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,880
know isn't quite the patina not quite
like the texture of the real Maltese

322
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,460
Falcon but

323
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,740
I get during this interim period I still
wanna objects that threw me in so I'm

324
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,190
still working with with materials I feel
with materials and processes that I feel

325
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,149
are authentic to the material up the
Falcons got funny

326
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:36,580
and a I don't know what these lights are
in there

327
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,860
a oh I see it's doubled up sorry about
that

328
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,659
and so that there it is there's might
there's my Prins Maltese Falcon

329
00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:48,549
and this thing yeah this one I really
think about

330
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,030
it is it is

331
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,059
its its whole areas when you go to pick
it up the the

332
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,879
Ranger peoples expressions when they go
to pick it up they the graphic it's

333
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,460
really cold they can tell that's heavy

334
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,610
and they start to move it and get the
situation like while the two and then

335
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,010
they try to tip it to lift it and that's
when they realize that it's actually

336
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,129
much heavier than they were prepared for

337
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,440
and that a good 20 percent people who

338
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,440
go near can even pick it up it's like
it's just it's heavier than anything

339
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,429
they handle in the normal course in
their daily lives

340
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:18,470
I but again with this one

341
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,570
they are and here's the progression
here's a here's the

342
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,770
on the leftist piece a crap about anyway
there's my super skopje Falcon there's

343
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,020
my first inner casting

344
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,230
there's my Polish one and there's my
bronze when I don't if you can see with

345
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,039
the problem there is but there is a big
problem which is

346
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,070
if you've ever Kassadin molded anything
especially big value metric objects like

347
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,320
it like a fountain like this

348
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,070
you lose a certain amount of size

349
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,210
between one and five percent in each
generation of casting

350
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,309
and so when I held up hi-res for my

351
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:51,840
ritual surface covered against the
Browns for the bronze first three

352
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,949
quarters when it's too short

353
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,840
at the peak which of course means I hate
it now

354
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,158
it's nothing but it's not a good interim
artist for

355
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,230
at this point so I think you're now I
have two options

356
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,630
I can either take the original casting
of my Polish blackbird

357
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:15,149
have laser scan have it iraq prototype
sometime deposition or 3d without the

358
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:16,720
process and then recast in both

359
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,809
ok by the way have cast up at 10 percent
to large that it's casting procedure

360
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:24,700
a progressed from there I'd end up with
the Bronx one up the correct size

361
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,059
and then I'd cast finally in lead or

362
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:31,610
I contact either doctor gary land the
dentist who bought one of the two lead

363
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,240
Falcons

364
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,040
or run when Stan the man who bought
William Conrad stop the run with syntax

365
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,080
is the son of Harry Winston the famous
jeweler

366
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,379
and run block William Conrad stopping at
christie's

367
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,210
and I met Ron last year I spoke at the
EG conference in Los Angeles and Ron

368
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,980
said you know next time you're in New
York give me a call I'm here in New York

369
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,760
run didn't return my call the strap

370
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,760
but what I'm hoping that I can convince
him or

371
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,820
at carry Milan to do

372
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,530
is let me visit the bird I'll sign a
piece of paper saying I'm only ever

373
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,600
gonna make one

374
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,399
but I have a portable handheld laser
scanners it's in the city

375
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:10,040
the

376
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,260
I think I see where I'm going with this
forever

377
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,190
prototype haven't cast in bronze make it
slightly to watch the successor process

378
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,270
I end up with the right hand

379
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,250
with the right one and then I and all
happy to give them one till

380
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,909
I end up with my maltese falcon decked
out in let

381
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:29,030
and then I can figure out exactly how to
do that goal process that that that

382
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:29,840
patina

383
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,449
that'll take me another six months check
back to be in the year to tell you how

384
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:39,450
to do it

385
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,669
guys go to the Senate session like that
it now

386
00:21:46,669 --> 00:21:49,950
alright I I'm having questions

387
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,100
from the audits for the remainder of my
time appear II soo how many people here

388
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,940
have ever

389
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,659
we get the lights upon the crowd how
many people you have ever yelled at me

390
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,070
at the television

391
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,678
yeah prices this is that's the largest
percentage I've ever see

392
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,260
now even at engineering schools it's not
that large

393
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,250
to get the lights upon the idea to look
to see everybody

394
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:20,360
with that

395
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,630
ok so apparently there's a microphone

396
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:31,630
very go there this K

397
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:33,550
the

398
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:40,100
bro

399
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,380
cost

400
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:50,380
I I love techno

401
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,429
okay you no 01

402
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:55,450
no one hears gonna sue you for telling
me that I miss that starting at

403
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,260
no one here is gonna sue you for talking
about this

404
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,850
so I've been curious sits around
9/11/2001

405
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:08,500
why you haven't built a scale model
World Trade Center

406
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,190
with all the i-beams and everything and
let's see what

407
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,669
actually would happen yeah in

408
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:21,610
by have you could serious convo

409
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,490
if you just hit it with the plane and
there was a fire over when you're the

410
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,539
top

411
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:30,679
if but the whole they would fall down
%uh its

412
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:36,260
its its its on our list it's been on our
list for a long time up

413
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,620
and at one of the problems is figuring
out a scaler

414
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,140
budget to do it in that is possible
within the confines of our show we have

415
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,950
turned around

416
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,340
amid and seven dates and that seven days
to

417
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,139
you know thats seven days to build a
60-foot suspension bridge

418
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,190
seven days to train a goldfish one's
easy one becomes really hard and

419
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:58,370
especially when you're scaling

420
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:01,789
the engineering problems like the
60-foot suspension bridge probably

421
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:05,080
I consider one of our worst moments on
the trail I

422
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,220
engineering it's really difficult to
scale materials

423
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,399
especially to up degree that's actually
satisfying people

424
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:14,570
and I wouldn't go near that one unless I
was convinced we could do it in a way

425
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,960
that was actually convincing

426
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,270
to I don't wanna practice at the people
that

427
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:22,490
for I don't wanna preach to the choir I

428
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:25,700
wanna do it in a reasonable scaling
reasonable size it is on our list

429
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,730
it is something we've been thinking
about it's right up there with the

430
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:35,730
dick cheney shooting in

431
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,800
so so that actually sorta

432
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,600
was stealing my question but not really
its can you give an example of something

433
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,230
that you guys

434
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:51,020
get in and you say wow that's really
cool but it is so not for Discovery

435
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,470
Channel

436
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,480
I yeah it's funny

437
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,910
did that's a common question the what it
what is Discovery Channel turned down

438
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:02,070
a were often surprise they

439
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,550
they'd let us do most the racy things we
wanted to do

440
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:09,919
like gun the Civil War soldier getting
shot testicle impregnating a lady today

441
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,730
I it took a couple love years for us to
convince them that we could do that

442
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,270
tastefully but we did

443
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,550
I right now we're doing a idiom

444
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,280
special and I was able to convince in
the model making industry

445
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,879
you're off from work for art directors
who were idiots and

446
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,220
at I don't the shocking on Sat and

447
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,340
I when you're working on a model for an
art director is an idiot the design is

448
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,990
terrible but you still gotta make it
look good for the film we call it hurt

449
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,500
polish

450
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,940
think I the and I thought that's great
why can't let's do polishing a turd is

451
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,900
that possible so

452
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,970
we were we were actually got all the
poet from the service QoS

453
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,610
to just on %uh the only the only
restriction is that we can't take

454
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:55,020
heard for some reason discovers that is
a practices requires that we say

455
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,320
do do or poop poop quit despite its it's
funnier

456
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,909
a the want to discover into turning down
the turn out not to be

457
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,540
discovery are the ones which they can
stick they have a hard time seeing how

458
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,020
we could do in an interesting way

459
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:13,129
I I've been wanting to do Monster Cable
versus

460
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,860
coat hanger the yeah

461
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,040
really bored 3 around the CDC

462
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,550
and trippy reducing boxes that you plug
in that make your stereo sound better

463
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,950
all that crap the hype I have a whole
high fidelity our that I've written

464
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,680
the discover keeps on saying this that's
not visual it's not it's tube or

465
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,580
I we have a whole episode called the
surreal gourmet

466
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,439
which actually discovered stole the
finale from for roadshow

467
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,150
up but this surreal gourmet was all the
different ways to cook food in

468
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:48,670
non-standard wayside putting fish in a
dishwasher cooking eggs and catalytic

469
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,350
converter

470
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:52,720
I various ways stick safely cook any

471
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,850
roadkill finishing off with tenderizing
me with dynamite would discover so that

472
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,490
we actually tenderized with dynamite

473
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:02,170
I late last year that will air this fall
if it hasn't already

474
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,400
has 10 resume without a mitred now okay
now

475
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,880
it see its yeah they've been saving a
ton of our episode stare starting next

476
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,100
week we're heard the Shark Week

477
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,350
airs next week and then it's like three
and a half months a brand new

478
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,630
Mythbusters episodes

479
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:21,480
all my yeah starting out with five yeah

480
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,490
pricing taking on the myth that the nasa
moon landing was a hoax

481
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,850
I besides the train

482
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,190
besides the cheney shooting which was
the only time I was told now and please

483
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:32,950
don't make that

484
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:38,550
suggestion again com discovery has
stayed away from things to do

485
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:42,550
we we did jumping on a grenade which if
the site is it

486
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:46,379
terrible terrible episode because they
had they turned it into a Hollywood

487
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,780
movie myth that people jump on grenades
and the the progression was is that

488
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,889
we did a bit about jumping on grenades
we did it beautifully succinct Lee we

489
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:55,190
had

490
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:58,820
we put bodies on week with helmets on we
put armor we put him in refrigerators

491
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,659
and we had all these cutouts and plywood
it at various distances from the kill

492
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,450
zone proved

493
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,900
exact the kill zone over Razak thought
it was I

494
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,010
except are so are cutouts were all World
War One soldiers

495
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:13,180
with the that rubble one helmet and it
was going to air

496
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:19,460
that day before that 2000 the day after
the 2004 election and discovery felt

497
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,260
that because the Iraq war that it was
too that would it be

498
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,100
put them in way to politicize the
position for us to be showing sold

499
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,550
talking about soldiers dying

500
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,899
and they said it would be disrespectful
the soldiers which I first thought was

501
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,180
most asinine thing I've ever heard in my
life

502
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,190
and we fought we thought we fought
bitterly with them there was actually a

503
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,730
lot of really angry emails going back
for Jamie's on the sensor really angry

504
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,780
emails to discovery

505
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:46,270
I to take that I I did anyone read Steve
Martin's biography but John Belushi had

506
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,180
this great thing to be told Steve Martin
for service at our lives that I only

507
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,580
yell

508
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,310
executives never the staff Gemini do the
same thing we do a lot to yelling at the

509
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,929
executives

510
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,460
I and in the end theory cut it as a
Hollywood

511
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,460
as a Hollywood myth and what we get we
get tons

512
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,920
a excoriating emails from soldiers
saying we disrespect

513
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,160
and I mean we for those right after
discovering said

514
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,670
in thank you very much

515
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,890
that some senior have to say

516
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:21,120
as a microbiologist please revisit food
on the floor for five seconds

517
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,280
really yet too numerous to count is like
measuring 480 with a 120 volt

518
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:33,230
ok gainer I but I don't think we've come
up with any different results

519
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,810
here's a here's the thing I don't think
you would either but I have a way to

520
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,909
test it okay

521
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,680
but the thing is is that we we will we
will absolutely revisit when we think we

522
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,580
screwed up the results

523
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,389
it's funny we'll revisit when we screwed
up we will stand by our results

524
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,860
Chris now we don't live in the UK

525
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,340
with the data set up one and two and
five but we do said by our methodologies

526
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,130
and I agree some other methodologies

527
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,760
get problematic but if we're gonna come
to the same conclusion is not there's

528
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,340
just not the me to do a revisit for

529
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,360
even though I I love five seconds or an
all-time favorites I'm

530
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,780
my kids now the drug can be on the floor
to look at them they're like okay

531
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,139
now expressed it

532
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,460
%uh gonna say first arm thank you for
making a small malls movies

533
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,610
I have to say I've always enjoyed
watching small models movies for

534
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:25,720
managers because it just looks a lot
more realistic to me

535
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,230
CGI no matter how good he gets just does
not get that realistic great you get

536
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:37,230
from actual photo hunting I project

537
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,880
and a second for the Maltese Falcon as a
comic book reference maybe wanna put a

538
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,780
stamp saying made in the Savage Land

539
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,250
on the bottom %ah

540
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,970
I and last I was wanting do you guys
plan on ever doing any episodes about

541
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,470
debunking crackpot ideas maybe like

542
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,050
the grisly soon for healing yourself
with the microwaves like

543
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:03,610
not say so's crackpot but he's a little
bit yeah

544
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:08,020
fits its every I was that the ET
conference and somebody came up to me

545
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,889
and said

546
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,970
you got your are you familiar with the
actually he didn't sound crazy when he

547
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,120
walked up

548
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,230
cassette are you familiar with the with
the

549
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,120
with the work I've nikolai Tesla and
this phrase flashed through my brain and

550
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,440
I almost said

551
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,280
do you mean nikolai test the genius
invented AC power or nikola Tesla the

552
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,300
total nutjob

553
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,570
by cuz there are two and there's two
kinds of people who love te so they're

554
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,490
gonna come up and talk to you in the
total nutjob step

555
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,500
the problem with the crackpot ideas is

556
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,580
often it's so difficult its its it's
very close to pick foot in crop circles

557
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,860
it's very close to your gonna end up
trying to prove a negative which is just

558
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,150
bad territory to be inside typically

559
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,130
I'm the the and we learned this when we
started doing free energy

560
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:55,770
we put our researchers on on on over
unity

561
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:59,950
and keep up with the research father was
like to fix it

562
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,180
inside uva inside about three weeks

563
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:07,260
and we have no idea where to even begin
a producer came up with a great idea

564
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,460
look what we can do is hope we can do is
start with

565
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,140
what people claim is going to work and
we got hits we've got kids

566
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,590
people said we're going to work and then
we built those and while I'm not

567
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,510
extremely

568
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,730
satisfied what we did on free energy
that's about as close as you can get to

569
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,010
that kinda stuff to try and show

570
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,230
somebody's guaranteeing you a positive
you can show that it doesn't work

571
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:31,480
because you've done the best faith
effort to make it work

572
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,510
with the crackpot stuff it's it gets a
lot more difficult

573
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,360
thank you very much for

574
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,770
and by the way with the CG versus models
while I totally

575
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,240
agreed to remember that there's a whole
buncha people out there spent

576
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,480
you know 25 years building models and
you seeing the results of all their work

577
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,280
whereas

578
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,800
the whole CG industry isn't 25 years old
yes

579
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,210
and I really do see because I have a lot
of friends and as for like magic that

580
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,280
move for models

581
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,750
into building virtual models that the
quality of model making that's coming

582
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,640
out in the virtual

583
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,870
world is increasing rapidly as people
get past the learning curve and

584
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,930
I mean of course we all know that the
Robert the where the rep respond to meet

585
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,610
the road next 10 years both in

586
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:17,140
CG and in rapid prototyping is in the
interfaces in people's ability to really

587
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,570
feel like they're interfacing

588
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,700
with the virtual object and when that
gets all but I think it's actually going

589
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,360
to get a lot better

590
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,050
by first about your bronze Falcon I know
it's pretty formal but I'd be willing to

591
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,050
take it away from you

592
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,139
I

593
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:37,630
I and then also I'm in industrial design
student a lot a model making

594
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,540
everything by hand essentially but I
have a lot of friends were interested in

595
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,690
making that transition from industrial
design

596
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:47,650
into special effects and wondering how
you sick just getting started in that

597
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,380
I yeah I that I got into special fax

598
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,870
in Jamie Hyneman actually on this bus
was hired me in 2000

599
00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:00,210
for to work in commercials and they work
for him and for couple toy companies for

600
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,540
about five years

601
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,100
and I got into industrial like magic
just at the tail end about the South one

602
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,970
and I have to say at this point its and
era whose time has

603
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:13,220
almost passed it's a real sad things but
model making

604
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,320
a lot of my friends and I thought a you
know that'd you might not

605
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,650
that's right medics shut down the mall
shop last few

606
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:24,200
they sold it to one of the old one other
all-island places to run about some Mark

607
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,580
Anderson and that's called Kerner
optical to Hobart to my friends

608
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,929
they are they have a sweetheart deal
lyle & they've got some great office

609
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:34,469
space they bought all the tools that
what the laser cutters and all of that

610
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:38,899
up but its it's much more catch as catch
can work

611
00:34:38,899 --> 00:34:42,759
and you know that original place I
leverage you know they would give us so

612
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,720
much money to build the models and so
much time

613
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,810
I had friends went from I'll ever down
the LA

614
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:52,190
and that's the LA that say you got three
weeks to build this model and they

615
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,168
work for an after two weeks as well
that's good enough for sure that

616
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:59,549
and they would get a chance to finish it
because the quality didn't want that

617
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,420
amount of quality

618
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,820
and so that that whole era a

619
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,310
it's edited whether workshop that's the
last place I think it is right now

620
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:12,940
sit down in New Zealand thank you

621
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,520
at sorry let me do when we're finished
to that question I will say

622
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,660
that all the special effects artist
since that I work with either whether

623
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,109
they were

624
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,200
higher or CG or actual practical model
making

625
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,090
were real poly mats and this is
absolutely worth it applies to a crowd

626
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,670
like this because

627
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,130
there's the aesthetic that want to learn
about one thing you wanna learn about

628
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,240
more things and I know

629
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,470
you guys more than almost any other
crowded probably ever spoken

630
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:38,920
to is a group of people who wants to
learn a little bit about absolutely

631
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,040
fucking everything you care

632
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,950
by

633
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:52,109
as a collector of skills and a master
I've not a single one of them

634
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:56,450
I there you know they did no one knows
the full phrase jack of all trades

635
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,620
master of none

636
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:04,569
the finish of that phrase is though
often better than a master of one

637
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:08,730
itself that special effects technician
said I've ever worked with their always

638
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,790
the ones who understand the big picture
where their model fits and how it all

639
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,990
goes together and

640
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,430
that will make you the moment I see
someone around me who understands

641
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:20,500
big picture even if they don't know how
to build stuff I know that I can teach

642
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,320
them anything

643
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,460
yep to put things

644
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,770
was ok I was like I'm a part hereof
first divide this was a

645
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,009
once again it's a very very very on a
free to be here

646
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,820
hope because you going out there and

647
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,210
being so passionate about something you
know you don't have to do it that you're

648
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,980
willing to learn skills that you don't
even know that you had before and only

649
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,280
getting the final result

650
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,840
the final result ends up being your own
I think that is the true essence at the

651
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,830
hacker spirits

652
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:54,830
my turn you are the hackers fair is a
great honor for me to clean

653
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,390
my second thing is that there is a
response be to people on this

654
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,569
line my that's for now to lose probably
one of the biggest fans have your show

655
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,330
he could afford to make it and he's also
paralyzed from the waist down

656
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,860
so it would be really how do we all
menus really upset they could come

657
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:17,210
as it is to combine from leader and his
was that if you just say

658
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,590
on on the stock that his names out will
be there outs robie

659
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:25,700
iraq it would you pick die happy but say
his name again slowly

660
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,320
Alex role be Alex Rogan yet Alex Rogan

661
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,500
iran oil wait like outs ropey role

662
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,560
row be roping your okay so

663
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Alex roving you rock thank the

664
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,830
a from the from the first day your show
aired

665
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:54,549
I was struck by the fact a you gays have
succeeded in

666
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,590
making science exciting not just for
adults

667
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:02,560
you know when we were in schools among
us it wasn't cool too

668
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,480
love science you made a really cool and

669
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,700
one of the things that you do it
beginning and

670
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,590
in middle your shows issue warned
viewers

671
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:17,950
you know please don't try this at home
give us a break and

672
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,190
I'd like to suggests that you consider

673
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,190
as you know a little piece in every show

674
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,260
where you give young people something
that they can do

675
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,770
that's safe a because there really
shouldn't be doing stuff

676
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,900
day you know ingress the show but maybe
a little something that they can do to

677
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,460
test

678
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,690
up the second thing I'd like to to do is
to say

679
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:45,010
if you're ever in Washington DC yes a
visiting the

680
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,350
headquarters for discovery in Silver
Spring a the mother ship this week I'll

681
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:54,240
yes would love you to come down to hack
DC and let us help people stuff up

682
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,240
hurt

683
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:04,880
I'll say this about coming up with
things that kids can try at home

684
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,460
I its its if we had started out wanting
to do a show

685
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,650
that inspired kids we would have never
succeeded

686
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,910
but the fact is I think that one of the
things that gets people involved

687
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:22,279
is that a lot what we're doing is taint
sorus

688
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,710
and shouldn't be tried unless there's
EMT is standing by and

689
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,790
the FBI bomb squad I but there is
something that we are

690
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,779
that where I mean it almost sounds like
a truck to trot out but it really is

691
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,579
true when I say the least environment
that altogether really mean that

692
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,160
Jamie and I are act along with Dan tap
star executives in Australia and art

693
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,160
director alice talent for a bus

694
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,098
I as a quartet really shaped stories
from the beginning and all the way

695
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,480
through to the end we really ship
stories about how their took its toll

696
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,690
and that methodology of critical
thinking is the thing

697
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,869
that we're hoping to imbue every step we
take a

698
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:03,950
we make sure it fits into the previous
step as best we can

699
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,970
the tells the story of discovery even if
we think we understand what's going to

700
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,440
happen

701
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,250
we start with the simplest possible
explanation and work up to the complex

702
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,540
explanation because

703
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,369
that story is something we want to end
views viewers with were tricking people

704
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:18,569
into watching

705
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:21,950
were tricking people into thinking
scientifically by blowing shit up

706
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:25,170
and then that is nobody's ever

707
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:28,200
release emailed us to thank us for our
groundbreaking work in urban legend

708
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,470
research nobody cares about

709
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,440
real everyone understands is a tacit
understanding if you really think about

710
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:33,890
that

711
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:36,960
this is just a scarecrow on which to
hang up

712
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,250
hanger show about science and about
actually explore

713
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,000
and that's that's that's something we
take really seriously everytime

714
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,910
and when we try and think about expert
we get asked a lot about experiments you

715
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,799
could do the kids

716
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:51,900
to and at Fort Lee so many the bar soap

717
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,839
often get really boring like mentors and
sewed up I'm really bored

718
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,980
metals and soda I at others

719
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,650
are nobody will allow you to do in
schools in the morning mister wizard was

720
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,549
able to like take hydrogen and Pringles

721
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:07,619
blow shit up in the classroom nobody's
allowed to do that anymore

722
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:10,630
so that's actually really it's a tall
order to fill and I don't think we'll be

723
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,670
trying to fill it anytime soon because

724
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,829
its again we're not trying to appeal to
kids that's just a

725
00:41:16,829 --> 00:41:20,339
wonderful wonderful side benefit that
week figures long as we go along way we

726
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:20,720
are

727
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,539
I'll keep on well

728
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:28,089
I meant no I'm when I was in high school
I did get to like the chalkboard on fire

729
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:29,328
and that was a lot of fun

730
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:33,289
what I wanted to say was ever since I

731
00:41:33,289 --> 00:41:37,809
side the first episode is your show I've
been telling people that might dream job

732
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:39,269
would be to work from Mythbusters

733
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:42,890
said what could I possibly do to make
that happen I

734
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:47,200
here script for never got that request
before

735
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,390
%uh up

736
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,140
at this point we r the turnover on its
crew is extremely small

737
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,269
as you can expect I and if opportunities
to come up

738
00:41:59,269 --> 00:42:02,690
they'll usually make a big deal either
shop on the Discovery message sports

739
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:07,009
or on the Mythbusters 10 aborts and will
do some kind of show about that

740
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:10,019
the sites that is not like tell you
thanks

741
00:42:10,019 --> 00:42:14,529
me Adam

742
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:19,640
and passed our strict here II enjoy your
show we close with like for

743
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,769
I'm sorry past are stuck here for your
show

744
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:25,910
when I love your motto I rack

745
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:29,129
often use it at the school I work at so

746
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:35,849
I'll have you ever thought of doing some
unease video game

747
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:40,609
out tonight miss but oh yes the stuff
they do in the video games like

748
00:42:40,609 --> 00:42:44,750
Team Fortress 2 while there guys can do
a rocket John

749
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:50,109
the morning though profit for 30 jump up
to help for Busters printer so much

750
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,109
but thats actually that had occurred to
us that's a good one

751
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,460
I he have one on our list for a long
time

752
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,740
that's that's just location dependent
called Nintendo versus pro

753
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:07,200
in which we take up a teenager who's
just got this driver's license but is

754
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,509
really good

755
00:43:08,509 --> 00:43:14,019
a specific driving game and putting him

756
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:18,369
on the Sears Point Raceway track in the
car he's good at driving on the

757
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,990
other in the gay because they know that
the physics simulators on them are

758
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:26,319
fantastic and seeing how well he does
against another teenager

759
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,808
similar skill level is also just got
this and see if that

760
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:33,210
trade you can actually keep to see you
better thriving embrace him off against

761
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:34,130
a real race truck

762
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:38,160
race car driver that's that's that's we
haven't done that yet it's just it's

763
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,220
been on the list forever

764
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,680
know it's a nice quick to be a story
problem is it pic spreading the track

765
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,529
which is just a

766
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:47,309
it's expensive and it hasn't happened
yet but it will I'd also like to thank

767
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:47,769
you

768
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:50,880
for coming it's and maybe even cooler at
my school next

769
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,809
I miss that I said I'd also like to
thank you for coming it's just

770
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:59,259
I'm whether the tickets going well be
kids they don't consider me a teacher

771
00:43:59,259 --> 00:44:00,960
now you can make me even cooler

772
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,960
hey Adam

773
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,809
I'll first quick question was your
weekly budget for fire extinguishers on

774
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,150
the fact that the

775
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,579
well its its you know the fire
extinguisher problem is an ongoing one

776
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:20,049
because

777
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:24,450
it's so much fun fire the co2 fire
extinguisher and

778
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,660
jamie is always getting really pissed
off about were

779
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,828
where's the or so taught them fire
extinguisher skin

780
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:35,890
this could somebody can somebody please
get sick got

781
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,210
damn it was

782
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,460
constant ongoing I'll few questions back

783
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,630
%uh

784
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:51,630
for

785
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,740
earlier you're talking about to no
nobody's

786
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:58,810
missing your groundbreaking work in
urban legends and I'm I think there is a

787
00:44:58,810 --> 00:44:59,520
certain level

788
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,150
love consumer you know

789
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,690
consumer advocacy and testing things for
yourself

790
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,160
not assuming that the manufacturer is
correct I'll

791
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,180
1i we should revisit more is RFID

792
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,450
now I know that just carry still have
the problem taking our

793
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:20,000
do the RFID thing yeah why did you not

794
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,250
I'm sorry I'm not there its it's just
it's not gonna happen

795
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,840
II to discover here's what happened
years

796
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,960
here's what happened not sure how much
the store have allowed to tell but

797
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,510
I'll tell you what I know in

798
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,720
the

799
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,280
River we're going to do our fighting

800
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,349
and on several levels

801
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:45,460
you know how hackable how reliable had
track

802
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:50,140
cetera et cetera and we a whenever
researchers call the Texas Instruments

803
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,650
and they arrange conference call between

804
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:59,619
I I think Tory and had producer over
there for the other team would welcome

805
00:45:59,619 --> 00:45:59,910
it

806
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:04,009
and I wanna technicians Texas
Instruments this was the first time Cox

807
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:05,500
called talk about technology

808
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:08,530
unlike Tuesday at 10 a.m. Tuesday 10
a.m.

809
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:12,109
with the Tory get on the phone and the
up

810
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:16,828
Texas experts comes on I along with
chief legal counsel for American Express

811
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:17,780
Visa

812
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,809
discover in and

813
00:46:21,809 --> 00:46:27,800
everybody else I mean and I get chills
just as I described it they were

814
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,890
wei-wei outgun and say

815
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:34,930
absolutely made it really clear to
discover that they were not going

816
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:39,259
to air this episode talking about how
happy with the stuff was discovered

817
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,270
back way down being a large corporation
it depends upon the revenue

818
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:48,380
the appetizers and thats son discovers
radar they won't let us go near it so

819
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,170
I'm sorry no we r its it's just one of
those things but man that was a

820
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:58,020
really story still gets little white he
describes that phone comes in

821
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,079
well you do have about 3,000 people in
the room who are

822
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,420
under such legal arrangement spy

823
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:11,380
I okay we'll

824
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:17,079
um I fight great to have you here and
and I've been a fan since the the first

825
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:18,690
episode so it's wonderful

826
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:22,839
arm I since you mentioned earlier about
all the food

827
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,190
I test that you interested in doing in
that discovery wasn't interested

828
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:31,089
how do you feel about the fact that on
the I'm also a foodie besides

829
00:47:31,089 --> 00:47:35,200
Mythbusters on the Food Network they're
actually starting

830
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,660
something similar to a Mythbusters show

831
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,848
starring Ted Allen yeah and how do you
feel about that

832
00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:46,549
I love it really absolutely I love it I
mean at

833
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:51,220
of course it's its it's incumbent upon
the other networks

834
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,380
Food Network and Tru TV to to try and
replicate success

835
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,480
Mythbusters I'm it's still one of the
top-rated shows on cable television

836
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,400
right now when it airs new episodes

837
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,210
I you've got smashed labs on Discovery
Channel you've got

838
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:08,480
sports yeah I know

839
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,560
what you've got sport science on ESPN
it's actually pretty good

840
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:18,049
you've got to there's a time-lapse show
on Discovery

841
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,310
its all time lapse photography that's
all absolutely of what we've done

842
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:24,900
we actually were were were prohibited
from doing

843
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:28,290
up for now we have an episode recently
because this country as a whole show

844
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:29,080
based on

845
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,540
the switch I can't tell you the idea
exits they're still in development but

846
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,460
I'm tons of things that we're doing are
being pulled out and and put together as

847
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:39,900
shows about figuring out the science
behind something taken close look at it

848
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,220
and

849
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,250
as much as I love being at the top of
the heap

850
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,950
and Mythbusters still riding on its the
crest at this way

851
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:51,390
I if there are more shows out there that
lend people who do critical thinking and

852
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,650
break something down and think about it
like that

853
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,080
that's fantastic i'd happy to watch s

854
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:01,700
lose to another show that did it better
I know that we don't do it as well as we

855
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,020
could

856
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,970
every single time although we try and I
know that a lot of the attempts out

857
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:06,600
there are

858
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,900
crappy as hell object the fact that our
people are trying to replicate our

859
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,480
success by making sideshows

860
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,480
is absolute about

861
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:25,150
free product from me New York point of
view as a possible

862
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,830
a science %uh suggestion i happened be
at home right now

863
00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:33,279
cut cutting up ceramic to on clay
ceramic tile to put my

864
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,250
Arvin it to make a better pizza better
pizza

865
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,630
and there's always obviously current
commercial

866
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,520
pizza stone and I was wondering if you
ever thought about

867
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,780
testing commercial stones verses you
know

868
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:50,860
this kind of you know unglazed which is
better

869
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,070
how to make a better all been yeah
bettors

870
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:57,900
you know better pizza and in particular
in the apollo computer from me

871
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:01,650
New York kind of pizza yeah and getting
a better

872
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,520
crossed and this is a new york issue I

873
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,650
you know cuz we're all going to having
this good thin crust

874
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:11,470
keep because if you never thought you
could put original raise right on the

875
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:11,720
other

876
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,450
yeah yeah this is a new york thing and
if we always have the chance of getting

877
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,410
the oven hot enough

878
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,970
you get to blow up a meltdown yeah for
up

879
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,570
you know there's a show on the Food
Network in

880
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,730
fact are you up the product testing
stuff is

881
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,810
its territory which we've drifted into
before we did

882
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:35,470
we have had one episode completely
coiffed by

883
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:39,740
advertising concerns and that was we did
a whole episode on teeth whiteners

884
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,870
a and we proved that they didn't do

885
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:47,359
squawk the the commercial once neither
prospect compare that to the process

886
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,840
that your dentist as protected as

887
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,470
something and we show that none of the
match up to the claims they made on the

888
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,120
boxes

889
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:57,390
and it spent six months with the
discovery players and they had

890
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,830
way too many colgate all those guys I

891
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:04,970
say even though we didn't name any other
products they wouldn't they

892
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:08,590
the discovery clever put that episode on
the ball I won't let us show

893
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:11,820
so that kinda stuff to comparing the
commercial product is something we could

894
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:12,130
do

895
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:16,110
we have to do that in a very circumspect
kinda roundabout fashion when we do do

896
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,530
it to make sure the upsides there

897
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:23,690
okay thank you for quicken lowbrow

908
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,090
quite

909
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,939
I

910
00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:09,859
yes

911
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:15,910
I sup I feel so it's closed in

912
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:20,670
%uh restricted we respected sobering up
techniques and although I shouldn't do

913
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:22,240
this I'm gonna show you

914
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,619
we did sobering up techniques and we
finished off with will smack in the face

915
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:30,309
so for you in you gotta see this

916
00:52:30,309 --> 00:52:34,109
this is %uh believable

917
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:41,109
%uh

918
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:48,640
the

919
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,339
and then we also did vigorous exercise

920
00:52:57,339 --> 00:53:02,320
I and so here's Jamie time in the
running on the treadmill

921
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,849
are are our second camera and Scott
Sorensen is a friggin

922
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:10,680
genius with a high speed camera he set
up these gorgeous shots it's Peter heed

923
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,710
my cameraman in the left side Jamie on
the right looking like that

924
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,710
man with no eyes from Cool Hand Luke and
here's me

925
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:21,390
on 5 Scott just in 45 minutes running on
its not

926
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,000
now here is work starting to have a
little trouble

927
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,800
up there that's messed up on the
treadmill and the track so

928
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,560
I'm starting to lose my balance

929
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,070
by

930
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:34,560
but I'd still go

931
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,420
then I realize I could step brown

932
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:43,030
okay except that for some reason I
decided to jump right back up I

933
00:53:43,030 --> 00:53:47,230
before every game I well

934
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:54,230
why

935
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,870
very good okay

936
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:19,660
express in he said before his speech
that

937
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,990
I'll you actually like to do read
actions and all that

938
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:27,930
retest things and all that are I'm one
person that runs what must you can buy

939
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:31,520
sometimes I can't I'll the one

940
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,560
tests that i've seen that always was
stuck in my head

941
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:38,170
was the American Graffiti blow on the
rear axle out

942
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,060
yep was there has there been I'll redo
it

943
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:45,200
an hour and being told anything I was up
I know we did

944
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,940
we didn't use the correct car the
correct car at that point that was the

945
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:52,540
very first season a so our budgets were
really well

946
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,140
that cop car cost us I think 3,000 box

947
00:54:56,140 --> 00:55:00,140
and that was freakin deal and

948
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:05,410
the actual the classic car that was that
the police car camera for what it was

949
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:09,220
exactly now but I know that we didn't
have the right ones for AXA we tried to

950
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,710
get one that was close to be

951
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,020
at that point run such a shoestring
really at two researchers

952
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:18,900
we totally messed it up up yet we might
end up doing it again Sunday

953
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:22,390
I it it has been on the list but now
it's

954
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:29,190
thank you I S

955
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:33,150
a I know you get a lot of e-mails
complaining about the way you do things

956
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:36,560
but you ever get emails from scientists
or engineers saying

957
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:41,049
I saw your show I've been working on
this let's get together for patent

958
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:44,470
journal entry something like that I
think gone on for their

959
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,540
yeah actually that's the vast majority
of the

960
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:51,980
feedback get is and even if you I don't
read the discovery portside

961
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:55,280
because as I discover don't wanna put my
son of a kind abuse

962
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,290
series they don't read the Slashdot
comments

963
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:03,759
yeah but whenever somebody it's great
source for

964
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,660
for screwing something up and not
knowing what we're doing the people that

965
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:07,930
rally to our defense

966
00:56:07,930 --> 00:56:11,520
are the working scientists and at this
point J mean I have been

967
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,640
can consulted and congratulated a

968
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,890
and by everybody Sandia Labs

969
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:21,759
oakridge the lawrence livermore nasa

970
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,020
any from everywhere a FBI everywhere you
can imagine

971
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:29,040
sites have come out of the woodwork in
not only asses how we did certain things

972
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,279
and one of the very first

973
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,560
my favorite my first David explosion was
possibly pressure

974
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:37,890
the fire that the boat to the few slots
have a airplane and blew it up

975
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:41,129
that didn't blow it up but then later on
blew it up show that

976
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:44,200
firebox the fuselage want to squawk and

977
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,440
we immediately after the episode aired
we gotta

978
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,930
call from when the head sites at the Oak
Ridge ballistic laps

979
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:54,510
the US US government's was testing
facility he said

980
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:58,910
I'm not only have we been trying to do
that experiment for ten years trying to

981
00:56:58,910 --> 00:56:59,930
raise the money

982
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:03,350
to perform that experiment because
nobody knew nobody

983
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:07,860
knew how that was going to turn out I
but you guys did exactly what we had

984
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,530
outlined

985
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:12,280
I you got attacked the results we were
imagined that we would get

986
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,470
and can we borrow your footage to use in

987
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:22,470
those are some of my favorite up that's
when we got the sides exactly right

988
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:27,180
ever been any products or practices out
there the air where that came as a

989
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,640
result if your show then

990
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,190
say as are there any products or
scientific practices that came around as

991
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,620
a result like the picture I have no idea

992
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38,880
I have no I know that we get I know that
every time I the airport Air Marshal

993
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,700
seek me out to tell me that their wives

994
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:45,320
now feel safer to fly knowing their
husbands are traveling with the fiscal

995
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,170
on their belt they feel safe they know
the pistol won't do anything but

996
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:52,170
I don't know if that's a good question I
think that about wraps it up for me I'm

997
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:52,690
