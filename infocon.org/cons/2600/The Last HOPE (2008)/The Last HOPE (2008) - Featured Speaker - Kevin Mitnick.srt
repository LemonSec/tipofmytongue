I'm sorry I suppose to speak your two
years ago but I was in Bogota Colombia

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,750
and even from the food or the water I
ended up getting really sick

13
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,030
ended up in the hospital in Columbia we
could figure out what virus I had her

14
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,300
what I A put me in there for about three
days

15
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,840
forever I'm sitting there in the
hospital have all of a sudden like three

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,170
days later the phone rings

17
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,640
I pick it up fair my family right some

18
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,500
guy from CNN ascap what's going on and

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,180
are first of all how did you know I was
in the hospital be hard to get my number

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,660
any sound we found out her in the
hospital wanna know what's going on

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,830
so just lemme second overflew but then
he's forgetting the more interesting

22
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,380
questions

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,429
so why exactly are you in Bogota
Colombia

24
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,539
I Tom I can tell but

25
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,369
yes I'm sorry to get to make it last I
last hope

26
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:48,979
I'm here today and I'm just gonna go
through are some stories

27
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:53,020
you might find entertaining on gonna
show you guys how you could easily on

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,130
mass caller ID

29
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,259
so when anybody calls you like on your
cell phone there's a real quick and easy

30
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:58,940
way to do it

31
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,319
so basically this you don't have privacy

32
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,890
get over it right

33
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,220
have any if you already do that you're
too young master caller ID when people

34
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,780
call you

35
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,860
as the old way of doing that is before
the incoming call to an eight

36
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,180
hundred-number than 40

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,330
front if the service is back but there's
a much easier way and last week

38
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,950
I'm proud to announce I got to sign my a
book deal with little brown

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,410
to publisher New York I'm gonna be able
to make my life story

40
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:34,410
I to wait a long time by finally I get
to tell my side

41
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,750
I have to wait seven years because part
of my plea agreement with the federal

42
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,330
government

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,580
was that I can't profit of my story for
seven years and that expired in 2007

44
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,550
and it took a while for my co author
night to write a proposal

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,660
and 112 these publishing house finally
got the deal so I hope

46
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,620
maybe in the next conference I hope this
is not really the last of it if it is

47
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,270
but the next

48
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,960
hacker con popular percent up a call to
you

49
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,600
salsa stories I'm I don't know how many
have you were here when I spoke four

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,360
years ago

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,580
okay we are talking about

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,360
30 percent to 50 percent side like over
summer the same stories

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,460
to sit back and relax hopefully the
people that were here will be

54
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,640
entertain when I first got into

55
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,260
our computers are really started when I
was a young kid was 11 years old

56
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,530
I was fascinated with magic and I used
to hang out at the magic store

57
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,570
on the weekends to learn yup my mom

58
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,019
used to go to work and I have to go to
school weekends are good matchups

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,040
store the kind of sit there and try to
watch the sales people perform

60
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,820
inclusions

61
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,480
and I I try to learn the secrets heaven
for manager

62
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,880
I fell into this hobby called amateur
radio here

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,840
I think just heard that are offering a
maturing yes and

64
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,960
when are you started an amateur radio
this is where I got

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,410
very interested in telephony because ham
radio

66
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,859
the amount they have things calm auto
patch back in the days

67
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,160
we can make phone calls for into it for
personal personal

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,350
use so once I got into amateur radio

69
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,359
I met another student in high school in
Los Angeles California

70
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,630
and this kid was in the phone free and

71
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,990
he went to the bar with my ham radios in
exchange

72
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,340
he said he will teach me a little bit
about this unknown world

73
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,340
me have telephones in this kid could do
amazing things

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,940
at a time I thought was amazing he could
call a telephone number

75
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,199
a local number put in the five digit
code call anywhere in the world little

76
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,009
did I know

77
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,470
he was using sprint and MCI at the time
if you have somebody is our telephone

78
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:49,910
number

79
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,789
he can call a secret number at the phone
company called a CNA bureau

80
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:57,620
and he can get the name and telephone
number if you just have my

81
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,379
parents names he was able to get mine on
they're not publish number

82
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,819
so this was all very interesting to me
so I became involved in this

83
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:09,449
area fun for and then because I'm a
prankster

84
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:12,990
I took this area of phone freaking the
night fighter

85
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,789
to pulling pranks on front sort of the
first things I did

86
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,900
was I access

87
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,210
but often come the switch in Pasadena
Calif and

88
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,359
I was friends with another guy that was
also in fun free

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,029
and I change the class a service on this
home telephone to that of a payphone

90
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:40,960
so whenever he or as parents we try to
make a call to police the post reporter

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,489
that was fun I was even more interesting

92
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,400
is intercepting directory assistance
there is a special way of calling

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,650
a toll free number and then with the AB
and CD

94
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,249
times you can actually setup intercepts

95
00:05:55,249 --> 00:05:58,419
a directory assistance around the United
States

96
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,520
and the really fix this flaw after we
have fun with them for about a week a

97
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,558
specially Providence Rhode Island people

115
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,569

116
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:21,639
you can go down to our phone center
stores existed at the time

117
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,469
and you can buy one for new phones that
has happened the

118
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,189
unfortunately that fun only lasted for
the weekend

119
00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:35,809
I because we did a lil bit more a

120
00:07:35,809 --> 00:07:39,180
immature pranks but I'm not gonna go
into the over here in this conference

121
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,319
because I being reported by the way
anything I talk about today just my

122
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,819
disclaimer everything happened over five
years ago

123
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:48,289
so it's possible stature stations

124
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,639
all rights of two so we know okay
perfect

125
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,349
but when I was never true radio I also
was a prankster

126
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:59,558
and my target was my favorite not my
favorite but

127
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:03,629
the most well-known fast-food restaurant
in the industry mcdonald's

128
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:07,539
have any half played with McDonald's
with review

129
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:12,050
the audience you know what fun you can
have right

130
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,279
so when a customer drives up to the
drive-in window and places an order

131
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:20,229
II with my friends Park across the
street

132
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:24,409
a takeover the system so now the
customers not speaking

133
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,759
to the guy inside with a headset he
speaking to me

134
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,640
so you can imagine right customer drives
up yes particular order please

135
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,549
the idea dr it's a while graduations
your fiftieth customer today

136
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:44,729
try for your orders for free the I'm

137
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,660
and I have a friend that did a really
good Indian accent right so

138
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,699
what happens the customer would place
the order and it kept getting repeated

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,000
back

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,920
incorrect right for you know for about
10 to 15 times the per person loses

141
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,449
patience

142
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,190
enforcers menu changes some McDonalds
were no longer with their hamburgers

143
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,720
french fries and sodas

144
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,950
was all burritos tacos hot dogs

145
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,480
so after messing with this one
mcdonald's this was in Hollywood

146
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,760
California

147
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,580
this is a they put a sign on the
drive-up window

148
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,320
that it's quotes as the fifth inning

149
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,020
nest so the manager

150
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,840
office mcdonald's comes out right after
we were playing with him for a while

151
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,090
he comes on is looking in the parking
lot and is looking for the corporate

152
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,230
who's messing with know their system and

153

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,420
so yessir those are kinda interesting
pranks

165
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,949
I'm

166
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,550
back into 1988 I don't know if you know
my kind of my history

167
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,320
that was the first time I was like
federally pasta for computer hacking

168
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,880
a friend of mine and I were hacked into
a company called digital equipment

169
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,090
corporation

170
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:51,690
and what happens we have a falling out
and he informed

171
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,920
the FBI what I was doing the set up a
sting operation

172
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,410
I was arrested at the time the federal
prosecutors have told

173
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,469
the judge that I have the capability of
starting in nuclear war

174
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,710
by whistling into a PayPal

175
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,550
at the time I was in court when I went
to court for my detention hearing

176
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,940
as a college I I was like expecting to
get out

177
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,100
because I just spent three days in
turmoil in federal prison

178
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,140
and it wasn't a fun experience and I got
a court and I'm ready I'm

179
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,490
no looking up you know when am I gonna
get outta here

180
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,460
when the federal prosecutor so that I
could just whistling to a fun and

181
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,860
started me for war

182
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,490
I actually current because I thought you
would lose all credibility

183
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,550
with the court for what happened is the
judge says

184
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,990
you're absolutely right mister
prosecutor in fact we need to make sure

185
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,120
that he's can you get to telephone in
the first

186
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,260
so I ended up in the whole solitary
confinement

187
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,510
but actually it was released a time I
was keeping my nose clean I found new

188
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,630
new hobbies and interests and

189
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,700
my brother called me one day would I
might a half-brother

190
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,620
it he told me that the sky eric heinz
wants to speak with me

191
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,950
that P used to be a hacker is a lot of
interesting things you'd like to talk to

192
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,750
be about

193
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,530
and like I have really wasn't that
interested

194
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:18,189
and my brother called me can't think
this guy really wants to talk to you

195
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,880
so I call the telephone number turned
out to be this guy

196
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,200
that wasn't Eric but what he would do if
you'd actually

197
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,440
pager or to his number need comfort
something like this

198
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,910
altra you know God

199
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,079
so I finally get this guy on the phone
and

200
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,910
he seemed very knowledgeable fun for you
you know a lot about internal systems up

201
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,140
the phone company

202
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,360
you know about equipment central offices
in the tree

203
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,140
because I have a passion for technology
so we set up a meeting to be that a

204
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,480
hamburger Hamlet

205
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,530
and I brought a friend of mine along the
gun even with the pain when incidently

206
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,880
was my hacking partner for a number of
years

207
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,189
we meet and we meet this guy Eric and a
hamburger Hamlet

208
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,340
any starts telling us that he was part
of the Kevin Poulsen case everybody from

209
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,180
a recovery Paulson

210
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,470
okay he starts talking about me about
all their escapades

211
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,140
into phone company offices I'm say
they're not listening

212
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,920
and I said so what happened to you
because Paulson was busted

213
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,230
he says well I was in Texas and I was
busted for some doing some sort or

214
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:25,740
credit card fraud

215
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,450
but they wanted some information about
how I was doing the frog the FBI

216
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:33,450
sigh cooperated with them and told them
how I

217
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,710
how it was able to commit these frauds
this is him telling me

218
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,890
into I got out early I gotta deal I said
so they didn't ask you about Poulsen

219
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,030
no really wanted to know about me
doesn't sound like the FBI know use the

220
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,790
one about everything

221
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,260
so eventually during a conversation he
says we're talking about

222
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,470
different systems at the phone company
cosmos

223
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:58,410
CCS I'm not going to all the devices are

224
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:02,430
release for all these names internal
systems up ma bell

225
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,250
and any pensions a system called fat ass
he goes you know about Sasco

226
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,990
maybe what what does it do this is where
you can monitor anybody

227
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,960
in Pacific Bell like I'm not going to
talk more about it

228
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,310
and then he clammed up and say another
word the median

229
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,130
I was intrigued I wanted to find out I
didn't know about the system called sass

230
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,939
what exactly is it

231
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,790
and how he told me he discovered it is
he cumples were actually in

232
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,469
want the phone company central offices
found the equipment

233
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,950
and were able to hook up a tape recorder
and actually record the protocol going

234
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,770
back and forth

235
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,510
so wanna give us a call the phone
company and using my social engineering

236
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,420
skills

237
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,850
I won't find up company for developed
this

238
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:53,010
talk and so after about

239
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,910
you know two or three phone calls I
found out the name of the company to

240
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,300
manufacture accepts

241
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,750
I do some research on this company and I
find out

242
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:04,980
but they were not a business no longer
in business said a little bit more

243
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,220
research I found up

244
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,540
the founders of the company tracked when
I'm at home

245
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,760
pretended to be a person working for
Pacific Bell I T

246
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,620
and I wanted to make improvements on the
system but I had no information

247
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:22,150
the guy says Wilson 3-1 other business
you want me to send you the design plans

248
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,610
for the different protocols

249
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,070
everything I could I can either FedEx it
to you are to fax it to you

250
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,080
what do you what so true fax it to me

251
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,430
so then I have all the protocols and all
the information howdy

252
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,460
access acid house s work is a have
remote

253
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,270
a RTP is Reebok test points in every
central office

254
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,930
and they've used computer terminals in a
tough department %uh Pacific Bell

255
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,230
and we talked to a concentrator the
concentrator with dial-up

256
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,810
to the RTP central office would use a
proprietary protocol

257
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,010
and would give the test technician
ability to make calls from that number

258
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,530
to listen to the calls

259
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:59,829
to do a number for different us
functions

260
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,830
so now I have the capability like Erica

261
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,130
using sacs so let's fast-forward

262
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:12,240
this is kind of a a lengthy story but
it's kind of interesting

263
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,080
sex only tube suspicious about Eric
because

264
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,930
every time we get together or talk on
the phone star like asking the questions

265
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,350
do you associate with talk to what other
what are other hackers doing

266
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,340
to be there was a big red flag in yellow
flag so I started to wanting to look

267
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,100
into

268
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,690
who is this guy at the time the Public
Utilities Commission

269
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,220
did not terror caller ID in California

270
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,510
but since I got switch access I'd

271
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,439
so basically implemented caller ID Los
Angeles

272
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,360
I setup caller ID on a friend's
telephone and then at 3:30 in the

273
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,210
morning

274
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,720
I called air eric's pager number the
call

275
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,270
telephone number he did and were able to
ID the number

276
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,790
and then from there get the address
information from the phone company

277
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:04,720
turned out this went to the Oakwood
apartments in Los Angeles California

278
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,939
and I decided well I gotta find a lil
bit more about Erica I just know its

279
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,110
name

280
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:13,059
call the local I find %uh from the phone
company unit number is living in

281
00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,129
I call it the rental office pretending
to be ok with corporate

282
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,049
was able to get the whole rental
application for apartment with from

283
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:22,250
terminated

284
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,750
and to my surprise there was no

285
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:29,150
work information on this application it
only listed

286
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,049
a mobile cell phone so

287
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,029
I did some research and I found out that
this mobile telephone numbers listed in

288
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:39,039
the name is Mike Martinez

289
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,640
and then to find out more information
about this number I need you to be the

290
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,410
customer

291
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,930
the social engineering for needed to get
into the site or from the company's

292
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,370
network

293
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,840
at the time I found a vulnerability in
air touch cellular so I was able to get

294
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,439
inside access to their internal network

295
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,180
but they give you the ability to do as
look at nicole's

296
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,940
that were originated from that cell
phone or terminated

297
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,040
and one number that kept popping up over
and over and over again

298
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,450
was 310 477 6565

299
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,559
which is the headquarters of the Los
Angeles FBI

300
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,570
so there are new that there was a big
problem for me

301
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:23,040
because this guy was either an
undercover agent for he was informed

302
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,780
so wire to tell you the story too

303
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,580
is because I have to go through what
trouble implement caller ID to get his

304
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,530
telephone number

305
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,530
I'm gonna show you how you can mask
private numbers because it happened

306
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,129
today

307
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,600
you to simply blocked his number I'm

308
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,990
after I got the cell phone number I
pulled all the Celtics

309
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,990
because I access to all the internal
systems when I started doing traffic

310
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,250
analysis

311
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,660
and found that the cell phone number was
calling

312
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,240
other phone numbers within government
other FBI cell phone numbers

313
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,360
not the end of the analysis I had every

314
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,930
telephone number to belong to the white
collar crime squad in Los Angeles

315
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,290
so what I started doing was having their
numbers

316
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,420
I was able to do originating and
terminating number searchers and then

317
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,809
when I started doing was

318
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,990
searching on Eric's number well who's
calling him

319
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,080
within their talks I'll and who's
calling Pacific Bell security

320
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,020
and I was able to find the case agent
cell phone number because he was calling

321
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,610
eric is going to signal security he was
calling different numbers at the pure

322
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,330
so that what I did is there was this
device called the DVI

323
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,220
aren't as everybody from there with a
few a tiny Marcus Almen Milwaukee

324
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,210
with the TDI device love you to do was
monitor the forward and reverse control

325
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,300
channel oval have a cell site and
actually people see calls

326
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,320
anybody remember the iDevice okay maybe
two or three times

327
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:53,110
so at the time I was working as a
private investigator

328
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,230
in Los Angeles and I set up in my office
a scanner

329
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:02,300
Mar monitored before control channel but
the cell site in Calabasas Calif

330
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,649
so anytime any of those agents if they

331
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,240
register their phone drove into the area
or through the area

332
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,420
it would alert would kept the the PC
would capture

333
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,210
the data and would alert me with the
page you

334
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,370
so on september 20

335
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:24,440
a 1992 I walk into the office in the
morning

336
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,650
and I fear this weird thing beeping
sound as I

337
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,370
openly the office for the PI agency
nobody else was there

338
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:34,580
like to see versus pp coming from and I

339
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,730
it's coming from my office week it's
coming from my PC

340
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,530
I go to the PC and see that a car when
the the case agents

341
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:46,690
telephone number actually in my central
office

342
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,030
I mean in in the cells right so I knew
the teenager was within two miles

343
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,780
before I was because I was a cell sites
coverage

344
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,760
so what do I do well i do two things
were happening

345
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,830
one I was under surveillance 42

346
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,139
they were going to my address in
Calabasas to get a description of the

347
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,360
premises for search for

348
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,500
I assume the latter search for so what
did I do

349
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,070
I went to which will start its and
bottom big 24 pack

350
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:17,450
donuts I wrote on the sign on my

351
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:24,450
refrigerator you know for FBI and I
cleaned out my apartment

352
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,840
but I wasn't sure if it was really the
pure okay

353
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,439
I don't know a severe I wasn't sure if
they're really going to search me at the

354
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,020
time so I was really unprepared

355
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,790
I we did the next day nobody knocked on
the door there was nothing happening

356
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,750
7xx I kinda blacks peso cup the donuts
in the refrigerator

357
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,810
and I went to bat

358
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,399
around five in the morning I hear
somebody putting a key

359
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,330
in my door actually a key I could hear
the kinda woke me up

360
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,280
and 70s like for messing with the poor
immediately

361
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,889
I don't think government I was so you
know someone is trying to break into my

362
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,620
part

363
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,730
secretly a jump and at that time

364
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:15,310
I slept nude for know too much
information

365
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:18,899
and ago who is it you know

366
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,060
FBI opened up open up and I was like
tassel right it was like 530 the morning

367
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,320
and I open up the door

368
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,610
I facing a female FBI agent right there
the American I

369
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:34,880
well bit embarrassing but but I'll

370
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,020
but oh well so in any case

371
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,550
once that happens I knew that the
government

372
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:46,500
a a was definitely looking into my
activities

373
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,060
so what I decided to do was use up which
I never really used before

374
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,510
and monitored in Fort so now that I had
eric's

375
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,500
telephone numbers that were in his
apartment because I got them to fund

376
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:58,930
company

377
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:03,510
I then use at us to monitor those
numbers for one day

378
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,050
and about after one hour

379
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,050
there's this call that comes in when the
call comes in here like it's

380
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:15,360
with the college is a sash you as you
call the free you put up a sash you

381
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,720
and then use that use asked actually lay
in wait for the call

382
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,720
get away with using with the column no
test right which you having

383
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,560
you can only use when the call is in
progress so the call came in

384
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,820
and I'm listening I'm actually at the
offices and SPI agency in Calabasas

385
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,370
and here Eric answer the phone

386
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,410
and its economy cap of a sudden they're
discussing

387
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,570
mitnick and discussing a search warrant
in evidence

388
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,270
I'm listening to this call all the full
attention

389
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:48,800
when I found out later this was a the
case agent

390
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,530
and the informant working together to
try to collect evidence against me at

391
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,780
the time so

392
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,800
on at that time

393
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,000
that's when I knew that I was in serious
trouble

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,880
and a I needed to get out attack so to
speak

395
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,190
unfortunately supervised release was
enough for another month

396
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,530
me if I left be actually a future for my
probation

397
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,820
so what i did. is by self-interest to
pay

398
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,740
we conspired with an attorney actually
to come up with a disinformation

399
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,700
campaign

400
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,000
meaning Eric had no idea we knew he
wasn't for me

401
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,310
working as a government agency but and
knowing this

402
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,790
knowing that he doesn't know that we
know we could feed him information that

403
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:38,350
would go to the and the whole purpose is
that disinformation campaign

404
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,380
was accustomed to delay issuing an
arrest warrant

405
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:47,270
are resting into my probation ended
because fans by time and what happens we

406
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,730
actually thought it worked

407
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,770
because nobody came after until

408
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,170
two or three days after I supervised
release to expire

409
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,880
so one tell you the story

410
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,390
is to give you a little bit of history
in my background what actually happened

411
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:03,890
with him

412
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,090
and now I'm gonna give you to stir

413
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,010
I'm just going 2-for-2 a quick demo
because I know we're running out of time

414
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,070
how

415
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,679
this tool would been very useful to me
back in those days

416
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,680
if I was still in an ethical hacker I'm
asking caller ID something to show ya

417
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,070
know video first

418
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,629
and explain it in week I could damage so

419
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,960
1 this is so provider

420
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,070
a SIP trunking provider called floor out

421
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:35,110
Rivera California and I think because a
feature for System

422
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:38,960
so allows you

423
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,230
to use leon ask are you so walk you
through this video its kinda slow

424
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:49,010
should have speeded up but I'm sorry so
my login to this forum

425
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,980
can I I created and when I first thing
to do is just

426
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,980
purchase if the ID and I'll walk you
through how this works

427
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,810
so Lisa got something useful other than
story something you can actually use

428
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,159
for your inbound calls

429
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,100
university ID you to purchase an Idaho
number

430
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:16,320
like about thirty-nine I just went
through every stop see it see what's

431
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:23,320
going on

432
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,639
I alright so we're gonna

433
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:37,570
it's going slow I can speed it up I
could stop it of course I'm going to

434
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,240
just go in

435
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,429
get the second Federation for Asterisk
taken to the registration

436
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:48,059
which is all common this is all

437
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:51,740
know for your stuff but I wanted to put
it in for people that are known to make

438
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,799
the video available

439
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,980
so this is so when i when a call comes
into the ID

440
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,860
who knows those were some the call so
here's my ass first bps box

441
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,149
something a modify Sep doctor I did this
by video

442
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:13,649
rather than doing a live because things
always mess up so this is all common

443
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:16,809
really easy stuff into something up with
the ID

444
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:21,519
and I'll get into how you why this works
once actually works is this particular

445
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:23,990
subtract providers like enterprise-class

446
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,169
so what happens is are getting the ice
up information

447
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:31,049
you're able to map supporters to the ice
up information

448
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:35,309
so you're getting the a you're getting
the caller ID information you're getting

449
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:35,990
the privacy

450
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,100
so no one will call when a call comes in

451
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,500
here's a super you see the from number
this is my cellular phone number

452
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,039
apps backing up it

453
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,750
okay

454
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:55,159
going from number okay which is the
number that i'm calling from

455
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:58,590
and the P certified energy is basically
a supporter

456
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,149
contains the same information hear the
call is not what this is about

457
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:09,149
call coming in second 100 block of

458
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:18,480
so if you look at a few if you can look
up here you'll see here in its from

459
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,200
anonymous

460
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,919
because it's a block all but since this
particular provider

461
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,100
still getting the peace or denied any
spillover map to the ice up information

462
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,159
you're you're actually getting the
caller idea P certified entity

463
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,940
better and then you're getting the
privacy ID and this means that the

464
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,549
privacy

465
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:39,389
Sep so all we want to do is work for
getting that information

466
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:44,440
when I do missiles a blind ass for a
script is basically look and see

467
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,100
if anybody's calling user privacy ID set
if it is

468
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,080
you love will pre-planned 902 it all set
that as the caller ID

469
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,080
and call me so I'll see the number
there's a privacy ID

470
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,669
there's a piece or did P certain
identity

471
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:07,250
sorry to check if the caller ID is
private if it isn't

472
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,529
we're just before the call if not we're
in a pre-planned the 902

473
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:15,539
so I have to modify extension Starcom

474
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:20,779
because everybody following this pretty
it's pretty straightforward and easy

475
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:21,460
actually

476
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,059
if you're bypass was before so because
there's an Astra spoke

477
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:31,440
I a well you'll see the moment it's like
a deadlock audiobook there's like one in

478
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,470
line in there that will hopefully go
away with the

479
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:40,470
when they come out with a new release

480
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,429
sorry this is a little bit slow this is
because of the Astra spoke in the new

481
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:55,429
in the first line tix curve what I'm
doing I'm just setting two variables

482
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,350
reciting the piece or did I D to the

483
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,139
to the P certified from us

484
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:08,850
identity from September and the same
thing to do is sell it for the caller ID

485
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,379
as well

486
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:12,639
be the privacy sir

487
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:19,639
you'll see the second so he's got the
copy these airlines and sign from the

488
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:22,029
county

489
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:29,029
NASCAR caller ID not get into a couple
more stories of just want to show you

490
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:36,399
this week

491
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:44,559
so I'm gonna do is if you see a line for
I'm gonna go

492
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,668
to a if if if the the privacy business
at

493
00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:53,179
I'm just gonna jump further down
otherwise I'm going to set the caller ID

494
00:30:53,179 --> 00:30:56,279
normally ok sometimes

495
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:03,279
whiny will see the second ok this is
interesting to you folks I I like when

496
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:06,889
people call me I could see their number

497
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:13,409
you know buses make because of my
business card is out there right so

498
00:31:13,409 --> 00:31:16,840
everybody calls me at all times a day
and night so like to see who's calling

499
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,899
so basically all this is doing lines
five in

500
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:23,110
5 this is basically something the the
caller ID

501
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:30,110
and dialing out to me through four
rounds

502
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,039
this the right time to to if the for

503
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,460
if the privacy is business Sep I'm still
gonna go

504
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,429
I'm gonna grab I'm in a free pen 900 to
the caller ID on the P assorted identity

505
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:50,710
and I'm gonna set you know something
call myself so what happens

506
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,909
is when somebody calls me and the
numbers blocked a pre-planned 902

507
00:31:54,909 --> 00:32:01,710
has anybody done this before

508
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:04,809
resist old stuff for you yes

509
00:32:04,809 --> 00:32:11,809
okay something

510
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,260
because I rarely find providers and
actually have that the peace erred in

511
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,440
identity in the privacy

512
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,279
but I'll provide you that information I
haven't found any so this is why it's

513
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,230
kind of unique to me I just found it the
other day

514
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,539
and that's basically a

515
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,840
so does anyone want to give this a shot

516
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,260
you call me on blocked to meif to my

517
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,539
idid and then you call me blocked you
want to see the difference or do you

518
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:37,890
believe

519
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:41,210
re: once if not see it or

520
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:48,210

doing a

525
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,929

cohesive it's free pending the nine
hundred and

532
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,419
what that means is when I got a call for
you see that nine hundred and and the

533
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:38,029
number

534

536
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,179
I wish I had this years ago a show your

537
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:51,320
I jumping around here

538
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,559
but I wondered you all want to see a
quick video is working with the

539
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,168
television company out here

540
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:00,580
to do a pen testing reality show and if
you ever heard of Tiger tee

541
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,100
have your TigerText was on for today s I
V two episodes

542
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,490
I was a great show I'm really sad the
council that I actually know

543
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:13,320
luke and I know I nope I know pyro and I
thought it was a good idea for the first

544
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
for some reason the council is a true TV

545
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,409
so another company has actually been
shopping around the idea

546
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:22,770
love be heading up on these reality pen
testing shows

547
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:27,060
and they just created a trailer and I
fought for the senate to me they sent to

548
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,899
be about five or six months ago I
thought

549
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:32,290
no I wonder what they thought of you
know is is going to be crappy

550
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,449
and I played it it was actually pretty
good because he blended

551
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,189
a lot of different scenes in from
Italian Job from Helios and so on and so

552
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,869
forth and so they all want to see the
quick

553
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:47,869
trailer alright alright hopefully with
if we can get sound here because we're

554
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:50,609
gonna need sound

555
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:57,609
so we have a sound 70

556
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:04,790

557
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:33,670
okay

558
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,490
what's called the most such fear

559
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,140
future Skyfire definitely the most
renowned

560
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:46,140
art art I can offer

561
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,520
sports

562
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,000
safe to Louis

563
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,730
by virtue of knowing telephones and the
computer systems while

564
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,590
of

565
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:09,760
he was arrested successfully says
fritters

566
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,760
of

567
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,890
%ah

568
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:40,890
school

569
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:02,510
%ah

570
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,200
possibly after pumped

571
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,500
they didn't act so that the cells will
trailer thought it was kinda cute so I

572
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,430
thought I'd share with you

573
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:36,430
a I don't think it's gonna go anywhere
because I can imagine Apple or the

574
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,480
tender

575
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,450
saying we depend test you and have an
unreality TV I just don't see

576
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:49,860
I don't see the benefit they don't care
about their product placement I wonder

577
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,920
if I of high school teacher if you saw
this

578
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,050
a II II never I think I've told you that

579
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,030
the story of this when I was in phone
for it in high school

580
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,750
and I was I had another student the
Sohae you might want to get a computer

581
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,100
class it's kind of interesting

582
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,470
and at the time I was like I am now I'm
just interested in telephones radios

583
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,160
acute care less about computers

584
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,350
and at the time

585
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:16,140
a to get into computer 50 like a

586
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,629
like a prerequisite trigonometry and
calculus in all the sort of thing

587
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:24,340
and the tacos were going for
electromechanical switching

588
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,310
crossbar over in the SS so I calf

589
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,500
half wanted to get involved in computers
but I don't have the prerequisites

590
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,670
so the student introduced me to the
school computer instructor

591
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,140
he said I'm sorry kevin you know you
have to wait to you

592
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,680
take these additional math courses we
can watch it so my friend says hey

593
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,210
show the teacher where you can do with
the telephone so I was able to do all

594
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:48,860
these like

595
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,880
neat things I that this though

596
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,630
you can imagine what you do with the
telephone system actually access

597
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,460
computers over

598
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,890
Voice and he says sure honorees are
going away for a prerequisite so much in

599
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,640
the class

600
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,420
so the first assignment was too

601
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,730
find the first 100 for the Nazi numbers
and

602
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,740
like dark now facing tree that was born

603
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,180
who cares about finding the first one
hundred for the not remembers

604
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,060
I was more interested in finding the
teachers password at the time can you

605
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,140
imagine you have an olive 8110

606
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,810
about terminal you dial up to the the
deck system

607
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,320
which is running risk to see your number
that any

608
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,970
you see acoustic up when you're doing
your in RR like beef

609
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,030
us fast speed of 110 ball so

610
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,670
the teacher when he was typings password
you'd like really shielded

611
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:48,050
and ago what is he trying to hide I want
to get us past so rather than writing a

612
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,090
program that would fund the first 100
for not your numbers I simply wrote a

613
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,510
simple login simulator

614
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:56,420
so what do we do it would simulate the
risk to see system that he was dialing

615
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:56,910
up to

616
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:59,940
it would take his username user names
were

617
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,560
it was actually a number one comma five
or whatever and ask for the password

618
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,960
interaction with login

619
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,640
but you wouldn't know that is actually
here you know talking to my code is not

620
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,129
talking

621
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,320
the operating system so that all we do
is we got some say mister Christian your

622
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,540
password is blah blah blah

623
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:17,600
here past need to change it

624
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,259
any configure out however do if you
actually maybe this

625
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:26,660
not not bullshit he actually made me
when he was talking to the computer

626
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:30,359
I actually have to leave the classroom I

627
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,600
this guy thought it was David
Copperfield right like

628
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,540
you know I can get a faster actually
have a the room he didn't know you talk

629
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,740
to my login simulator

630
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,570
sign up for that right getting his
password so I figured I wanna call up

631
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,850
I love to USC because they had the
newest games you know star tracks orkut

632
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,410
venture

633
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,470
right in my bones we want dial-up they
had a restricted

634
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:57,110
some trucks seek untill nine get an
outside line leave my phone

635
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:01,110
a phone ability you know how it worked I
simply you social engineering called

636
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,380
department called RC Mac

637
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,720
in Pacific Bell just added outside
calling

638
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,540
I would do is we woulda call into USC in
five games when you're supposed to be

639
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,430
doing assignments

640
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,529
unfortunately an awfully

641
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,100
all abedi putting terminal for teachers
able to come back to class in

642
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,400
look at the paper would housing the US
cities

643
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,740
looking at it new group of the paper at
a point

644
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,800
is getting so angry with us would
actually sign

645
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,040
a part of the the printout another

646
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,759
splinter now and I'm week we couldn't
take it

647
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,650
with us he's actually look to make sure
that the top was with the signature

648
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,030
so this guy kinda tiring for me so

649
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,790
want a shows up to class he brings all
the students into the classroom

650
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,910
he says students I found the one device

651
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,109
that's gonna stop having from dialing up
to USC

652
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,340
I found looking forward

653
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:02,420
that device and he hopes up a telephone
lock it was a tile

654
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,980
and he probably places that I walk into
the

655
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,620
into the telephone a number one position

656
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,920
and he proudly takes a key puts in his
pocket and he's a big smile on his face

657
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,140
of course I said mister Chris

658
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,290
what's the telephone number
administrative office

659
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:26,240
gives it to me and then you know the
pool centric his post of a number

660
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,380
this guy his face turned red he actually

661
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:32,420
took the phone this phone was like a
separate phone for the tile

662
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,080
and threw it across the room

663
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,200
so I guess I didn't get along too well
fight

664
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,770
computer structure instructors in those
days

665
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,450
let me tell you about the I can talk
about my funny happen the McDonalds

666
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,700
a and then I know we're running out of
time so just want to tell you what was

667
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,820
the most scariest kinda pack for me

668
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,440
and this is when I was a fugitive and
Seattle

669
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,540
on asleep apartment Monday

670
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:03,080
and I and I I have a phone I have
another top beauty art

671
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,340
25 was able to get the source code
itself

672
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:09,810
so what I did was able to modify the
phone so

673
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:13,620
one would sit in the idle mode it would
with would listen to the reverse control

674
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,779
chip

675
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,210
and what would happen is if the signal
met certain strict requirements would

676
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,200
capture

677
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:23,030
the min and yes n have anybody that
wasn't listening to some super cell

678
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,150
phone and put it into a table

679
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,530
rather than me having to go get yes and
then I am

680
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:32,010
my phone device will actually listen to
it and store

681
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,830
okay so what it is I went outside my
apartment

682
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:41,069
and I turned on my cell phone as having
a conversation with somebody I forgot

683
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:44,810
I was sunny here dude future

684
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,009
and there's a school where is like a
score I'm walking

685
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:51,880
it was like a military helicopter and

686
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,040
I'm just looking has nothing to with

687
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:59,190
of a sudden thousand land in the school
it is a call for you over my

688
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:02,690
at tutor tutor tutor tutor go

689
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,900
now you know I am II turn off the cell
phone

690
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,050
and I run and where I was in Seattle you
district

691
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:12,930
there's lots of covers and trees and
knocking out your I wasn't sure

692
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:16,560
was it would be worse I think parent so

693
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,650
I got like about three blocks into the
u-district

694
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:24,210
dockwise ducked into a store and I
turned on my cell phone

695
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:27,360
to make a call another son

696
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,880
due to return to return to her daughter
and the helicopter was coming closer

697
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,370
show know what's going on here so I we
did a lil bit and it was like

698
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:40,410
right outside the score that I just
wonder sugar salt

699
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,950
than I because if the situation

700
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,800
you can access full size in the store I
decided to go out the store

701
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,340
and go about it say about four five or
six blocks away

702
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:55,460
at the interview district in Seattle I
turn on the cell phone again and

703
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,030
damage helicopters covered

704
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,330
site ever found out what happened who
that was

705
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,529
for was a cellular phone company was the
government

706
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:09,750
for was a private investigation firm I
never found that on my discovery

707
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,190
without wats but I remember

708
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:18,620
I called my dad as a kind of startled me
having a helicopter chasing

709
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,759
so I'm privacy for covered by that by
page done with this

710
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,930
with a certain code go to a supermarket
to a payphone

711
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,000
week for my phone call for like 15
minutes

712
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,620
with my mother was a more intricate
system because I've all the

713
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:35,690
because I know if a government or law
enforcement agency knows you're gonna

714
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:36,400
pay phone

715
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,950
it's really easy history terminate the
original numbers I know because I

716
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,220
I did on that so

717
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,500
what I figured is a but my family had
contact them

718
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,190
is having going to a casino side have
they have a pager not page with a

719
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:50,630
certain

720
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,240
means start marash whatever right

721
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,530
and then they go in and listen for the
call the page like mary sue

722
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,390
and then go to the white courtesy phone
pick up a call that would be

723
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:05,650
gonna be really difficult for the
government to Tracy's calls

724
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:08,830
with my dad wasn't so it was I sit and
talk to him so much

725
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,600
was work on a pay phone sorry for
calling my had

726
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,280
believe what happened what's going on
helicopter just cheese

727
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,250
us Sun you really need help if you think
helicopters are trees

728
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,570
I I

729
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,620
I gotta get it was really chasing me he
goes

730
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:32,569
goes you really need to see if I call
you helicopters to see you cover your

731
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:36,870
you're being paranoid so anyway a long
story short it was

732
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,049
I was being serious but I never found
about who for

733
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,660
what had happened so what about doing
today

734
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,379
I its its

735
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,240
I I'm really fortunate know what I never
thought I'd be

736
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,910
where I am today and a lot of it has to
do with a lot of you that were my

737
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:56,250
supporters

738
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:00,150
arm I still give thanks to everybody
that was part of the free cover movement

739
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:05,150
you know especially Emmanuel and
everybody for the 2600 group

740
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,910
everything knew that there was no
influence on the courts because you can

741
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,049
influence the government for the least I
got them

742
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:14,130
message out there about you know about
some certain civil rights

743
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:18,360
violations in my case I never said that
I didn't deserve to be punished

744
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,650
but when a little bit overboard by
holding in solitary confinement because

745
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:23,030
I can launch before whistle

746
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,020
missiles by whistling launch codes so

747
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,080
today what I do as I go around the world
I do love public speaking engagements

748
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:30,930
not

749
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:34,190
1 I'm talking about now but mostly like
on social engineering and water the

750
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:35,260
security

751
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,580
I do a lot of penetration testing so
companies

752
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,970
higher hacking find what I was doing all
my life

753
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:46,690
but I do with authorization to pay for
and I don't have to go to jail for

754
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,720
such cover a win win win situation all
the way around but

755
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,860
I want to sincerely thank all of you for
being there for me when I was

756
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,060
I I was at the bottom of the bucket
during that time in my life

757
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,180
when I was sitting in federal prison not
knowing if I ever get out

758
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,649
the government was saying they want to
hold me for four hundred years

759
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:09,210
for making like 21 climb cell phone
calls

760
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:12,210
and I never have a light at the end of
the tunnel

761
00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:15,480
at the time the government wanted me to
become an informant actually want to be

762
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,040
there

763
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,320
tell on what other people were doing and
I refuse because

764
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,740
I have integrity not to

765
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:29,740
become a snitch on somebody else's to
get myself trouble

766
00:48:36,839 --> 00:48:40,480
unfortunately I what's happening that's
what happens in 95 proved five-person

767
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,210
times people cooperate against each
other into

768
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:48,290
everybody goes down and I just you know
again I didn't think that was part of my

769
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,960
personal integrity so I figured hey if I
did something wrong

770
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,180
I'm gonna take the looks forward I'm not
gonna try to bring somebody else down

771
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,830
with me so

772
00:48:55,830 --> 00:49:00,009
when I was going through this whole
process I have hundreds of people

773
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,140
writing me letters

774
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,279
taking my phone calls building web sites

775
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,730
starting the free cover movement I I
mean

776
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:12,060
and today I'm still thankful for all the
view that are participating

777
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:16,349
and supported be all those years I don't
know why love you are because

778
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:19,359
no I am when I was in prison I

779
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:23,990
no think as much access to email why is
when people with some even pronounce a

780
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:24,619
female

781
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:28,050
they would actually prohibit me from
looking up from getting a copy of the

782
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:28,420
email

783
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,140
say it's a secret code aka what do you
mean secret code

784
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,770
and they would look at the mine helps
got that scope

785
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:39,589
that's the intelligence if you're a
presence

786
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:44,060
but again I want to thank everybody for
being there for me

787
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,210
I am kind of sad that this is the last
hope

788
00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:50,230
because I kinda look forward to it I'm
re:

789
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,180
couldn't make it last year but I thought
this would be a tradition that would

790
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:53,848
continue

791
00:49:53,849 --> 00:49:57,109
were people that share similar interests
would get together

792
00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:01,950
and again I want to thank everybody for
the party for 2600 and hope in time

793
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:08,950
