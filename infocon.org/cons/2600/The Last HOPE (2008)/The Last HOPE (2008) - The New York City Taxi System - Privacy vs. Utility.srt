columnist for start of

11
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,380
I am NOT a spokesman for the taxing the
Commission

12
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,740
I maybe quite obvious in standing up
here on shaping with a black t-shirt on

13
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,790
by for those of you who can use the sole
difference I'm not spokesman

and anything that is in this
presentation and nothing came out a bit

16
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,130
exactly from the Chelsea nothing and
here's the new I it's all pulled from

17
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,140
data that's already been present in
other media is I was the only way that

18
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,410
let you present itself

19
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:16,270
without further ado we begin your city

20
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:20,670
you think all three icons you think you

22
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,130
always wants when they come to your say
take that one right in fact that

23
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,650
at least and fellow people's way to get
to and from work but nobody really

24
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,180
I thinks about how the taxi industry
works

25
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
no be you know get to the cabin wonders
how I wonder if this cab is making you

26
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,290
know

27
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,230
health wise guys make per year how long
is working or how long has been a

28
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:44,790
country

29
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,700
leopard that we arm so

30
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,360
this presentation is going to be

31
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,300
a introduction to the taxes and I have
to tell you a little better information

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,970
about the

33
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,380
taxes in general to get a bowtie pack
system which is cabbies

34
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,600
refer to it as the GPS system I you talk
about the issues that happened with and

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,489
paper reporting

36
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:09,640
solutions and concerns about the
implication and what's to come in the

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,330
future

38
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,720
my qualifications or why you should
carefully I am

39
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,670
I just I'm in the process of finishing
up to might interject accident scene

40
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,320
Commission

41
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,690
um was working to get a be

42
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,620
are with the data coming from the system
but I wasn't actually

43
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,940
working on the system all my research

44
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,760
noted center comes from external sources
um

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,700
like I said I did a little research in
the field that stack of papers

46
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,060
the first day when you walk in the tax
in the Commission when your new

47
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,090
employees they hand you this stack of
papers

48
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,030
it's about three blocks and those two
manila envelopes containing

49
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,650
15 20 articles in them and you spend the
entire first day

50
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,140
really no matter who you are inspectors
through Commissioner

51
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,319
you have to review K and it took me

52
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,350
all day arm I'm

53
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,620
a junior at the Pennsylvania State
University I

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,760
studying security risk analysis my
against racism information and

55
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,840
cybersecurity

56
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,110
I'm that's me

57
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,140
so taxes just acting like you know it
popular taxi hold your hand out one

58
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,459
context the out that

59
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:24,160
ya PO I actually in New York City there
are Ubuntu different classifications for

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,900
taxes

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,530
the one you might know best is the
yellow cat

62
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,419
yellow cab is heavily regulated by TLC
in NYC because it is

63
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,919
I the main entrance casick many people
who say

64
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,530
Kelsey regulates a whole bunch things
which were going to later

65
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,020
I you can pay cash and pick your ride
arm

66
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,080
taxes include a fleet govern
independence

67
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:56,080
I most the fleet

68
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,080
the different ways that carries gets dry
taxes that they get paid

69
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,320
is that they either only have themselves
are when the cab

70
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,750
or they try some of his cap for a while
I

71
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,030
if Lee calbos are basically what you
think that the they go they walk and %ah

72
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,490
they slap hundred dollars on the table
guy gets in the taxi medallion i'm

73
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,430
italian is little things easy on the
hood

74
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,180
if they lysis to it's the exclusive
lysis in your seat pickup street else

75
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,020
which is when you

76
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,000
order and on one comes by arm so that's
where you going

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,070
week is you attacks a

78
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,070
all these cabbies operate as independent
contractors stay

79
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,530
are tied to a specific a base for the
most part I think a free to play around

80
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,330
with everyone

81
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:44,289
INS's doubts driver own vehicles that's
a driver who owns the vehicle

82
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,039
he owns the cab itself and ranks the
medallion

83
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,539
which is again that the lysis which day
ball to the hood

84
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,580
I for certain amount per day week month
whatever

85
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,080
I and the third is independence where
they own holiday

86
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,919
have these days arm independent drivers

87
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,010
seem to make the most money because they
own the whole thing and they don't have

88
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,750
to pay like 100 dollars a day

89
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,930
don't let me die, arm at but

90
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,780
its a lot really expensive and I'll get
it out later and again

91
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,280
you can only hail near City yellow
taxicabs their hail

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,490
only I any other waiting them

93
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,910
has been outlawed by hearsay be used to
be

94
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:27,669
I this battle we could you know get on
the radio and

95
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,719
call for one but in 1985

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,620
that was taken away from them and given
to Liberty Tax

97
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,550
livery cab are coming for Chase
Community College the other cars they're

98
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,750
tied to a base

99
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,590
that means that they're dispatched by
someone who sits behind you know

100
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,990
well microphone you sometimes see like
at our I

101
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,360
train station arm the whole community
cars because

102
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,620
for the medallion cabs English is
required

103
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,669
you're required to know these little bit
he wasn't on the test but for these cars

104
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,919
he was is not necessarily a requirement
so you're free

105
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,580
the free to talk are any language that
really speaks

106
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,729
sell for example are cab company so the
Chinatown they can speak Chinese

107
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:13,810
cab company serving Little Italy or
what's left of it they can speak Italian

108
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,510
arm these are going cash or credit how
you pay in advance but he is

109
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,090
on and their dispatch only

110
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,580
the Third Kind is the limousine

111
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,190
Taxi and Limousine Commission I these a
corporate or private use corporations

112
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,400
can rent the Z

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,530
you don't get mad to their I'm place to
take home sometimes a few

114
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,590
are looking fine love like I was out
from the

115
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,979
Merrill Lynch building they have like a
lineup these cars lined up to take their

116
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:41,710
employees home

117
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,479
night arm again the dispatch only

118
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,389
I am when the wind up like that in front
like no one's building is actually going

119
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:50,590
to Big Bang best

120
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,620
I says dispatcher on the back like
shovels people into the car's

121
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,699
because they need to be dispatched they
can't be like hell

122
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,870
arm and if you if you get into one of
these cabs

123
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,570
that you hail it's not necessarily legal
arm

124
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,669
and it's a very bad idea to do it are
the rates are set by contract

125
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,789
arm contractor Sat

126
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,900
you by the company or by the initial
themselves for the calls the paper right

127
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,580
at the lakes for the epic for the on

128
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,380
deliveries which I talked about four and
these cars are fluctuating

129
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,820
their set by the a set by the market
itself

130
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:30,259
TLC doesn't regulate the price is the
that

131
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,250
individual factors so you could have
like a campaign to charges five hundred

132
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,719
dollars per

133
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,839
another country company charges play
Saturday

134
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,730
little more about your caps exactly
30,000 237 medallions

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,650
in circulation that number was capped in
1935

136
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:54,010
by all the costs back when years he was
ruled by a Board of Aldermen

137
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,439
it was set at that point because mister
haas believe that

138
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,930
New York City was too crowded Capsa
network they were too dirty

139
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,060
so he a decree basically that they're
only gonna be

140
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,180
a set number galleons give now again
those into the promise to pick up hills

141
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,290
of the street

142
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,339
arm that number fluctuated

143
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,410
it went down during forward to in a
little bit after but after the

144
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,120
I and during that time because you
really just walk into

145
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,459
taxing as a commission asked for
medallion and in a couple days that

146
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:24,699
basically Getty

147
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:28,530
by these days I we're back up at the CAC

148
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,870
there are people waiting to get these
medallions and these values wants to

149
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:32,500
give now

150
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,500
are traded like private property so one
person sell the Italian to another

151
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,180
person

152
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,170
and at the moment have leave the going
away from Italian summer in the rain to

153
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,979
five hundred thousand dollars

154
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,790
so yeah you can see why the independents
are pretty small

155
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,640
arm also these are really good
investment because

156
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,310
I day depreciated value for some reason

157
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,680
and so you have this five hundred
thousand dollar write-off on your taxes

158
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,250
i'm

159
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,110
good stuff arm Maxwell less than an
average taxi is five years the maximum

160
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,610
lifespan depends on whether it's going
by the driver is owned by the fleet

161
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:09,480
fleet vehicles are only three years
because they get beaten up or because

162
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,740
you

163
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,930
the guy doesn't owning by I independent
overs and does

164
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,830
are five years because you know they
shelled out the money to get the taxi

165
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,649
there's a global more use out

166
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:23,630
arm however they're all inspected to the
same standards the 200 point inspection

167
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,860
three times a year at a facility and
what site where they literally

168
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,560
go out the car with the BF crowbar and
poke at everything and make sure that

169
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,500
it's working

170
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,800
arm that spring weather while you know I

171
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,959
that one our standard most active
operating two ships

172
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,060
because you get the most money and pick
you know you the two ships the other

173
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,100
need a driver and I driver or a fleet
vehicles

174
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,330
are required to be operating
continuously

175
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:52,050
arm the only time that they are copycat
usually is when they have

176
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,540
major repairs the arm as you can see

177
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,110
that shark is from

178
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,209
at least for the taxi or seven runs for
a book which by the way all this

179
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:03,080
information

180
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,279
my presentation and the words for the
book is available free for download it

181
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,420
uploaded.net like one dot com

182
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,060
arm so people let me afterwards he go
download it

183
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,230
so it'll still be there arm

184
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,279
this is relatively recent backup conduct
warriors

185
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,380
are basic the workforce is everything
there the giant workforce

186
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,000
up New York City they can take a beating
and still taking I've seen things

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,300
I see crowd the Tories that get like run
over by a dump truck

188
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,920
and the store its amazing with these
things go after

189
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,829
arm and the weird thing is they're only
bolted to the frame like three four

190
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,740
places

191
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,990
I it's really weird home

192
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,420
but gaining on them is a things like the
Toyota CNN hybrids he's got like that

193
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,349
I respect from you talk a bit more about
how the fleet is aging and how

194
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:54,610
have to change that a little bit further
in the presentation arm

195
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,709
that's just really need to see you know
it's all

196
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:01,959
undertows look at our other writers
there about

197
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:05,660
depending on time today and depending on

198
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,189
what data we get is I it's now 17,500

199
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,540
writers now just about I see that
Monday's like the flow is taking them I

200
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,620
hate Mondays and Saturdays like

201
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,890
the most busy day because everyone's
going out to the theater and

202
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:22,500
up Saturday night his life VI to be a
taxi driver

203
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,100
I yeah I'm just as they travel about
three miles ass that's

204
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,870
you no further than a couple locks but
not as far as the eye could take a train

205
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,490
arm average fare comes out to be about
eleven dollars 63 cents this impression

206
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,880
by the way is about

207
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,279
the 2006 I'm I don't think I found any
information

208
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:43,470
newer than that I the average temp TLC

209
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:47,730
attacks in the Commission on me keep
referring to is TSA arm

210
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,730
TLC assumes that the average tip is 10
percent cabbies are

211
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,089
required to report their own earnings to
the IRS

212
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:58,519
ha so we don't know what their tickets

213
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,070
because a with you system he doesn't
support it can be

214
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,470
I because you know its UK we don't ask

215
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,880
on but they seem to 10 percent however
their is

216
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,649
information indicating a that especially
critical risk it could be as high as 90

217
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:13,610
percent

218
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,779
arm so again that fluctuates

219
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:21,550
I like I said this information from 2006

220
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,829
a little about hacks and you might be
interested to know that

221
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,350
taxi drivers in your city or call act
likes are specially on value drivers

222
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,060
that name comes from and sixteen
hundred's

223
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:39,050
Haxby caps where cabs that were defined
as being small cars that were

224
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,329
pulled around by two strong horses and
essentially getting in many you taking

225
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:43,760
life in your hands

226
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,970
because they whipped around London so
fast arm

227
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,490
and the drivers themselves will call tax
haha this is Ben

228
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,050
good Richard remove it I'll to also
refer to the process of making a taxicab

229
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:00,149
are make taking a regular car entry into
a taxi cab

230
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,100
is called hacking up a Cal because you
take his car which is intended for you

231
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,300
know a family issue turning into this

232
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,610
taxicab versatile tank an

233
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,839
one purpose for another packing

234
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,529
arm 30 percent right a nine per cent per
cent ninety-seven percent

235
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:21,600
the drives a male that sort by the way
his again for taxi or seven runs for it

236
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,290
which is again hell for download

237
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,319
arm and that includes

238
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,750
also FHB drivers for hire vehicle
drivers all drivers

239
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,350
essentially that's based on a small
sample that we can we don't I

240
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,570
taxing was the Commission whose art
doesn't ask

241
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,269
people for their country or region but
they did to a small survey and that's

242
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:42,339
what came back

243
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,120
I ninety-seven percent male because this
is the most dangerous job in your city

244
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,350
I like even liquor store owners don't
want to do this arm

245
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,980
you because according to be Hispanic
drivers Association believe it is like

246
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,829
I some ridiculous number like 75 percent
of all drivers have

247
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,339
and the victim obey crime in their taxes

248
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,740
I 50 percent have turned five or more
years

249
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,829
which seems to indicate that wall they
do you drive for long ish

250
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:12,579
time they don't necessarily drive for
the entire career

251
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,649
so they do go on to other things the
average age is about 45

252
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,260
and you couple that with the drive for
about five years and

253
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,380
the country or to the most people it
seems that

254
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,760
people its people who had come to this
country for

255
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,170
say the are expecting a job and a
manufacturing place in the

256
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,519
you are late offer don't get that job
and then they could be a taxi driver

257
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:35,139
instead

258
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,050
because its good work so it seems like
that's the way it's gone

259
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:42,860
they work about nine half hour shifts
stopping only for food and gas because

260
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,339
you're writing this taxicab

261
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:48,329
essentially and you gotta make that
money up you shell out to a hundred or

262
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:49,200
so dollars in

263
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,670
before you get in a cab you gotta make
it up as best you can

264
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,250
to get to that pure profit and again the
majority of these people

265
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,010
these taxi drivers are immigrants

266
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,950
and now the interesting part after I
bore you to death

267
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:07,100
so their cup problems with 10 people
reporting system as it was

268
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,600
I back between 1935 when this regular
when the

269
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,720
possibly its way into place and 2000

270
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,899
sex polluters others like a beautiful
day from

271
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:19,959
regulatory purposes taxi limousine
Commission

272
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:24,230
looks hats how the industry is doing and
a stop to that

273
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,940
regulates you know how much the areas or
how much

274
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,149
the lease rate is for certain days
because lease rate changes with

275
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,230
the game time so like they're more cath
more carries on the road

276
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,980
Saturday night and there are Monday
morning arm

277
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,600
their was like a universal card state
payment system

278
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,680
used to be a voluntary like some caps
with point

279
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,800
the pain in this car just be nice

280
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,000
by now it's pretty much mandatory

281
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,670
arm and as love

282
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,800
sometime this year it's gonna be roughly
100 San Fran and trashy into the caps

283
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:06,020
without caper systems writers wanted to
watch the progress

284
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,459
you know you got these out of towners
coming and and the don't know that there

285
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:10,790
be taken for a ride somewhere

286
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:16,079
like is circling I certainly Central
Park five times when I drop my summer

287
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,260
arm so they want to make sure that they
want you know spending money

288
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,439
unnecessarily

289
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,699
so they wanted to see

290
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,820
where they were in the GPS real map and

291
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:30,060
the back seat is in the lead for yeah
it's not fun look at the other

292
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,399
big party issue front view with them a
black bar and then

293
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,970
us any clear glass which may or may not
be smeared with

294
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,230
something I'm and

295
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,200
you know you try to look out the window
the entire time and if it's raining it's

296
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,399
miserable on so

297
00:17:44,399 --> 00:17:47,889
you want to look at so

298
00:17:47,889 --> 00:17:51,870
I this is

299
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:55,260
this is what one cab driver came up as a
solution I

300
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,750
this is back for the this is when into a
fact and basically

301
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,860
I all the stickers fellow all the
information wasn't stickers

302
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,840
on the inside the partition and he's
stickers fell off

303
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,899
so keep me signed which you know

304
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:14,310
please get have the money ready after
pace that occurring the curbside thank

305
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:14,740
you

306
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:20,190
driver doc arm and ted says on the flesh
this would have been replaced as soon as

307
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,690
he got these taxes only one side because
they be like new

308
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,540
out but for the time being is relatively
effective hand

309
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:33,490
you no information was available
generally on the stickers

310
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,220
trip she's I can read that no I don't
know I want you back

311
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,409
the this used to be the way %uh keeping
track taxis

312
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,230
I taxi drivers had to write down where
they started where they handed how much

313
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,730
they paying what time it was

314
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,850
on the sheet to keeping with them in the
cab at all times

315
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,740
so that like someone ran over Osama's
put his times where they know

316
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,090
which capped a arm the problem is that

317
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,359
illegible I don't know if you can see
out but it's completely alleged

318
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,060
I'm I've heard stories of taxi drivers
like mocking up 12 scribbling on it

319
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,158
and leaving the times blank so that Iran
over that but they could just make them

320
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,679
somewhere else at that time

321
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,740
I'll this is also

322
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,540
what how taxing was the PC sense to the
IRS

323
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,020
when they on it someone which happens a
lot apparently

324
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,850
I'll and the RSS have fun with that so

325
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,590
it's not really that good for keeping
track of a how the taxes are doing and

326
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,350
be

327
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,350
what's going on I all the information by
the other private information on the

328
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,550
back and it says

329
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,129
somewhere on I forget where please use
pen only because pencil was the

330
00:19:44,129 --> 00:19:47,379
is a lot and that that I

331
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:50,560
it so the solution is the TP access and
the

332
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,560
technology passenger hansen's project
called

333
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,220
accidentally by the drivers GPS is for
the main components that

334
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,530
showing their is up

335
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,770
doesn't display version they have it
that's not what I was always like right

336
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,119
when you walk in

337
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,090
of the inspection line I took a week
that was pretty cool

338
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,770
they just shows you you know all the
parts all the technology that goes into

339
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,129
the gap to make a taxi

340
00:20:15,129 --> 00:20:18,770
so what is its

341
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,590
you got the him which is the passenger
information monitor

342
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,290
that's good how all year important
information which is not a

343
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,840
daily Rowley depending on which serve as
the Cal uses

344
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,639
arm in here have some caps have like
channel seven news Ryan there a chance

345
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:36,350
for Newser

346
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,149
some caps just happened advertisements
and their

347
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:44,700
arm it uses real time GPS positioning to
figure out where you are and plotted on

348
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,919
a map

349
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,980
and there are three different companies

350
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,409
that supplied its there were

351
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:55,440
different three and another for in their
three again because

352
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,280
something happen to want them up but
basically three different companies that

353
00:20:59,280 --> 00:20:59,889
do this

354
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:04,020
and are three different implementation
styles so as you drive in cab still see

355
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,869
this

356
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:08,270
I'm the

357
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,030
20 percent her yet twenty percent time
on the screen sharp attacks in the

358
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,609
Commission

359
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:17,389
announcements like Alice the fairies how
much your knee pain

360
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,580
how much or other news items that

361
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,270
TLC might want to put in there so rather
than having

362
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,190
all time for advertising you have to
have this chance laid out for TLC

363
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,139
other things you have to be by TLC
mandate able to control the thing

364
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,639
to get him to turn a profit from the
brightness down volume down so

365
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:40,889
you know you don't have the Today Show
blaring in your ears while you drive to

366
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:41,379
work

367
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:44,690
is that knowing

368
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,419
a 2d SMS messages to the cabin

369
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,200
this is added right next to the right
next to write under

370
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,020
what's called the meter it's basically

371
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,060
a little cell phone in a box as a short
messages that he sent

372
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:05,010
cap like a like says they're traffic
alerts fair opportunities in emergency

373
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:05,560
information

374
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,560
so if you remember when the

375
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,770
wall fell down on me was that the

376
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:16,899
for that was but when the wall fell down
the highway on the

377
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:20,980
left his west side thank you

378
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,429
I when they're all done less highway are
they

379
00:22:24,429 --> 00:22:28,129
they could have told all the drivers
that hey this thing happened avoiding

380
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:32,340
arm fair opportunities a cruise ship
docks or our show gets a little bit

381
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,119
early they can message in caps and say
hey happen

382
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,669
a logical pick these people up so that
they know where the stuff is gone now

383
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,359
I'm an emergency information I haven't
heard a specific instance where

384
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,939
this system was actually used to
broadcast emergency information summer

385
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,010
arm buddy is available for use and

386
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,619
they can also use this to send messages
to specific caps for example

387
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:58,000
you leave your purse in the back to
catholic masses the cap and this only

388
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,859
works

389
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:03,040
if you're going five miles an hour or
less sarcasm candle on accident

390
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,070
arm as because you know not everyone
listens to the radio

391
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,369
to

392
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:13,820
quicker payment systems I caps no longer
predominately casual

393
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,210
used to be the head carry like fifty
dollars cash take cab ride to JFK

394
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:23,290
now we just need to guard it uses while
special authorization so it's not like

395
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,960
they have to plug in the capital
Ethernet jack every time they

396
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,179
one get the money arm all major credit
cards accepted

397
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,669
there was something while ago where some
calves

398
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:36,560
didn't want to take certain credit cards
but all major credit cards have to be

399
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,678
accepted

400
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,119
arm and payments under twenty-five
dollars don't require signature

401
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,580
so going to JFK will still quite awake
named by

402
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:52,580
going down the block he could just fly
to Canada there's like a carton trap

403
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,879
in cab GPS this display by the way

404
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:59,950
this is the display drivers

405
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:04,409
and owners a fleet vehicles get to see
tax in this information does not see the

406
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,530
screen at all

407
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:10,220
but the GPS is constantly updated
position it's ended things it back to

408
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,990
server

409
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,030
restored and drivers and owners can see
how we can spend

410
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,109
it has automatic for two generations so
that mess that you saw before doesn't

411
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:20,189
happen again

412
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,379
I and the cat but as the numbers it's
got pretty easy to imagine so you

413
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,520
seriously is going with what it's doing

414
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,710
you know if it's clustered around one
little place in

415
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:33,710
advise them to move other places and its
again seen by the flea

416
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,520
owner or by the fleet owner where the
owner only

417
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,730
so know that's the mite activity

418
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,970
the only think that he'll see actually
sees is

419
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:48,139
dietrich pick up location drop-off
location

420
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:52,330
he just means that they won how the time
it took to get there and the amount that

421
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,060
the fair was

422
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,590
and I think the last four digits and
credit card so

423
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,970
it's not like get a good deal see
expense

424
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,330
like I said its costly updating there's
all graphical why is the digital

425
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,418
dispatch system

426
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:09,859
on display here arm basically there's
pay

427
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:14,250
cell phone line to a set of servers that
the company owns this three different

428
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,149
companies are three different servers
three different systems

429
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:20,349
arm and so it sends out a as and a2

430
00:25:20,349 --> 00:25:23,439
depending on what it needs like if the
entertainer is being updated or

431
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,220
something

432
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,429
arm or if passenger gets on the cabin

433
00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:31,389
relates back all information and the
drivers can then

434
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:35,639
are query that server and see you know
what a trip chief look like or

435
00:25:35,639 --> 00:25:39,169
dry winter the owners can see you know
where the captain

436
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,849
and GPS also getting here

437
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:45,889
so what concerns about this

438
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:50,349
well Wireless him problems youngblood
dead spots

439
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:53,418
you know near City isn't perfect I was
just you know couple

440
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:58,590
blocks away guessing all us so
authorization is fine at maximum 25

441
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,119
seconds

442
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:03,200
if you waited more than 25 seconds and
just bottle of riser card

443
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,950
I must be a mistake to three seconds
though and Mac sometime when is the main

444
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:09,379
G seven seconds are also

445
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:13,320
our office I and there's a city cue

446
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,939
and when I get back in range auto
authorizes but the thing is

447
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,030
if the card is think he swiped through
and

448
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,200
it times out the driver absorbs

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,300
all that money he takes loss on that so

450
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,639
wallets really good system and it works
in a lot of places there so that

451
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:37,399
opportunity I Guess there's still that
possibility outside

452
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,669
that someone could do something less is
with us but again

453
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:44,520
now is gonna be directing someone who
are known dead spot and sliding

454
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,520
hard to get our in

455
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,190
access at JS

456
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,750
I'll but the thing is

457
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,990
those early keep

458
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,760
he I the card number storage and
transmission

459
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:10,550
our members-only stir by are strong
third party servers there's a

460
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:13,710
full card numbers and that's it
compliance with PCI

461
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,290
standings everyone does that from 2600
all went to Kmart

462
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:20,090
stores here credit card somewhere in
Davis because they have to have been one

463
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,500
of the rising

464
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,679
fascinating commission only seizing and
last four digits

465
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:28,980
transmission is over cell network but
legally nice a source in south on

466
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,800
africans the scandal the only but may
flake doing that has like 20 years old

467
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,050
so it's hard to get a and also your

468
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,280
when you're skipping for this data yet
remember that you have

469
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,590
like maybe 50 caps in the city and in
that pussy it also have

470
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,169
at least two people per cap because gay
driver and passenger and so that's

471
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,510
already one-third dated only one-third
AP actual

472
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,169
captaincy years that's a long as ratio
and then you've got people walking

473
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,099
around and you've got all the other
stuff going on so

474
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:05,310
picking out the signal is very
heartening

475
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:09,020
other concerns can in effect is
something that he's I GPS the satellite

476
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,379
technology

477
00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:15,369
it's where in New York City a lot all
buildings he can always see all free GPS

478
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:19,109
satellites and I just saw this you got
going over today

479
00:28:19,109 --> 00:28:22,178
like we start of a GrandCentral and then
we like

480
00:28:22,179 --> 00:28:26,399
take a right into the building home what
happens is

481
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,490
that when it loses the signal it
continues going

482
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,159
using odometer on the path that was a
going before

483
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:36,790
so if it like me to wake turned keep
going in that direction

484
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,690
I so that's like when you get Inter
Milan New York Harbor you get dropped

485
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,340
off

486
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:45,060
like at me once up but these things are
required to be ninety percent

487
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,040
ninety-five percent

488
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,070
after at minimum when they're working
and

489
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,480
honestly when you lose your signal a GPS
signal its

490
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,119
is so the little quirky distance time
and other things accurately

491
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:59,250
it's just young might happen drop-off
location

492
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,290
be so

493
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,200
does have GPS mean that you track your
drivers wherever they go

494
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,730
I again by contract UPS is only likely
to pick up and drop off

495
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,609
all that data is sent to the third party
service because

496
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:18,080
if you think about it you know these
owners only cap

497
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,089
they and the whole thing sissy where
their property is

498
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:25,300
is an acceptable idea rental companies
do this but

499
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,440
callers and private citizens do this
with their own cars as well

500
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,440
so it's not a new idea having GPS
tracking

501
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,909
your property and again only the owners
up that car

502
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:41,010
and that GPS as you can see I comes
every few seconds

503
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:45,869
but they're Starbucks Coffee is not and
drop by the TLC

504
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,780
so you've got credit cards and GPS

505
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,560
in the same database does that many
contracts it is

506
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,629
the official data collection storage is
handled by third parties which means

507
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,589
you've got

508
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:02,109
three different servers that the stuff
is real a resigning it's not just one

509
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:03,429
central server

510
00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:07,320
all the information come so you've got
that working for you

511
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,990
that you have a one in three chance
actually getting of the information

512
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,010
you're looking for

513
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,040
a second thing is that a lot of people
still paying cash so

514
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,810
if someone takes a ride in case you cash
it's not stored in database

515
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:23,668
can't do it arm and again last words to
receive a TLC

516
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:28,000
see can track it with Chelsea Davis it's
very difficult

517
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
seeing as there's like again seventy
thousand 500 rice per hour

518
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
it's gonna be the math is pretty good we
have multiples the same last four digits

519
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,359
my slightly Health Net Protector art for
those who do

520
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:48,040
you who have I gotten it yet it's that
yellow cabs report to

521
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,369
the city servers that they that their
system belongs to you

522
00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:55,200
and then the system servers filter the
results and send only

523
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,250
the results that he'll see requires to
the TLC servers

524
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,859
TLC doesn't get any that any that
potentially hazardous data

525
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:08,639
it only gets the cleaned up version
there

526
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:12,119
so why did cabbies go on strike it seems
like you know most these things and then

527
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,780
again

528
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,129
you know only the owners get to see
where they're going you know are you not

529
00:31:16,129 --> 00:31:16,669
really

530
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:21,200
tracking them all the time retract the
matter that can be

531
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,070
harmful to them you tracking by the on
here not

532
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,560
reporting all that did 50 LC you're not
reporting all the idea

533
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,639
to a government I a government agency

534
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:35,950
here story that out their price server
young

535
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,770
it it's not it's not so hazardous that
you want to go on strike in those like

536
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,210
thousands dollars today

537
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,369
but thing is the main reason behind this

538
00:31:46,369 --> 00:31:50,020
and this is my opinion here I main
reason behind this

539
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,480
is money these drivers report

540
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,260
their own earnings to the IRS there
earnings

541
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,800
her being reported to a government
server they are concerned about this

542
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,070
because before where they could you know
maybe under report their earnings

543
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,030
now if their audited it's all there in
black and white

544
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,330
they don't like also the GPS system

545
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,678
II for this week at ease is about 5
percent

546
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,929
%uh the total cost the car so when you
take in and week out you know

547
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,770
independent drivers and fleet drivers I
her fleet owners rather

548
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:29,139
are take a bigger hit on this thing they
were ready

549
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:34,460
but the good news is that the GPS system
was implemented when hefty increase

550
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,210
in the taxi fare was put in place by 12
mayors

551
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,349
Africa it but he put a tax increase and
and

552
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,460
tacked onto that was that this GPS
system would go in

553
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,919
so in theory they shouldn't be losing

554
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:52,050
really any money on this but this
awe-struck

555
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,230
because you know they were afraid that
all the data will be reporting that they

556
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:55,750
be on

557
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,849
more easily and they start have no power
over earnings and

558
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:03,408
they're gone up this month

559
00:33:03,409 --> 00:33:07,419
so what benefits the cuss the drama in
the industry that will make us want to

560
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:07,950
do this

561
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:11,820
what we now do you that would
rationalise the even-money

562
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,770
risk that we're taking arm

563
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:20,190
the first benefit is that the most
obvious one lost times not last long

564
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,460
I if you look in the data is a loss
items you see like cell phones Pocket

565
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,750
Books things that are left me back a tax
cap that people call in like

566
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,560
oh my god I forgot this I was just here
and now

567
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,408
her back in the day you couldn't look at
like all the tricks she's in real time

568
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:37,190
and figure out

569
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:40,409
all this cap is over here your obviously
this one let's call him

570
00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:43,460
but now with the system in place there's
a method

571
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:48,250
for you to call 311 next forwarded to
TLC operators and then they

572
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,580
will take a review and you tell them you
know

573
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,200
have went from here I got dropped off
here and his last words my credit card

574
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,099
or

575
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:59,908
here's the medallion number that's
beautiful always keep the receipt

576
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:01,230
dialing numbers great

577
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:05,960
arm in and they can figure out from like
three or four those data points

578
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:10,179
which cat urine and from that they can
either as a mask cab

579
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,879
or they can get they are give a call to
the flee

580
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,098
own and say hey when this cap comes and
check for the like this self on the back

581
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:21,730
and then you can have your data back
with an like minutes

582
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:28,730
he said i've weeks or never

583
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,050
the other thing we get from this is
statistics citizens are always great

584
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,429
when you have a regulatory agency
regulating all the stuff that happens

585
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,230
arm data the the data that's available
help set the rate

586
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,690
the capsule lestat and the rate upstairs

587
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:49,168
so if for example the TLC start to see
the cab is eating less money

588
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:52,399
that gas is increasing but fares on
increasing with it

589
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,949
arm that

590
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:59,368
you know certain times a day there's no
cabs on the road

591
00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:02,540
they can adjust police raid and just the
fairway

592
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,220
to make it so that cat is doing that

593
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,280
I also about leaving the international
different projects for example

594
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,400
the fleet is shifting over to Hybris now

595
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,230
mom so they're tracking you notice the
hyper cab

596
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:20,290
do more business than average cap to get
a better kept as a

597
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,630
you know I make more trips does it go to
certain places more

598
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,970
arm the other thing had is also
accessible dispatches another one things

599
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,020
that we're doing

600
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,869
vertices doing home defense with respect
for his recall

601
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:36,900
311 asked the dispatcher are asked the

602
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,270
the operating send you the dispatcher
the dispatcher will dispatch

603
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,109
accessible Italian cab to come pick you
up here in Wiltshire

604
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,380
and this is hopefully making you know
you see more accessible

605
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,390
still now for testing you can't use it
yet by it's coming and if

606
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,230
we see if Kelsey press is good results
from the test will dispatch program

607
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:59,789
will be borne out in the statistics and
they can go ahead you make changes to

608
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,200
enter implement

609
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,359
il's the effectiveness of incentives
they raise the least make they raise the

610
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,078
fairway

611
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,380
how does that affect it the if effects
in a bad way they can

612
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,670
change song the benefit

613
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,890
that the average user Han the

614
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,950
owner and the fleet driver and the Akai
entrapping the Dubs gets from this

615
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,980
more than outweighs at least in my
opinion the

616
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:28,559
possible risks the system

617
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:33,329
the other part is that the working on
they are working on

618
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:36,779
times a got perfect by

619
00:36:36,779 --> 00:36:41,519
October all new cabs and I said you know
caps a phased out in five European and

620
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,680
so the next

621
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,700
a basic ads is going in by October

622
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,519
25 miles per gallon mandatory for all
caps

623
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,539
all-new cows but will have to be 25
miles per gallon or better

624
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:56,109
city mileage I be crown victoria gets

625
00:36:56,109 --> 00:36:59,400
I think I get sixteen on paper and all

626
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,569
about 11 on the books her in real-life

627
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:06,670
so it tells the gas and this I'm than
425 miles per gallon

628
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:09,910
I'm I was listening to the city council
meeting

629
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,430
and a lot other drivers quite think that
you know /url on the owners rather

630
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:16,950
writing because you know there's not
enough Tigres they take too much to

631
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,900
to hack up they're not as safe as the
Crown Victoria which again is a tank

632
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,640
arm but you know type a Mossberg down
you're gonna

633
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,509
makeup and saving you saving gas her
make up the cost of gas

634
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,640
its me thirty miles per gallon next year
and starring 2009 black cars but

635
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,970
remember the limousines

636
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:38,549
re-start stop following roughly the same
schedule implementation

637
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:41,720
you guys the time line but sorry 2009

638
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,569
like I said the excess will dispatch
programs gustar is gonna start working

639
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:46,920
again is still an alpha testing

640
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,730
they got testers going out there no
working on the stuff

641
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,809
I'm I forget reports South on

642
00:37:54,809 --> 00:37:57,950
by its its something's coming up that
hopefully

643
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:02,789
next time a foreign mayor comes to visit
our city he doesn't have to like

644
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:07,309
strap himself back but actually it is in
welcher arm

645
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:11,390
so and the taxi tomorrow

646
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,440
this I doubt it's really weird

647
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,109
but this is a white up the designs is
coming out a taxi tomorrow program

648
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:23,140
there is no actual taxi on the market

649
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,819
right now you have to by a family
vehicle and hack it up to make it into a

650
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:27,529
cab

651
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:31,700
so white near city is trying to do is
design the perfect cap

652
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,119
what would be the perfect app now it has
to be

653
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,329
wheelchair accessible for disabled
people it has to be

654
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:42,470
people with disabilities excuse me it
has to be I

655
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,089
safe for the driver has to have you know
a large cargo capacity

656
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:49,599
I this is a side view this outlook now

657
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,230
it's got this is won the designs at the
thinking of

658
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:59,690
well I'm not necessarily figure this one

659
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:04,799
are but in post-apocalyptic your sayin
might do well

660
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:09,430
I am because everyone loves rooms

661
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,538
that was that the the taxi 07 kickoff

662
00:39:12,539 --> 00:39:16,220
this was one of the models that was
presented as or the job but its

663
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:20,680
so pretty cool this is

664
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,190
really exciting for the taxi industry
because this is the

665
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,269
Ford Transit Connect this is the won the
first

666
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:31,000
cars that Ford is specifically made for
any company specifically made

667
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,480
for a taxi is the first No time that
they're taking notes that the taxi

668
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,119
industry is a

669
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,339
actual industry and arm and ensure they
can market to make money off of Route

670
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,578
so as you can see at small

671
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:47,750
fits nicely and York streets got big
open doors

672
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,049
this is look inside II NCAA

673
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:54,680
you know nice clean the floors good
partition

674
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,129
a really weird map new york city that's
a new a relief but that's okay

675
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,420
arm doors that open on both sides

676
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,650
strongly Gulf this is another

677
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:12,250
slightly weird car that's coming out
this is the

678
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,589
for what's called but this is another

679
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:19,400
the box this is not a cloud that was
developed by Capcom

680
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,430
by car company to you be marketed taxis

681
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:27,200
sickly and it fits entire family inside

682
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,920
you might remember that the Crown
Victoria is a little cramped

683
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,059
in the back you can fit in three for
people

684
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:37,430
up but there's a family so that what

685
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:40,598
which is exactly what you want because
you want space for to say

686
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:43,769
people with disabilities to be able to
get in there you want

687
00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:46,720
people strollers be able to get in there
you want people to luggage to be able to

688
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,180
take their luggage in there

689
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,930
arm and it fits them rather comfortably

690
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:57,129
so I that's about it special thanks to
you

691
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,160
TLC for letting me do this

692
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:05,589
arm Bear Stearns because I was really
working for bear stearns the summer

693
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:10,190
which doesn't work too well hi and so JP
Morgan Chase

694
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:13,819
placed us at like non profits from the
city and i got really like he was placed

695
00:41:13,819 --> 00:41:14,940
with Chelsea

696
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:19,279
how was your grade 12 guys and girls arm

697
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:23,079
at 2600 and last hope because I am

698
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:26,410
doctors to be the underdog the Oilers
thank I

699
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,190
cap for being my photographer and of
course the Beaver Stadium

700
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,589
again I'm not a spokesman faxing leasing
commissions

701
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:36,839
please do not take anything I've said at
all as gospel

702
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:40,869
this could be completely wrong for all
your from

703
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:45,029
so that's that now arm

704
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:48,039
that's not what I want to do it all
there okay

705
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:53,019
are hold on one second again all this
information is available blogger Nick

706
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:54,089
Blackburn dot com

707
00:41:54,089 --> 00:41:58,630
there are microphones there and their if
you please use them so that people

708
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,039
listening in the future King understand
what you're talking about

709
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:05,240
I'd appreciate it yes some have two
homes

710
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:08,400
the entire presentations on

711
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,519
and I have to ask two questions: um one
thing I was wondering is

712
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:17,039
a how do media updates going India in a
cab for example did

713
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,970
shows all the call the date is pulled
over the as far as I can tell

714
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,099
I only saw the innards the digital
dispatch for them which is

715
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:27,549
the for yourself up but it seems like
all the day's transfer your

716
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:30,750
the cell network so when new data comes
out it

717
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,720
you know was at the gap okay and the
other one a question I had

718
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,529
you told me that they're three companies
who handled the the credit card

719
00:42:38,529 --> 00:42:41,279
transactions in the media everything is
inside

720
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,000
are is it possible for these companies
to to collect both credit card

721
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,859
information and

722
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:49,220
GPS data because it's is CS arm

723
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:53,009
but that they're I

724
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:56,430
texting with the Commission and has
gotten a lot of flak over

725
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,868
this program particular because you look
like an all-state and

726
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:03,839
arm the three companies themselves are

727
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,839
its broke up to three companies see God

728
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,089
13 chance of hitting the right database
for your information

729
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:14,470
I and that is a concern arm but again
the same concern when you swipe your

730
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,900
credit card the Reds

731
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,619
I don't know which is which I read a
trustee when government organizations 35

732
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:20,430
10 companies

733
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,089
dresses well that's that's the best a
best as you thinking

734
00:43:24,089 --> 00:43:29,299
come up with some excuse me do you know
the fastest way to disable the

735
00:43:29,299 --> 00:43:33,000
that line to cuss for a number one is
that there's like no

736
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,750
of buttons the Kansas like always
playing in second is

737
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,970
sometimes I would just like that stay in
Google Maps Moten

738
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,529
always minimized after 10 seconds and
starts growing on these banner ads and

739
00:43:43,529 --> 00:43:44,269
everything

740
00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:47,750
so is there any way to get rid of the
ads well he's either a get ripped ads

741
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,579
are just turn up the

742
00:43:48,579 --> 00:43:51,579
contends on the system use I

743
00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:55,039
certain systems I know you just hit the
maximize button and areas to rescue

744
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:55,730
trapped

745
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:59,650
I us on some systems have the easy off
button some you just act like you're the

746
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,430
greatest volume to work saw

747
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:05,660
I it depends on the system it's just an
independent but they have to have

748
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:09,868
jus me those controls implemented incest
so there's always an off switch your say

749
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:13,869
there's always some way to turn there
always has to be

750
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:19,099
are they are each cab online full time
is it a persistent connection kisses and

751
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:21,839
the like in your presentation they're
dropping break comes like every four

752
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,109
seconds is there

753
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:26,549
going through I the city when they are I
basically

754
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:31,109
have a passenger so that is that sell
connection persistent not sure

755
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:34,950
again I ask why these questions that
providers themselves but they

756
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,589
DVT not respond to me offer unknown
reasons

757
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:41,680
prolly cousin for the you have a
convention um he

758
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,558
by I I'm not sure all I know for sure
for

759
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:49,319
absolve fact is that they transmit the
data at the end of the track

760
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,038
because you can t is you would seem that
you can also then triangulate on

761
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,250
on now where that cell phone is signal
went

762
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,240
and you not only have the GPS signal may
also have the cell phone signal the

763
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,329
Kiana and again you could know the
driver cell phone number me tracking the

764
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:06,460
drivers no certain time so it's

765
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,049
hey it's not new concerns it's all it's
the same concerns that we've had

766
00:45:10,049 --> 00:45:13,390
for a while now just and different phone

767
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,078
got are is a possible to send as a
master the driver

768
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:21,670
yourself or for any other system

769
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:26,839
I don't know um I don't know how to find
out

770
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:30,609
okay and the second thing I just wanted
to add the another reason why the

771
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:33,009
drivers were protesting does GPS

772
00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:36,960
is because the no the system will be
able to else you will be able to see

773
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,009
their hours

774
00:45:38,009 --> 00:45:41,319
and there's a 12 hour limit on how long
the drive is contrasting

775
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:45,519
and the before till secret Nazi that
without the can and they just less

776
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,180
workable hours

777
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:53,629
I got it its its ban a Paul see if that
action the Commission ugly

778
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:56,759
or rule that they can you only work a
certain number of hours

779
00:45:56,759 --> 00:45:59,920
and this is just me another way of
making sure that they're

780
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,430
following the rules I'm you say that
you're not an official spokesperson for

781
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,240
the TLC

782
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,150
new may get um as a TLC taxicab driver
New York City

783
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,890
register taxicab driver you are a
eloquent spokesperson for the TLC

784
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,950
you actually hit every single talking
point that the TLC produces through all

785
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,150
of its material

786
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:24,309
that we are forced to take through all
our classes

787
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:28,029
and that most at the garages and feats
actually he

788
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:33,230
to talk about arm the answers to some
questions there aren't that the people

789
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,470
have asked me

790
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:40,460
one system is online as soon as the taxi
cab driver punches in his pin number

791
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:43,809
and that system that actual medallion
system

792
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,819
is Asia a high-speed internet connect

793
00:46:46,819 --> 00:46:50,579
yeah connection I and so each car

794
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,519
actually has its own cell phone signal
so if you go to the garage you can

795
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:56,640
actually sit there and you can start
racking

796
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,250
every single car by their GPS system or
you can start racking it through their

797
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,059
their cell phone system arm but the
other things the

798
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:08,359
Asian drivers one of the reasons why
they were protesting is because after

799
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,848
September 11th a

800
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:13,180
I've received a increase discriminate
they were as

801
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,598
and increase discrimination up against
them arm

802
00:47:16,599 --> 00:47:20,240
where taxicab drivers were actually
being pulled over out on the street

803
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,490
and being interrogated and being removed
of the job

804
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,339
they didn't want to be tracked because
they don't like to be track because they

805
00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:29,029
have

806
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:32,789
I a a disproportionate amount of
discrimination

807
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:37,000
amongst Asian taxicab drivers the one
particular site that you showed about

808
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,480
dominicans is

809
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,960
slightly incorrect because the therefore
higher

810
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,660
I I population has skew that

811
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:49,680
most taxicab drivers are from the South
East Asian continent

812
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,759
primarily from Pakistan to and India and
Afghanistan and

813
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:56,819
though there has been a very unique
trend about

814
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:00,410
increases tibetan taxicab drivers arm

815
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:04,359
one particular question to you is that
are there

816
00:48:04,359 --> 00:48:09,960
any no numa I've reports that the system
being hacked

817
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,019
I have not heard a arm

818
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:17,880
I know one percy who I their system
crashed in you know they're

819
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,589
their ride they're able to work on the
embedded Windows XP system that's behind

820
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:22,269
it

821
00:48:22,269 --> 00:48:25,440
I bass that's the only I

822
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,589
time I've known ever to happen I know
any way to

823
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:32,759
make it crash I know every way to you
pack in particular

824
00:48:32,759 --> 00:48:36,029
arm and a couple your points

825
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:39,890
that maybe this still pays you for
Kelsey I didn't close to pitch in I just

826
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,629
that I and II

827
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:46,480
I am but this is again as I said my own
research they basically said

828
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,940
on you wanna do this you find out on
your own and so this is what I came up

829
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,690
with

830
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:53,690
arm our

831
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:57,160
or thank you for being here say taxi
driver hot

832
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,460
that's good stuff arm and and one last
moment to 10 but he does when I had it

833
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,039
done

834
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,940
hackett water taxi cab driver is in the
front seat because

835
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:09,329
as soon as they log into that system I
mean one senses and goes down

836
00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:14,200
their day as fact and so if you wanna
hack it become a taxi cab driver

837
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,319
you you pay 120 dollars two hundred
fifty dollars

838
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:20,549
for 12 hours access to the cab and

839
00:49:20,549 --> 00:49:25,140
and and you know you you can then do it
yourself and and you can return the cab

840
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,249
back and say

841
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:33,249
shoots factor Mandir

842
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,769
thank you hi I'm

843
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:41,490
I've been wondering over the last few
years 2 o'clock in the morning three

844
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:44,509
o'clock in the morning have to going
back and forth back and forth

845
00:49:44,509 --> 00:49:49,170
their totally empty bus stops are packed
the buses aren't running

846
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:53,900
could there be some sort of baiting
system a light on the cap that the guys

847
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:56,009
could just take a bus class or something

848
00:49:56,009 --> 00:50:00,319
because it just seems a inefficient
marketplace at 4am

849
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,400
with people at bus stops bus is not
showing up cats going back and forth the

850
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,789
price of gas

851
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:09,630
it just seems a logical step someone is
there any city that they actually do

852
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:10,930
some server

853
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,078
free market that's is something you have
to talk to TLC

854
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,839
arm I with the evening is that good or
bad to them

855
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,599
I don't know arm I you'll have to talk
to him about it

856
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,519
I because I'm only here for DT Pepsi

857
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,759
okay so I can also do you think that
idea

858
00:50:30,759 --> 00:50:33,769
I'm good enough what happened any all

859
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,999
tanya Tate on that and get back to you

860
00:50:36,999 --> 00:50:40,109
rights so on this is a hacker conference
right some

861
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:43,740
if they're connected by sell all the
time the depending on which cell network

862
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:47,829
they are they could be going through
some kind of proxy or concentrator or

863
00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:51,180
the case have some names evils they
could be directly connected the internet

864
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,419
and you say

865
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:56,009
and then map skin would probably be
really entertaining

866
00:50:56,009 --> 00:50:59,150
has this been ready hinder minutes
anybody test this is

867
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,799
you it hasn't been hacked yet isn't
really very good response date secure

868
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:07,759
yahoo.com I haven't seen any data on
that

869
00:51:07,759 --> 00:51:10,839
get to get the IP range in yet

870
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:14,288
now %uh once a date on that I I don't
again

871
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:17,720
I asked the system's for any information
pertaining to this

872
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,999
I asked them about you know what kinda
pen testing did you do on this what

873
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:22,490
kinda

874
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:26,309
I systems are you running on backup
that's how secure is the system

875
00:51:26,309 --> 00:51:31,119
and all the other silence so you know I
I'd love to give you the answers

876
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,089
I don't happen to give I'm sorry

877
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,549
I i do like the idea of running the
taxicab for the day anything else free

878
00:51:38,549 --> 00:51:45,549
tomorrow

879
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,049
yeah

880
00:51:55,049 --> 00:51:59,599
that

881
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,510
that's how to become a taxi driver arm
because I I thought the question will

882
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,940
come up

883
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,720
arm

884
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,210
because you know at the 18th up being a
summer I'm a guy who likes a lotta

885
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:09,970
licenses

886
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,060
so I figured now I'm not really working
to the TLC I'm a consultant

887
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,890
working with the TLC I'm and yeah I
figured I might as well get my license

888
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:18,480
along here

889
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,570
so I have great myself to class the life
ins and I start the process have been

890
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,090
too lazy to finish it but

891
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:28,720
arm its relatively easy if you know the
city

892
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,160
to get hack license you just have to get
money take the casting

893
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:39,160
fast next

894
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,670
is there a fee for using credit card to
the driver

895
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:47,050
you said he is responsible for any fraud
that might happen

896
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:50,300
if if he credit card is

897
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,540
a can he I takes he eats

898
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,200
the I see that my time's up I he heats

899
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:00,340
the feet by have I'm not sure

900
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,860
if there's a it is about the UK's

901
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:09,050
credit card transaction I'll have to
look into it there you go

902
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,330
thank you very much
