1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,409
I was attacked more for on a level

2
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:06,850
are

3
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:10,920
alright

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,830
or live on tape from New York alright
welcome to the third day

5
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:24,830
i've the last hope I

6
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,220
I don't have any announcements but by
now

7
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,989
those are the best part of the show on
day other radio exam starts right now

8
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,980
to 1 o'clock but you don't it doesn't
take all three hours does a correct

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,629
now right takes about 10 minutes and
then you fail it and then you

10
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,849
you walk out and say I'll never be a ham
on ever be a ham

11
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,860
from but that is on the 6th floor

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,390
if you want to go take that exam why not
try just fill in C on everyone and see

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,219
what happens

14
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,370
and then be a real really bad ham
operator

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,780
am but there are people that have %uh
studied for it

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,630
so when I go try it out I the digital
mill

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,110
money in Copyright Act seems to be
brought up had a lot of

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,409
the whole conferences particularly
because

19
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:21,350
manual called steam fight almost all the
way to the Supreme Court

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:24,720
against a a ridiculous DMCA ruling

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,619
in the days of the Bush administration a
lot of people forget that it

22
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:32,540
it was our good buddy clinton that sign
this thing into law

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,229
I so hopefully that keep some
perspective on the differences between

24
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,450
the democrats and republicans at times

25
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,700
the DOCA has been a tough

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,530
for a lot of people I'm and to discuss
some with the

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,710
the cases and the effects on creativity

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,490
and digital culture is marcia wilbur who
flew in all the way from Phoenix this

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,180
morning

30
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:02,180
to talk to you guys about it marcia

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,610
hi okay

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,810
yeah I'm shorter hey there a

33
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:21,230
came here to experience a so images may
give you a brief overview of copyright

34
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,709
if that doesn't let you sleep then I
we're going to what is the DMCA

35
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:31,290
send a curious cases and i wanna talk
about notifications and Karen of cations

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,230
because that

37
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,149
I think it's very important that people
realize you can count on if i

38
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,159
some people didn't even realize that's
an option when I

39
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,650
you know emailed and talk to them so

40
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,400
show you how to that how to fill out at
Connors cation

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,629
so what is the NCAA

42
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:52,790
well as a we just heard

43
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,140
was passed in 1998 and its

44
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,829
an amendment to Copyright Act ways
copyright

45
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,519
well copyright is for the protection of
original works

46
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,609
expression a what happened

47
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:13,549
was copyright was for a limited amount
of time until

48
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,650
I believe the sonny bono act came about
now

49
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,230
copyright whatever you write down its
copy written

50
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,730
its you don't need to register it you
don't have to send it to the Copyright

51
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,650
Office it's considered copyright

52
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,910
it was directed to promote their
progression up a

53
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,970
Arts and Sciences and a lot of things
that we've seen is that it's

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,880
actually inhibiting the arts and
sciences but how do you prove fact

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,168
it was originally it was previously
known as the act for the encouragement

56
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,410
learning but does it really restricted
encouragement

57
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,730
learning today writer whose copyright

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,450
the creator the copyright to check
creators

59
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,900
if you do work for hire situation I your
employer can own the copyright

60
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,139
agencies okay so I don't know I

61
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:15,709
if you've heard of public domain but
that's where I

62
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,620
materials are accessible they're free to
use Download

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,969
and government documents are considered
public domain

64
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:30,890
and then there's orphan works you're
looking for the person who owns the

65
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:31,669
document

66
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,729
he can't find that person so what
happens you try to use document and then

67
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:37,599
all of a sudden

68
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,659
the owner appears what do you do in that
situation that

69
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:43,780
that's a tough one so a lot of times
people

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,419
they don't wanna use orphan works
because their frayed

71
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,419
four factors a fair use

72
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,450
well they're supposed to be fair use but

73
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,590
these are the four factors it can damage
the market for the owner

74
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,230
it depends what portion of the work you
years and

75
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,710
wire using the work and the nature

76
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,789
that covered workers considered out

77
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:21,980
oh and going backwards I'm sorry I was
telling Greg earlier I'm not used to

78
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,000
addressing an audience that picket signs

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,090
so please bear with me maybe I should

80
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,400
got a little bit more about myself
before I go on but that boring

81
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,669
margins are copyright on I

82
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:39,549
I i have did an internship with the Free
Software Foundation

83
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,040
I was part of the digital speech project
I'm

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,200
I was a committee member there I've
worked with Daniel are on drafting

85
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,330
the effi- I DMCA

86
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,169
Africa and ask questions I attended

87
00:05:55,169 --> 00:05:58,969
the First UMC a protest a with search
their

88
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,500
I am I've been to rallies and

89
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,530
you know pretty much I followed
copyright as that my

90
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,210
little hobby and so

91
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,120
I'm not a liar I and II II

92
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,190
so this is just a

93
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,590
kinda new to me an

94
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,380
at any rate cover it was implemented

95
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,539
for censorship reasons which is
interesting because today

96
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,289
a it's being used I believe for
censorship

97
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:40,219
in 1946 the United States copyright

98
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,380
I lot only had 11,000 550 words

99
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,590
and as you can see by the year two
thousand we have

100
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,060
almost over ten times as much with
124,000 320 words

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,470
no I did not read every single word and
count them

102
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,520
hot

103
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,520
yeah thats copyright laws there are
other laws

104
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,950
I regarding copyright the audio home
recording act

105
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,560
I and other computing lies and that

106
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,250
we believe the DMCA conflicts where at
for instance you have the communication

107
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,849
active 1934

108
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,950
this was an interesting case with
Charter Communications

109
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,090
where at the RIAA requested some
subpoenas

110
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,460
out 150 ovum or and you know II

111
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,409
to get information on the user's well
actually

112
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:39,610
the DMCA comfort subpoena section
conflicted with the communications Act

113
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,150
of 1934

114
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:47,580
and they did not get the subpoenas it
also conflicts with the first amendment

115
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,099
free speech in rights and

116
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:55,909
the teacher act because the DMCA doesn't
allowed digitizing analog

117
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:59,580
teach teach act allows limited him out

118
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,430
but each act is the art technology
education and copyright harmonization

119
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,419
act mostly used for distance education

120
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:10,900
whips

121
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,150
anti circumvention

122
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,659
copyright fair use derivative works safe
harbor

123
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,500
they're all areas reverse engineering K

124
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,380
no person shall circumvent a
technological measure that effectively

125
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,030
controls

126
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,750
access to work so what can be considered
a protected work

127
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,429
literary works

128
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,860
music

129
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,310
drama pantomimes graphics

130
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,310
motion pictures and sound recordings
architectural designs

131
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,830
so this means no one can manufacture and
poor

132
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,400
offer to the public provide traffic in
any product service technology advisor

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,110
confront other

134
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,570
a technical a

135
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,000
technological measure effectively
control access to work if the measure

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,320
well you can be that in the ordinary
course service operation requires an

137
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,050
application have

138
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,160
information process treatment okay

139
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,319
so to circumvent a technological measure
is to scramble

140
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,380
the crypt avoid

141
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:34,110
bypass remove deactivate impair
technological measure

142
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,970
without the authority over copyright
owner but what

143
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,610
is technology a wooden spoon can be seen
as technology

144
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,940
technology can be

145
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,310
anything that makes our lives better
paper

146
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:53,950
trains at in the sport example

147
00:09:53,950 --> 00:10:00,950
splaine's expansion for arm so we don't
burn ourselves so

148
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,730
now move out some the cases with DCSS

149
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,490
several suits were filed maybe I can get
into

150
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,960
how I got involved in this I DCSS think
first went to the 2600 sight to see how

151
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,890
kevin was done

152
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,970
for Kevin campaign when I saw this open
DVD .org

153
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,320
and I said oh what's this and I learned
a little bit more about it

154
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,860
I joined a couple unless sad the Berkman
Center

155
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,710
had a list for DVD II DCS ass

156
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,880
and it went on from there

157
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,580
but the suits that were filed where
against 2600

158
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,910
2600 Connecticut which was at Jeremiah
at German issues I don't know

159
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,819
here he told me he's trying to go on the
internet and

160
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,990
and become a little bit more not a mess
so you can get a real job

161
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:00,030
I seventy two individuals in web sites
claiming CSS as a trade secret

162
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:07,030
and of course John Johansson do you all
know it dcfs is they really need to get

163
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,190
into this case I think

164
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,090
you know do do you know your have
raising hands who knows what the CSS was

165
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:16,430
okay this guy ask

166
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,600
d

167
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,830
DCSS I let's see it was

168
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,400
a Heather it's a CSS the Scrambler

169
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,050
so what how do you how do you say d at
D's

170
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:38,050
ok you remember okay so the challenge
was there was interest diction and a CSS

171
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:42,260
to circumvent it was in one of the
exceptions

172
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,630
and the 1201 was unconstitutional here's
our results

173
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:50,330
Jan Johansson was cleared of charges in
January of 2003

174
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,740
2600 lost appealed loss and decided not
to go on to the Supreme Court

175
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,810
there were protests and mir's

176
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,960
DCSS was everywhere at that point

177
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,810
we're it really did have a positive
outcome in the DVD

178
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,920
back or I'm sorry David ECCA

179
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,800
purses banner and the California inc.-ca
precourt

180
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,980
dismissed the claims because

181
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,770
DC Dez it was in a trade secret because
the CSS was available

182
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:28,180
so anyone everyone thanks for sharing

183
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,980
appreciate it I

184
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,830
in the Pavlov its case it to

185
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,580
was dismissed based on jurisdiction
Pavlovich lived in Texas

186
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,700
they filed that paperwork in California

187
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,090
it really was a landmark case for
jurisdiction rose on the Internet

188
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,310
so that's another good outcome that came
about because %uh vez

189
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,260
and from the 2600 site

190
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,670
it says people the world over know now
about

191
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,380
or know all about the DMCA and are
committed to overturning it

192
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,080
the amount of education that has
occurred in the last two and a half

193
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,790
years is simply phenomenal

194
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,240
there are many other combatants now in
the fight and we will NEVER

195
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,240
we have never been more convinced that
we will ultimately prevail

196
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,170
in the year 2000 we had a protest

197
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,550
and people didn't know what the DMCA
West today

198
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,860
people they know about it they've heard
about it some people don't have correct

199
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,180
information

200
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,570
but at least they know about it and
their they don't like it

201
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,760
and they're doing something about it

202
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,189
so we have some pictures from the first
protest says David

203
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,380
me Isaac how you pronounce his name

204
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,770
me me he's the organizer for the first
protest

205
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:56,030
I this was held in Washington DC

206
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,439
it was also I have first pet some more
people showed up

207
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,500
and how should change a tire

208
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:10,230
and there's Timothy lowered some other
people talking to people but the DMCA

209
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,100
K for certain items that can be used for
circumvention

210
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,400
which of the following items is not
considered considered a circumvention

211
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,110
device

212
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:26,570
shifty a magic marker

213
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:32,610
staple remover screwdriver

214
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,880
there was a case with the shifty where
that student who

215
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,350
bypassed at from Dr and cap protection

216
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,380
scheme is shifty and he actually
received a DMCA notification

217
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:51,080
which was later revoked

218
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,390
a he I don't know he is the shift key to
bypass

219
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,370
the yeah he pressed it I

220
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:05,370
that's a good answer

221
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:10,310
bypass gotta run back

222
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,410
is that your is a really considered a
violation a flaw

223
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,189
II didn't know that

224
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,800
other cases we have our at major square
off the russian photographer

225
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,530
I'm you talk to you today about the leet

226
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,760
and Star Wars charter actually I'm going

227
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,459
I'm not going today Diebold I'm going to
Verizon

228
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:37,280
on Asher case Walmart FatWallet

229
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,000
games by and you to you there so many
cases now

230
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,280
I'm back in the year 2000 there were
just a handful cases but today

231
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,110
you can go on there you there are so
many cases to keep up with

232
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,250
its unbelievable

233
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:00,250
so and Demetrius case he bypass route 13

234
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,640
I don't know who the program I was told
Adobe that this was a good encryption

235
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,150
and how much he got paid for their but

236
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,490
I would have liked to have been on that
payroll

237
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,330
he worked at welcome soft in Russia

238
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:26,250
he gave a presentation at def comin he
was arrested there was

239
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,730
a lot there were a lot of protests I
mean there were protests

240
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,940
even in Russia there were protests in

241
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,280
California New Mexico Arizona

242
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,670
attacks s New York all over

243
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,340
I at first the effect was saying that
they were hoping to get some kind of

244
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,030
negotiations going with Adobe

245
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:50,270
but actually it was the FBI who had
arrested Dmitry and at that point

246
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,670
we really didn't believe that the Adobe

247
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,600
had any say in what was gonna happen so
we continued with our protests

248
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,470
so what happened

249
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,000
the charges where he was arrested for
distribution of a product that

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,710
circumvents copy protection

251
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:14,710
and eventually the charges were dropped

252
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,790
have to have the representation here
alright so we have a leak speak trailer

253
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,199
Lucasfilm George Lucas does not want you
to use

254
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,500
anything having to do with Star Wars

255
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,720
you will receive a DMCA notification

256
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,020
its unbelievable how many people

257
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,810
that i've seen. receive look I mean
scientology would-be like

258
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,990
the one above Lucas but

259
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:51,190
at any rate in the fashion George Lucas
I mark received at DMCA notification

260
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:56,120
for his lead speak trailer which I
believe you can look at you too

261
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,290
if you go to that site its kinda funny

262
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,740
so

263
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:06,550
from his account was he he was his a

264
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,720
he found out about the CNT when

265
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,840
his service was suspended which is
really nice because now your service is

266
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,560
suspended

267
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,600
you get it did you find out all you had
a DMCA notification

268
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,790
what do I do I want my service back
right

269
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,159
I need that so what he did was

270
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,800
he told the host that would remove all
the question over materials

271
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,050
and he also sent a response to Lucas but

272
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,389
thing he never heard from them oh yeah
the core ABC i wanna talk to about this

273
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,850
this was more recent case where

274
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,930
alan is soda he a

275
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,680
she was by Care Project what he did was
he create patches so

276
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,900
people could use Corey BC Analects and

277
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,090
basically he posted his

278
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,129
you know patches in his information to
the Empire last

279
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,930
going back again so

280
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,760
he was hoping that you know employer
would

281
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,379
pick it up put in the code you know but

282
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,990
on they never did he kept working on it
and there was a guy

283
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,740
in the last called beta but baby boy who
he believes worked for core ABC

284
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,770
so you know he made patches to new
versions

285
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,980
they didn't at his patches to the kobe
so he started

286
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,660
their core ABC for Linux on Google
included

287
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,940
you know patches and voter code

288
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,440
so eventually what if 64-bit your server
app for that

289
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,800
here isn't up the middle love creating a
patch for the new 1.7

290
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,700
when he received project take down from
Google

291
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,820
basically this notification said that he
had court

292
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:56,860
ABC on his website which he did not a

293
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,030
according to him so

294
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,590
he only had on there was at

295
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,929
the core EPC for 1x which was that code
from mplayer

296
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,260
anything under the GPL and it was
distributed appropriately

297
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,270
he actually said that by he encourage
people to buy the full version

298
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,550
of Korea BC because he's up for the
fifteen dollars that they got

299
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,480
it was a good deal and he wrote his sack
his patches

300
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,340
to go with that so he said Google was
really helpful

301
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,980
I Google overseas a lot of Cindy's

302
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,800
they were helpful they advise him of his
rights they put

303
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,750
his notification on showing a fax and
allowed him to

304
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,360
verify the contact have have any have
you heard of telling a fax

305
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,560
have any how many have heard yet its

306
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:51,760
a really good repository for information
on the DMCA copyright

307
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,970
it was started by Wendy seltzer on crew
is

308
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,400
who I know she still works for the FF
but now she's a professor now

309
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,840
on its it's a really if you're
interested in copyright law or

310
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,260
even like add domain names any kind of
law

311
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,870
I regarding computing it's a really good
site to get here

312
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:18,300
at a rate Cooper recommended that he
filed a counterclaim but it said not to

313
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,160
he found out from the mailing list that
there was that may be an interest in

314
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,110
negotiating

315
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,810
with core ABC and

316
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,940
there to complaints where that he is
that trademark

317
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,679
which is not a DMCA issue and the
reverse engineered

318
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,870
so in his understanding

319
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,590
reverse engineering for the purpose of
interoperability was okay

320
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:46,100
basically he ended up signing a request

321
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,770
back to Korea BC to reverse engineer and
use their trademark

322
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:56,770
it was granted and in this case there
was a positive outcome

323
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:01,410
circumvention is usually required for
reverse engineering

324
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:05,990
and it prevents reverse engineering have
measures that control copyright

325
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:09,020
control access to cover at work but
there's an exception

326
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,460
now computer programs

327
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,440
ok I'm sorry

328
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,520
okay in order to reverse engineer
program

329
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,500
in most cases you would need to
circumvent or bypassed some kind

330
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:33,500
love protection that they've put in
there

331
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,800
okay computer programs can be
reverse-engineered

332
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,010
if you lawfully obtained program

333
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:46,490
so the campfire at program and then

334
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:52,260
ask for permission to reverse engineer
it it's just not going to be good

335
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:57,310
I engineer at the river seine here six
permission from the copyright owner what

336
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,690
I thought was interesting about this was

337
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,000
it says six permission it doesn't
actually say granted

338
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,090
but you know rethinking maybe

339
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,740
that's part of it I you use the results
to create an interoperable computer

340
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,740
program

341
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,679
you do not publish the results

342
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:21,770
the final program must interoperate with
software

343
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:27,260
and not with protected content like
media

344
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,140
so from chewing affects reverse
engineers must carefully consider their

345
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,250
planned work

346
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,460
whether it fits into the exception
because this exception is far too narrow

347
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:42,210
to be useful

348
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,800
k so here we are again at the Charter
Communications case

349
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,100
RAAA wanted the names on

350
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,110
charter went to court and the result was

351
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:56,700
that the raha are a RIAA cannot

352
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,740
use pre litigation DMCA pits subpoenas

353
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,490
that means if there is in the case they
can't get a subpoena

354
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,669
according to this

355
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:13,300
decision object

356
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,950
well the IRA is the recording industry

357
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,890
Association of America ray and they're
the ones

358
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:27,760
word yeah I we're using p2p services to
download music or share music

359
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,840
sure

360
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:40,840
right because you can't get a subpoena
unless you actually have a case

361
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:49,280
right yeah sure but if they don't know
where you are

362
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,120
the pre litigations against well they're
being used to get information on users

363
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,230
who are allegedly violating

364
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,910
and the copyright law I shouldn't really
say that

365
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,020
that users who are downloading and
sharing music

366
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,250
using peer to peer services because

367
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:21,150
okay a scar oh yeah

368
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:27,320
that's good for us the RIAA requested

369
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,700
the identity of one user according to
Verizon case

370
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:34,650
the alleged back casa has a cover I

371
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,310
rising refused the DC district court
granted

372
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,710
the subpoena but the circuit court of
appeals

373
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:44,750
agree with Verizon and prostate

374
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,620
so we have a case a

375
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,860
a sysadmin working at a university here

376
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,390
who we received ac&e notice

377
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,300
from the RIAA he

378
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,150
searches for the information because
this notice is invalid

379
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:06,400
it does not specify what files

380
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,980
are in violation of the DMCA they really
didn't need

381
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,700
to pursue it because it said invalid
notification

382
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,050
but they did it was considered a
priority issue and the Astronomy

383
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:21,690
Department

384
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,380
he searched they they couldn't find
anything

385
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:30,100
he

386
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,090
I asked him how much time it took him to
realize that it was professor our shows

387
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:35,620
file which was a question and he said
that

388
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,990
he still not sure but it was profession
professor professor Asher's content that

389
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,140
sparked it all

390
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:49,140
he says he doesn't know how the archer
reference camp out and he had never

391
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,090
heard of Asher

392
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,220
and in his final comments he said

393
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,930
I realize this was a blunder on the part
of the RIAA

394
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,740
the RAAS PR person told him that

395
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,580
10 had made the mistake I

396
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,439
basically what I liked about what he
said was the DMCA fails when it puts

397
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,100
enforcement in the hands of the
Copyright owner and set up a central

398
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:19,730
governing judicial body I can imagine
how much time

399
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,380
the school spent looking for this file
that wasn't even there

400
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,770
and says the RIAs carelessness in cases
like this is a solid reason while there

401
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:31,990
needs to be some 42

402
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,210
former impartial intervention before
notices are sent off

403
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,990
but actually if you get an invalid
notification

404
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:44,750
you really have to go this far but the
school did

405
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:48,760
there's another student

406
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,390
daniel Paille pissy and a posse and I
don't know how to say his name

407
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,990
but he did a parody first class project
on the Walmart Foundation

408
00:27:56,990 --> 00:28:03,990
and his ISP received a DMCA notification
I told them that I felt the fear that

409
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,110
comes with getting a DMCA notification
cuz I once received an invalid one

410
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,970
myself

411
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,170
and he told me that he was scared

412
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,850
and it was only the support from their
public interest lawyers and unions and

413
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:20,170
the general public

414
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:25,400
that made him feel OK and asked him if
he thought that

415
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,540
the site was within the bounds a fair
use and you could certainly

416
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,310
it's a parody it wouldn't be legal if
you use the a

417
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:37,450
website as a model for charity but to
make a social and political commentary

418
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,950
on Walmart

419
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:45,220
is speech asked if you make a counter
notification

420
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,470
he said no he hadn't and this happens in
a lotta cases

421
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,700
Karen notifications are now files he
said his best advice is to publicize the

422
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,900
cease and desist

423
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,340
and public support and attention can
never hurt

424
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:04,450
I'll right

425
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,930
exactly when you

426
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,080
okay

427
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,409
yeah I will have a question and answer
section at the end

428
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,400
if if you can if people have questions
they can come in one of the Mikes

429
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,400
in them center aisle

430
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,770
after after speaker would prefer rights

431
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,260
K for Hicks

432
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,620
so fat wallet is a site where people get
information

433
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,620
on deals I'm offer deals I'm

434
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,360
like I do couponing I caught hacking for
groceries

435
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,760
go in there it on my coupons and get
like 100 dollars grocers for like five

436
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,900
bucks

437
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:49,660
and I think in this day and age

438
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,750
you know why not save money so far well
as an awesome place to go

439
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,220
to get deals well

440
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,240
FatWallet received some DMCA
notifications to take down prices that

441
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,430
were listed for Black Friday

442
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:07,320
black Friday is that big sale after
Thanksgiving where you can get a lot of

443
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,600
good deals

444
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,730
and wal-mart's filed for subpoena and

445
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,610
FatWallet said prices are not
copyrighted

446
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,530
Fairfax so they went in you no threat to
say oh

447
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:26,530
Walmart back Walmart back down and I
believe FatWallet pursuit Best Buy

448
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,950
hearing the case have jurisdiction

449
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:34,880
game spies and online multi-player
service provide

450
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,120
a gaming service provider they sent
Luigi

451
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,210
re: Mia are can't pronounce his name is
are

452
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,790
or is ever easy and Italian hacker

453
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:48,629
a cease and desist letter and they asked
him to remove

454
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:55,210
advisories you utilities and
vulnerabilities

455
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,940
the CMD specifically talked about the
DMCA

456
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,670
the computer fried and abuse act and the
Lanham Act and trademark issues

457
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:07,010
or abuse but what I thought was
interesting was in this

458
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:10,020
notification they listed the amount of
money

459
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,620
they wanted from the region

460
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,680
I'd actually like to take a look at that
notification

461
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,850
ask him if he made a counter
notification

462
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:29,260
said he never heard of it

463
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:33,240
civil mister but

464
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,490
is this another DMCA violator I don't
know if you see this movie

465
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:41,160
but in this moving Wiley well

466
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,980
records audio from a movie he our guys
it

467
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:51,550
for future use any shares his DRM
cracked music with his friend

468
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,810
he watches on his iPod but hello dolly

469
00:31:54,810 --> 00:32:00,429
is not available through the iTunes
Store

470
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,610
I got this from Jeff I just the way life

471
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,770
his website president bush

472
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,460
he received an iPod that had music that
the beatles on it

473
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,460
not available through the iTunes Store

474
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,840
so I want to get into the Second Life
thing because I know second life has

475
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,710
been having a lot of DMCA issues and
some people like to

476
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,140
gonna go in there and create spaces in
clothing and

477
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,520
whatever else I i've I've been in there
a couple times but

478
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,600
on this is from the FAQ

479
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,210
can I sign notifications and Kateryna
notifications with my second life

480
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:50,570
avatar name no these are

481
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:55,260
real documents you need to use your real

482
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,679
world name can you change the DMCA
process

483
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,450
don't I wish we could

484
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,419
but unfortunate way now

485
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:15,799
they cannot now

486
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,350
you too has been in the news lately

487
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,390
a lot people use YouTube I really like
you too

488
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,669
because you can create your own media we
don't need to look at

489
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:30,200
purchase media anymore there's

490
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,120
shows on their laxative interesting
things

491
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,419
I but you to have received

492
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:41,230
well by coming to court against YouTube

493
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,320
and what happened with the motion was
granted

494
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,850
all usernames I P addresses and videos
viewed

495
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,870
were given to viacom at

496
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:58,539
serious privacy concern but the judge
said it was merely speculative

497
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:02,820
so I don't know what they're gonna do
with all that information

498
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,819
but they got they got it

499
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:22,019
so when sony's copy proof protection for
CDs were defeated with the magic marker

500
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,039
grantgross pointed out that

501
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,839
CNN routers Yahoo and other news sources

502
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:33,940
that linked to that information we're
sharing

503
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,879
the information and were actually

504
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,929
in violation in his opinion himself

505
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,399
and in the 2600 case the New York Times
actually

506
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,598
links to where the DS DCSS was

507
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,599
so where they considered a violator as
well snag it back on a topic I have

508
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,299
subpoenas

509
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:01,200
a speed as the core order that must be
supported by a case

510
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:07,660
or controversy at the time issuance if I
lakes privacy protection

511
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:14,660
for cable subscribers and first
amendment rights

512
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,280
with reverse engineering you have to be
very careful

513
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,040
is a reverse engineering is it designed
fact

514
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:32,040
where is the line now my favorite people

515
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,220
the DMCA agents themselves usually
people who work in an organization who

516
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:37,830
were told

517
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:40,890
your our DMCA agent arm

518
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,848
they handle notifications Katter
notifications

519
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:50,280
according to the law there's a list of
DMCA agents if you need to reach one for

520
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,470
some reason

521
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:54,580
I it's available at copyright ACA have

522
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,540
so

523
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,910
Go Daddy I don't know if you've heard of
this a service

524
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,170
it now has over nine million domains

525
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,820
and they receive DMCA notifications

526
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:14,270
I according to their policy the site is
taken down as soon as they get a DMCA

527
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,200
notification

528
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,960
a from what I read in the law I didn't
say anything about that

529
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,530
I did say that they have to respond

530
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,190
by bring the site back up within 10 to
14 days

531
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,680
with a counter notification it could be
part of their agreement

532
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,680
so when you have an agreement with a
nice care service provider

533
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,799
make sure you read it over to see you
know

534
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,820
what with the stipulations are

535
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,150
said they didn't get a lot a counter
notifications

536
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:50,430
because people would rather not have
their sights down for any extended

537
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,569
amount of time

538
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:58,570
so they usually just comply now you
answer the notifications

539
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,109
part of this priest presentation a

540
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:11,750
okay so the notification has to have a
physical or electronic signature

541
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,380
a person authorized to act on behalf
have the copyright owner

542
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,780
asked to identify

543
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,359
the work if there are multiple listings
you know

544
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,020
things that they want taken down they
can to say and all the rest of it

545
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:34,020
hasta actually be specific

546
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,970
the information has to be reasonably
sufficient for the service provider to

547
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,740
actually locate the material to
determine if the content is present

548
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:52,570
and to remove disable the access to the
allegedly infringing materials

549
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:59,570
you have the contact information if the
person filing the notification

550
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:05,650
your address or phone number email
address and they have to sign a

551
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,760
statement of good faith

552
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,790
and a statement under par

553
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:15,400
penalty of perjury which is really
interesting

554
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,450
do you get a copy

555
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:26,360
yes if for some reason you were to
receive a DMCA notification

556
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,540
you should get a copy according to the
law it says

557
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,640
the service provider must supply you
with prompt notification and a chance to

558
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,330
respond

559
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,340
so make sure your contact information is
current

560
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:44,660
so you can receive that copy so

561
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,390
here's a case OVA Comcast user

562
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:52,200
who receive a notification from I
Comcast regarding

563
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,320
bit torrent use he had a partial copy of
the movie Scarface

564
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,430
what should he do reply to the email

565
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:07,379
remove the partial copy counter notify

566
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,940
sent an email saying say hello to my
little friend

567
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,960
he this is an actual case the guy had no
idea

568
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,640
what he should do well

569
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,850
after three violations apparently
Comcast I deny service

570
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:30,150
so be sure to read your agreement you
signed find alternative means to watch

571
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,920
media

572
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:37,920
in don't share the partial amount
another section of the DM say that you

573
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,840
might want to know about is at
misrepresentation

574
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,630
knowing that material a is

575
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:49,320
not infringing and sending a DMCA
notification

576
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:55,070
is considered misrepresentation if you
get a DMCA notification

577
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,860
it's not valid you counter notify and
your claim

578
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:05,000
a substantial if debt party send you
another notification

579
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,520
on the same material that's considered
knowingly misrepresenting

580
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,780
and you could sell this happened with 20
seltzer in the NFL

581
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,390
she posted I the NFL's copyright blurb

582
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,770
at the began on YouTube and

583
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,670
she got it DMCA notification she filed a
counter notification

584
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,740
and it was considered that that was not
infringing materials

585
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:37,740
and the NFL Center another notification

586
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,500
so again there's a case of invalid
notifications

587
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,750
and if the ISP sends you nothing

588
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,869
then you don't have to do anything if
the ISP sensing something and chest and

589
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:54,740
your service

590
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,810
then sent a letter to the ISP informing
them that the notification is invalid

591
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,290
most ISP's DMCA agents

592
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:05,869
today know and realize that these are
not

593
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:09,990
valid and want purcell however

594
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:16,849
there could be a case where they do so
your counter notification

595
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,849
would be the letter that use and to the
ISP

596
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:23,900
stating that the materials amor

597
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,650
a where that that you are

598
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:32,869
that you didn't do

599
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:36,550
covering for Jim okay

600
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,390
so the ISP is required to resume service
within 10 to 14 business days

601
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:45,410
after they receive your counter
notification and it's found that you did

602
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,629
not infringe materials

603
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,000
unless the complainant

604
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,619
has filed a restraining order and

605
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,940
if they're

606
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,130
complaining his father restraining order
than the ask his hands are tied

607
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,359
so you need to provide an

608
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,060
reading by fax or snail mail which I
know it's really

609
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:14,040
sometimes difficult on to go to the post
office

610
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:19,759
get a stamp and Center your name your
phone number your email address

611
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,569
the material alleged as infringing that
was removed

612
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:26,930
where is not valid on

613
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:33,618
the reason for disabled access a
statement that you consent

614
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:37,240
to the jurisdiction of federal core in
which you live

615
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,900
if you live outside the US it would be
Delaware County Pennsylvania DC

616
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,990
II you accept service if

617
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,099
process from the complainants and

618
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,770
of course here's another I penalty of
perjury

619
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:59,369
statement that your sign I swear under
penalty of perjury I have good faith

620
00:42:59,369 --> 00:42:59,990
belief that

621
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:03,839
each imager article was removed or
disabled as a result of a mistake or

622
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,450
misidentification

623
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:09,980
sign it you send it out

624
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,660
chilling effects has a generated Karen
notification

625
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,970
so you can go in there and you can fill
out your information

626
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:25,970
and it will generate one for you I
wanted to talk a little bit about the

627
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,690
exemptions

628
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,440
I'm examine the exemptions to the DMCA
inferred list serve internet locations

629
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,250
this is so they can collect that
information for sensor where

630
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:44,190
in my opinion I but it's pretty much
like the phone book

631
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:49,270
you cannot copyright you know all the
names and addresses and phone book

632
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,400
you can copy write the method you use to
organize them

633
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,369
but really you really can't computer
programs protected by dollars that

634
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,460
prevent access

635
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,210
that are obsolete there are no longer
being manufactured

636
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,579
you can go to town with us a

637
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:11,000
computer programs & video games
distributed in obsolete formats have fun

638
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:18,000
literary works for eBook format which
this was a really good

639
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:22,779
when here for the blind so this

640
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:26,560
this allows that when the existing
addition

641
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,680
after work contains access controls that
prevent

642
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,118
enabling the read-aloud feature I

643
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,890
there's an exemption to that you can

644
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,848
have fun with that so during the next
three years

645
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,680
the provi- prohibition against
circumvention I

646
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,578
shall not apply to persons who engage in
non infringing uses

647
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,599
audiovisual works included in the
educational library over colleges

648
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,040
or universities fillmore Media Studies
department

649
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,220
where and the circumvention is used for
the purpose a a

650
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:08,339
the work for education

651
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:15,339
sound recordings I

652
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:23,900
okay other questions sir now

653
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:32,600
your questions 0 search please

654
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,500
sewing so

655
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,510
in 2003 I believe

656
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,470
Virginia congresspeople was introducing
a bill that was going to create fair use

657
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:47,299
exception

658
00:45:47,299 --> 00:45:51,220
since we can't defeat the DMCA there's
no there's no point intended to repeal

659
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:51,599
it

660
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,640
the no support would be through amongst
the

661
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,180
large studios would be too much lobbying
effort the attempt was to create

662
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,740
exceptions by here extension a fair use

663
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,740
I haven't heard anything from about that

664
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,559
effort since then a warning if the
effect for the

665
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,970
FSF in the on any

666
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,000
working in 2008 coalition not only love
organizations

667
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,539
legal organizations but also Google
another

668
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:25,369
large ISP's who this cost real money to
to handle

669
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:28,660
you there's a coalition of people
working to reintroduce that bill

670
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,098
since the since that time yeah I'm

671
00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:35,740
I'm not really sure about what's going
on I know that

672
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,000
although we were working on that digital
speech project

673
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,510
back in 2002-2003 it went by the wayside

674
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,099
and they're really and we were working
on toward

675
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:52,520
towards working with people from the
EFSF Cory Doctorow was part of that

676
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,509
project

677
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:56,799
and we're trying to work and in hand

678
00:46:56,799 --> 00:47:01,099
on doing something but it fell by the
wayside and I really don't know if

679
00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:04,329
they're doing anything these days with
regard to that

680
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:08,920
I'm sorry I had a question

681
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,349
where the slides and it was talkin

682
00:47:12,349 --> 00:47:17,420
sent fair use

683
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:22,049
it was very specific to film professors
and colleges and universities

684
00:47:22,049 --> 00:47:25,720
does that mean that doesn't apply to K
12 education

685
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,869
and or it doesn't apply to

686
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,579
other subject areas besides Film Studies
Film and Media Studies

687
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,980
well I know that the teacher act allows

688
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,589
a lot it back with education

689
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:42,869
when it comes to K through 12 yr
University the

690
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:46,089
technology education cover a
harmonization act is

691
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:50,130
more are specific and what can be done

692
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:54,130
with regards to copyright it said very
good

693
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,289
for education here's a think

694
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:01,339
when you have environment I don't know
if you're talking about an online

695
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:03,140
learning environment or

696
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,759
just an face to face classroom
environment in education

697
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,440
but when using digital materials and
then online environment for education

698
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,240
the access is supposed to be restricted
to only those classroom users

699
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,430
and what happens then how does the
copyright owner even know you're using

700
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:23,058
their material at that point

701
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:26,980
it's really up to the you know
universities or schools

702
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,910
to make that decision with regards to

703
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:34,359
using media you can convert a certain
amount love

704
00:48:34,359 --> 00:48:39,109
media from analog to digital I think you
might miss it okay I'm sorry but my

705
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:40,490
question had to do with the fact that

706
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,609
in that slide you presented how language
is very specific

707
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:48,420
right answer City professors right and
in specifically

708
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,900
professors who subject area its film
studies right so I'm

709
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:56,559
my question was was at particular in the
sense that that's too that

710
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:59,670
only a few ask you as far as I can
understand it

711
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,829
only applies to them but you could have
some teach

712
00:49:02,829 --> 00:49:07,109
you could use the teach act for your
needs if you have other needs but yes

713
00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:11,720
it seems that according to the DMCA that
exemption is specific to those people

714
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:15,470
thanks

715
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:19,839
way before there was the DMCA there is a
organization called the Gutenberg

716
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:20,410
Project

717
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:23,819
and what they do is they take and log
books %uh literature

718
00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:27,349
and turn them into electronic eBook text
form

719
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:30,380
how and they're still going on today
even though there's the DMCA

720
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,609
and now that we have things like the
Sony e-reader and Amazon dot com scandal

721
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:38,339
you can now turn an entire analog
library

722
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:42,828
into a single electronic device how does
the DMCA apply to both the Gutenberg

723
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:43,490
Project

724
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:46,529
an individual converting an analog

725
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:51,279
paper and ebook and using a photo
scanner some other

726
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,849
method turn that into an ebook help
legal is that

727
00:49:54,849 --> 00:49:58,420
well is Greg still here

728
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,119
actually Craig Newby who at his computer
I'm using I believe

729
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:06,460
is part of that group for project I

730
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:10,869
with with e-books

731
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:14,750
yayyy this is the problem you're using
it

732
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,730
where did you go 0 okay so I can try to
understand your question

733
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,520
are you saying we can't I can you scan a
book that's copyrighted

734
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:26,339
and put it in eBook format is that what
is that the question

735
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:30,960
yeah pretty much okay I'm not a liar and
some not giving you advice

736
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,779
I'm just but I would say yeah that's
probably not a good idea just because

737
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:37,029
I'm pretty sure that's frowned upon

738
00:50:37,029 --> 00:50:40,900
but I'm not understanding why Gutenberg
Project is not are they using public

739
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,730
domain

740
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,279
yes okay their young public domain
materials that is available to the

741
00:50:45,279 --> 00:50:46,930
public to use and share

742
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:51,770
and have fun with so I believe that's
why they can do that

743
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:54,819
I know there were other projects back in
their late 90's

744
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:58,180
that people were scanning an entire
books that were not

745
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,200
copyrighted I mean we're not public
domain they were copyrighted

746
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,760
and and I think some of those places got
into a little bit trouble for that

747
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,990
and are no longer in existence

748
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,410
thanks um what I'm sorry I can take one
more question

749
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,500
thank you it is just a real brief
comment the

750
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,260
question about fair use actually work
for a nonprofit that studies

751
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,480
record promotes remixes and remixers as
coffee makes America

752
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,609
an American University two weeks ago
announce more less the guidelines

753
00:51:26,609 --> 00:51:30,150
from the center for social media that
says fair use is anything that its

754
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,270
non-commercial

755
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:34,290
its transformative are and its the

756
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:38,020
about political speech were released
within the context it is about speech

757
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,980
rain and that is the definition of what
is fair use and that is what's being

758
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,660
defined right now for fair use

759
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,160
for the individual who had a question
just for your information okay thank you

760
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,970
thank you well thanks all for being with
me on this

761
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:55,809
presentation and I hope you learn
something again if you

762
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:59,790
you know you need any information about
copyright there's always the World Wide

763
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:00,410
Web

764
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,960
and hopefully I go to a reliable source
like chilling fact for the FF

765
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,520
thanks

766
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,050

intersection of culture jamming hacking

767
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:15,170
and hacktivism

768
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:15,930
in just a few moments
