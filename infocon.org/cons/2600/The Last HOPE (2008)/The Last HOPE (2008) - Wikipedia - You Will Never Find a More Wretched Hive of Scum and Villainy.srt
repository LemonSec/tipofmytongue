good to us and they allow us to come

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,590

9
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:37,030
four-year downstairs in the lobby and we
offer the tape to put over the airports

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,609

11
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,610

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm and again keep things outside the
hotel cuz they

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,390

18
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,229
and do down in the pavilion

19
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:10,539
I'm downstairs also for the people that
sorta congregate in the very back

20
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,890
if you could keep from my speaking and
talking and socializing back there

21
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,560
as it does dressed up here on this is a
conference room and not sort of a social

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,600
areas so

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,220
arm see if you can keep it down back
there so as not to

24
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,390
disturb people I am DVD sales of all the
talks are

25

27
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,009
right now there's a discussion called a
solar compass for the human domain

28
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,369
right now we're gonna get to I'll
Wikipedia

29
00:01:45,369 --> 00:01:50,830
which people love to change in vandalize
on a daily basis this is called

30
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,750
Wikipedia

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,819
you'll never find a more wretched hive
of scum and villainy

32
00:01:54,819 --> 00:02:01,359
with virtual graphics

33
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,270
hi okay on too high I'm fertile

34
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,769
an this is gonna be my cock I am at sea

35
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,560
being see but like other information on
I am officially a destructive

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,239
technologist The Washington Post called
me that so I was

37
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,200
so I put that on my the label their on
and there's a website

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,349
I and so it when I see no tutorials you
get them there

39
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:29,349
arm and like officials go ahead and I
get started so are 22 to begin

40
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,829
arm so I live you don't know it was too
%uh this entire talk is basically a wiki

41
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,209
scanner 2.0 talk

42
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:46,209
don't know what the scanner your you'll
be updated

43
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:21,419
okay

44
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:28,419
that

45
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,600
art so on so did the dishes

46
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,700
a free free free free chat because like
roughly this is

47
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,780
I am we're loading Saint recording in
different ways so

48
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,530
you know which cover that of so in short
we edit Wikipedia

49
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,570
you have two choices you can you can
make sure to Cal can you beat your

50
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,250
account name

51
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,400
or you can honestly you don't have an
account but

52
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,950
when you add anonymously in these your
IP address and you know it

53
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,700
but this number to be sneaky a this was
on ostensibly this was done

54
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,840
just to distinguish your anonymous edits
other people in on the status

55
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,590
you know the confusing otherwise are
however

56
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,470
has the caveat that sometimes i cute as
can be traced back to location

57
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,090
but it's kinda tricky I'm but disc is my
idea

58
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,270
0 I'll no that

59
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,060
area okay so I'm

60
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,890
so there's that and I will look at Pier
provides monthly dumps

61
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,510
are although everything on Wikipedia use
Download if you just google

62
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,770
download space Wikipedia it'll be the
first to it's pretty easy

63
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,660
Armando use Download the mall and you
get all the knowledge that it fell

64
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,049
up 21 percent and %uh tracing IQ tests
hard

65
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,799
but you can buy tickets sold it for you
there are three big database that do

66
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,200
this

67
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,390
unfortunately all cost money but now I
can do I

68
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,630
they are they keep the copy the
companies are a max mind dot com

69
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,939
I T two location duck comment over dot
com on

70
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,070
and there in that order price
accordingly expect

71
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:58,270
on any timber together and you have and
balls happens

72
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:03,420
arm okay so if you want what we do we go
through these when I

73
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,189
on insuring just have freedom yes a lot
you edit Wikipedia

74
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,990
a yes CIA does it's kind of exciting arm

75
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,700
well he s also go through these so on so

76
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:19,030
at the CIA actually I did Abuse link the
CIA but it's not really that exciting or

77
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,839
should look like

78
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:26,840
to do the button

79
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,980
well-tailored their way so in the first
edit

80
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,720
it head to head the CIA making entry to
lightsaber combat styles

81
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,579
on em presumably others say doesn't
actually care about lightsaber combat

82
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:51,910
arm I and in the second one it has been
editing a entry about Black September in

83
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,490
Jordan

84
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,279
on and I'm showing these areas is a
lightsaber combat

85
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,570
now I like this one because like when
you think like

86
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,899
keep waiting to Kenya big evil along
with the corporation's

87
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,339
or something like that CA's like the
most like dark

88
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,730
possibly think a but know this is random
people kinda goofy of being really into

89
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,029
Buffy the Vampire Slayer

90
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:15,680
the Buffy the Vampire Slayer lightsaber
combat on

91
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,550
so we can also offer just because said
it would appear with getting into doing

92
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,560
a fair use deeds

93
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,949
I am see another one here so

94
00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:27,730
this this guy here was pilot on old
retired CIA agent Andy Carroll like a

95
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,029
whole personal memoir going on over here

96
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:34,889
arm I don't have his true or not but on
it's probably true

97
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:38,829
i mean you know stretch threaten almost
from the first person

98
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:44,089
but I'll but I you know so easy why it's
clearly a min

99
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,190
I mean it like a memoir red AP is not a
bad place for that I

100
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:53,279
bear ok especially that on see a doctor
who also thought about it so also

101
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,750
I someone from the arkansas governor's
office yeah okay fine

102
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,980
us on from the OXO governors our state
office

103
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,720
a whitewash to page about Mike Huckabee
who is at present or Canada

104
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,370
and others with this is very spicy cuz
you know you what you should be doing

105
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:07,800
that

106
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,269
government machines you know what
washing your on kids pages

107
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,029
and there was a for a loss about it felt
about it from the AP reporters

108
00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:18,189
and I'm I don't know what result that's
gonna be

109
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:23,120
arm and I and i got princess was caught
white washing her own page

110
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,339
occur for connected to a drug baron and
we we know that because

111
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:31,490
on because we we we return trip back to
the palace I am

112

113
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:38,699
salacious edit and she meet the test
upset with that was very nice

114
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,899
arm and yep us too harsh up to to %ah

115
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:46,890
too long to please the Wikipedia pages
and yeah if they do that

116
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,709
see here you go here's one for Conrad
burns the with the controversial speaker

117
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,890
to a voice for the former

118
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,890
yeah

119
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,470
so on but this is this is it too
uncommon any I mean doing too much is

120
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,439
all really fantastic but I mean but you
know

121
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:05,260
you get used to it and isn't but is
awesome I am

122
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,540
but you know that but if you're enjoying
it

123
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,029
and okay so next ok so I'm not
interested so is a great

124
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,300
was restructured other fuels interesting
stuff all

125
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,730
so this is Kenny businesses mind but
it's kinda cool and I kinda wanna spread

126
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,529
it around so

127
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:24,689
this is neat so there's this website
here I'll and I you

128
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:28,099
the you well there we go a real

129
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,740
on its tax cut brought that see emmett
was SEC number

130
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,269
gets too objected to the Wikipedia page
this number gets to the page

131
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,410
hope and this is kinda nice because if
you can we keep your User account

132
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,439
you see on the people are looking at
your page net an interesting arm

133
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:46,860
to and that's really all there is to it
arm for people or switch PS Kenny

134
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,290
on this candy to oz au/t

135
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,480
have never ever taken to a particular
page and we'll tell you very that of the

136
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:55,949
page

137
00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:01,149
so let's do it but you hope again

138
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:05,200
do

139
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,310
thing in here really huge year for you
secretly dislike for the meet me to use

140
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,190
the edit the page

141
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,800
so in this case that we see is one user
really into this page

142
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,490
up this this bill writer arm

143
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,100
but now I mean I i on his person and but
anyway

144
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,560
ratios this is Kenny so if you want your
own with two related work

145
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,339
these are some really nice as a stepping
stone along the way and here's why

146
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:32,570
that's been the more sophisticated on
that I think deserve more pressing

147
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,800
gotten on so this is does this is from

148
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,200
us with this is that this tries to %ah
this just a collar

149
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,399
the back room to get text how long
existed in Wikipedia

150
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:46,730
sisters which p is fundamentally
darwinian process the really

151
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,089
good text that trustworthy and good
stays around a long time

152
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,970
and you can measure the trustworthiness
his attacks how long it existed

153
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:57,190
unchanged on and a collared and you can
still

154
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,910
free demo here and us by the new version
is coming out soon and that's

155
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,040
kind in the so let's see if we can see a
nice

156
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:09,480
example do to you ol

158
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,290
but cheerleading CC here the the

159
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,480
the highlighted areas I have recently
been added and you trust those less

160
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,240
is where the idea and i cant looks very
nice wanna make criticisms levelled

161
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,190
against Wikipedia

162
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:29,399
is that lol you don't know if some 15
minutes ago I headed to that page had a

163
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,360
complete nonsense

164
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,610
but this like completely destroyed that
objection because it had

165

194
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,060
not on them or more securely thanks are
so in short

195
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,050
%uh the look is gonna was off on all but
it was really easy to circumvent

196
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,850
most notably eighty pressured the Celts
you're completely invisible

197
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,160
because the song work on the anonymous
edits up further if you

198
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,390
if you decide it is like not here
corporate IP range that work to

199
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,850
he went home in major edits like you
know which you have no idea

200
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,360
you know you know I you are quite a
catch you so

201
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,640
be much better so

202
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,750
and design produce the wiki watcher with
the swatches have a

203
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,720
Supercenter the key scanner people Ascot
the plot plus if you put the process on

204
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,630
the other side

205
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,270
the assignment isn't right so cell you
know it so just

206
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,069
the and attention arm oh and Kia

207
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,579
so in honor hope the the date there's
1984 so

208
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,149
okay so %uh so I i'm shootin does here
and I shoe size exhibits

209
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,200
so I'ma key scanner there are three
tools and therefore exhibits

210
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,270
on the ones that are really want to show
you arm

211
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,639
so on the 20 listening interactive you
can play with and the exhibit is just

212
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,380
had a static thing but it's still
exciting

213
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,310
so out let's go with be a poor man's
check user first

214
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,820
so for those who don't know but check
user check users a power that many would

215
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,990
get more likes on with Guinness traders
have

216
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,730
to learned the IP address of a
registered account I'm not many people

217
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,140
have

218
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,460
this and it kinda carted of but we can

219
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,450
weekend with economic ghetto style on
and eye-catching how so

220
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,550
sometimes you can I kiss official
account here's how

221
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,879
so we click the button up nope that's
wrong

222
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,600
do you no area

223
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,000
okay so here's what happens so some hoes

224
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,860
Movie Edit team a long time to talk page
and they won't submit

225
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,950
using their IP address here

226
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:14,130
on others gathered for multiple reasons

227
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,930
this used on it can happen if you just
feel like it's been a very very long

228
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,910
time

229
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,430
composing a response to talk page your
sessional timeout

230
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:26,400
and you click Submit sometimes bills
with your IP address

231
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,940
naked annual Obama and the other half
the size if you just just forget to log

232
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,430
in up their garlic

233
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,700
your IQ now showing on the talk page you
don't like that so you

234
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,310
very quickly login and you replace the
IP address with your username now this

235
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,250
is really convenient

236
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,100
because the time because this gives you
a connection between IP address the user

237
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:46,440
name

238
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,620
so now you can go over all Wikipedia
looking

239
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:55,720
just for those and I've done so let's

240
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,310
see that look to do was doing opera

241
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,450
operated better here we go

242
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,660
so lets us know so you think you can
dance here

243
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,440
on C %uh so i'd like a dress for the up
thirteen thousand different usernames

244
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,350
on not a bad deal are especially
considering that most

245
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,650
user names like like so is more likely
to happen to you the more you at

246
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,350
wikipedia:

247
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:23,480
to this thirteen thousand from like the
most frequent contributors

248
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,720
om it's really long on its recent
quickly evident so we think

249
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,980
at this user name is that this IP
address and we'll just one

250
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,990
to do and every up

251
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:44,990
and you can see this review exciting
people all

252
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,689
on well wait for the page loading siege
in the whales

253
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,830
their help

254
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:54,980
the

255
00:19:54,980 --> 00:20:01,980
season there several times yeah it was
ok the show show show that they did

256
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,360
that mean this is really stupid mistake
but I mean it happens to everyone and I

257
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,390
have happened once

258
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,590
ever happen once you know opinion
they're gone so

259
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,580
this tax I'm and most wickedness traders
here on here

260
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,110
okay

261
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,250
so I an extension to that so the next
obvious you do on

262
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,760
is to text sock puppets using this so
sock puppets Wikipedia georgann

263
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,340
21 for you register multiple accounts
and Armenian you triggers their separate

264
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,010
people see me

265
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:34,260
argument with each other ensure you have
multiple accounts act like two different

266
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:34,790
people

267
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,430
the ideas that yet the terms like you
gonna up a puppet master

268
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,870
sup so arm and this is really neat
because now we can detect the things

269
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:44,550
which really

270
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,960
I am to do the Rio so what this does is
we did go down

271
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,820
the poor man's check your list and we to
see which the same IP address

272
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,200
and I hear a lot of suspects up up its

273
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,420
now this can be made a little bit better
now I'm change this one now

274
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,290
%uh this this when pricing your be the
fires is in the willies quite yet

275
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,399
cuz it would be nice if you had this
sorted by %ah arm

276
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,830
ISP instead by IP address and the sequel
curies per that is running

277
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:16,639
like right now so I'm gonna be done like
have it here too

278
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,770
on and up caso so is this case

279
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:24,070
like if you had this if you had many
users are all parts a mom-and-pop ISP

280
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,439
even if you know the exact same IP
address and I think the same person but

281
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,910
as the as this is pretty darn good I so
yes if you want to still of

282
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,080
if your caps on here your pride and get
a letter

283
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,639
the administrators shortly are

284
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,280
30 okay so what that says is that too
many exhibits on our show you the the

285
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,180
new wiki scanner

286
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,250
and neutral publickey ganda on

287
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:51,530
so student with the scanner right now

288
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,590
so %uh as I so I say to both these tools
other than that there there there may be

289
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,629
made by some

290
00:21:56,630 --> 00:22:00,120
us as a summer student of mine at
Caltech update to enrich

291
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,710
energy chanti a gang of take this one
I'm much indebted

292
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:07,610
so ought to real prompt the wiki scanner
whether two major problems

293
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,770
the first one was that it was being
really annoying to go through what I bet

294
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:13,010
it's a few but that's a

295
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,400
a compartment when security you all
there at three thousand those things

296
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,540
wanna go through the mall it's really
annoying so

297
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:23,750
so we want to automate that process so I
cures that you can do

298
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,530
on so are the person you cannot so we do
this using or so when are the funny the

299
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,410
interesting things

300
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,080
we're doing this using the trademark
database in like distance so for example

301
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,340
if Microsoft its position page we'll
automatically

302
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,379
like this because we know because from
the trademark database we know that as

303
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,360
soon as a trademark Microsoft

304
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,680
and we can just automatically like that
and say this is interesting

305
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,490
the only that we can you use usually
distance so arm so the dotnet framework

306
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,380
page

307
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,580
even if dotnet framework is not a
trademark of Microsoft

308
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,449
done a framework page links to the
Microsoft page on wikipedia

309
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:00,380
and we have a list all the major
corporations and Wikipedia pages

310
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,780
so eat him a company its page that links
to their corporate page

311
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:08,250
than that probably interesting as well
on and you can its flag all those you

312
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:08,860
have a nice

313
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,420
and very nice you know RSS feed every
single day for what's probably salacious

314
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,920
on Wikipedia

315
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,920
I'm so I'll show quick demo here

316
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,950
should be in here iraq

317
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:33,690
all well the people will be fine

318
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,830
so it's a secure stable we can see a
little on lets

319
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,149
keep arm

320
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,670
so and and I in this case that the
scanner

321
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,710
are not detected it to the page DeBolt
art were interesting

322
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:51,150
so on this case that cash is pretty
obvious but will

323
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:58,150
but there are other once a week see
Microsoft for example

324
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:06,919
0 that's going to be a lie I with
pictures

325
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,190
wannabes it's like might be a

326
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,600
posts about okay so i'm suppose

327
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,820
so so here so all this is also including
the user name so these are all the

328
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,399
usernames

329
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:22,570
we we know there Microsoft IP range
other I showed you before

330
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:27,439
and these pages here RPT that lead to
Microsoft page

331
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,330
and I'm these I don't know a life is the
price a

332
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,449
all the schools for Microsoft Windows
anyway so says he's put these things and

333
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,059
you can see them

334
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,480
and on you could be expected citiship
interesting arm

335
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,179
and into the hole behind this is that is
is that this this makes it makes it much

336
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:45,769
faster too funny interesting stuff

337
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:49,139
and it's likely I exciting arm

338
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:54,769
and and I think this school on party
publicly released public on a weaker

339
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:55,240
cell

340
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,110
these big need I a kick-butt scale quite
yet of but you know

341
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,049
but this patient base the functionality
on

342
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:06,289
yeah we're that will so I could so just
to be clear the

343
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:09,370
main the main features in the new with
you scanner

344
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,750
RR on number one its are acting conflict
of interest

345
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:17,370
and using the poor man's check user as
well so it's all searching the user

346
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,840
rush at its so witnessing here is what
the end oxo

347
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,559
I this one this one is is different so I
saw this discovery channel thing

348
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,779
like like maybe a few months ago it
describe what appears like this

349
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,970
vast information war zone like he's
entrenched

350
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,090
parties you know like going at each
other all the time

351
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,990
as far as I know this isn't I was no
this is this

352
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:46,019
I mean at other never actually been
shown on it might be true but we don't

353
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:46,340
know

354
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,620
so it's gonna be nice to know are so you
that you do

355
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,990
so you pick two teams we picked you
you'll like organizations probably

356
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,419
hate each other and you see if their
hatred spills over on Wikipedia

357
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:04,220
so was picked to real quick so I could
you have more teams were had two members

358
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,919
but serving as a Microsoft to get at
Google

359
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,929
you know you get the idea

360
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:13,529
thank you what you got other things they
can add like like you know you can add

361
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:15,100
MIT year whatever

362
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,950
anyway you go and it shows you the pages
that both teams have edited

363
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:22,200
a corset its red versus blue that's just
the way the world works

364
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,509
arm so I take a while

365
00:26:25,509 --> 00:26:30,159
these are all really big gracious arm
but on

366
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,759
actually this ok here we go about that
it's nice okay

367
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,960
so both these people now arm

368
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,159
now presumably I there there there

369
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,679
Microsoft's and Microsoft versus Google
know whose views

370
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,690
on Bollywood in human sexual behavior
are are not a contentious issue

371
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,970
arm but these are Peter they both edited

372
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,179
on and the any ideas that you can
perhaps see the pages where the where

373
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,409
their views conflict and you can see for
going at each other consistently

374
00:26:58,409 --> 00:27:03,429
on so up when you can do this if you put
like although all its my ran on on

375
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:07,070
team on the red t know it's for Israel
on say the blue team

376
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,750
are you a holocaust up so like this oo
the

377
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,419
the iran to keep saying the Holocaust
the law and the israelis will say no

378
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:14,799
thaw

379
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,129
ally on so your orders pick one to spur

380
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:21,809
this I mean here multimedia messaging
service 1.9

381
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:25,649
so Microsoft Corp said

382
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:32,649
all

383
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,559
because type way you get the idea

384
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,899
I this is this is this is this is this
is this is of pressure they like like

385
00:27:39,899 --> 00:27:42,919
like like this demo I think just for
roughly maybe thirty six hours

386
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:47,250
so I haven't come through yet um but you
get the idea and and and ass

387
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,289
I hope the source this or the suddenly
answer the question whether not their

388
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:52,049
purses at what's happening with the
media

389
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:55,309
coming up so they'll be less

390
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:58,399
okay well as well Co on

391
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,580
author told that's that secret on you
know about that in two weeks

392
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,678
yet just devastating for that one arm

393
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:08,169
so you moving on also this lot though
he's got Bieber scope

394
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,059
and with Peter Scott this is my most
lighthearted to them

395
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:15,100
now of but now its sole

396
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:22,100
on alone

397
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,379
area

398
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,400
okay so %uh so I'll so I so that it

399
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,640
it happens to be very close to the
Caltech MIT pranking season

400
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,600
and I think this is a Rio to capitalize
on that so

401
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,870
about a year ago us as I and II to help
that so

402
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:44,000
I get my keys are important to me arm so
but you know I stumble across

403
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,010
very oppressive left at MIT external IP
addresses

404
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,540
that really detailed arm so

405
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:53,590
are as a mission Louis water

406
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,679
no look at what time average looking
water I figured to be really nice

407
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,750
if you could I shoulder and it's down to
embarrassing

408
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,860
detail so here you can see basically

409
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,270
every single building sometimes the
individual labs at MIT

410
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,870
estate me so this is one of the young

411
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,440
I'll political lol political analyst
says this is this is the amount will

412
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,000
sell at MIT this isn't

413
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,480
like Buffy a few rooms I and you can see
all the the edited

414
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,059
on this these two are clearly salacious
but it shows you like you know the level

415
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:26,720
of detail

416
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,720
and they get more exciting go so we have
some other ones

417
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,179
and we can see and we know someone

418
00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:41,030
and building W 61 is related to the
parade on

419
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,030
a and use the other things like this and
so this isn't either

420
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:50,280
the first volley the pregnancy arm

421
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,600
yeah osaka is there there there's one
another exhibit that isn't quite done

422
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,040
yet

423
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,510
arm following one former students
working on it it can only be called

424
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:03,210
de Velde on this is it checks for a
Wikipedia built stacking

425
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:07,900
for a admin ship so soso it turn
admission Wikipedia

426
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,179
you know you you vote to see was not
quite a bit but something wrong like

427
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:15,120
%uh 44 who is the administrator and %ah

428
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,390
so I know very frequently are user like

429
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,440
on users voting is highly correlated so
you're a always with the same wages are

430
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,850
be

431
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,900
or always against User be and with this
you could you could read your

432
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,480
correlations in users in this way

433
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,390
are this I said this will have pretty
high overlap with the with the sock

434
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:31,040
puppetry

435
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,149
arm yeah okay so that's what was the
only exciting shy to say

436
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,230
about Wikipedia you have any icon yet so
I

437
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,870
want to meet up with the apt word but
not us more generic specs so

438
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,940
I'm much to my surprise no very few
people seem to do with this

439
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,169
intersection up between computer
security and data mining and I don't

440
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:51,970
know why

441
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:55,760
because it really really easy and down

442
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,400
and if I it's largely untapped so I
think you should be doing this

443
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,610
because like it's it's a trivial arm so

444
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:06,880
and notebook don't have to do is to take
any vulnerabilities of the thought of

445
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,480
and use due to the whole internet about
it and like

446
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,940
that was creativity involved arm just
yeah so I examples to help

447
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,790
you know us spurned so on here some nice
ones

448
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,790
so this is one that on that the dang
kamensky did

449
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,200
on and what he did out there with their
the DNS portability that allows you to

450
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:26,740
see

451
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,120
if someone from I'll are someone in that
local network had is the particular

452
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,290
Wikipedia

453
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,059
the head is a particular webpage or pick
her up your domain

454
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,600
arm based on the timing was based on the

455
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,580
how quickly the as a response to you and
he did this for the

456
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:47,860
Sony BMG rootkit said me remember there
should be a dog attended CDs

457
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,070
and the axis a very unusual domain so
get a list of all the dancers in the

458
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:52,480
world

459
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,190
and a location and his in the sea to sea
wall

460
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,990
all if you want from that network had
access to the

461
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,510
the the intricate domain and the red
dots are where they have arm

462
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,200
an easy to load up what a lot of meals
on their law stuff like that so

463
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,470
at that kinda nice it will resist
actually fantastic

464
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,220
is a from this result he was able he was
able to set

465
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,630
you know you know the
military-industrial complex first REIA

466
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,570
you know like any any single human being
who can

467
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,389
you you can bring those two forces into
collision is

468
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:31,200
is impressive of sky need to

469
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,690
%uh this is this is it this isn't ours
is a quiet data mining but it's very

470
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,010
it's great for you original

471
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,440
so what this does is art this space it
does on

472
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,830
some very simple of grammar parsing art
speeches

473
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,120
ample C-one here %uh this is from IBM i
think

474
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,350
so this is does this this is for %uh for
Alberto Gonzalez testimony

475
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:55,890
and you see his most common phrase

476
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,010
like is a he doesn't recall more than he
does

477
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,290
more than he knows like actually I think
we gotta go

478
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,450
a good I don't and weekend me see how
much he knows things

479
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,149
anyway and and all test they had her and
arm

480
00:33:09,149 --> 00:33:12,640
anyway this is a fantastic analysis
could never woulda guessed it otherwise

481
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:12,929
hit

482
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:17,899
head come and it's completely damning
additionally you can get around it Cano

483
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:21,210
if if that's what you gonna do he
doesn't recall the whole

484
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:25,110
work think

485
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,720
it's just him it's completely
qualitative

486
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,820
it's just its it %uh beautiful I wish I
wish I thought other

487
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,770
anyway lips on his rovings I have a lot
on the items or should do them

488
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:42,000
so this is a short week ago to a scanner

489
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,080
everyone does the WHOIS database we all
know and love it but no one's ever

490
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,290
exported the state on a massive scale

491
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,428
I have no idea why so unlike for example

492
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:53,630
would be fantastic you could show me to
show me every single domain

493
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:57,559
registered to someone at microsoft.com
email address your profile weird furry

494
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:58,740
stuff

495
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:02,090
and I mean how it handled the whole
areas or revise with Wikipedia

496
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,750
dot I hope I would get it or get dressed
you might discover the diaper at now

497
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,089
so on so that that's such a on

498
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,820
area so I so so so so to do that and the
day already exist you just get

499
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,230
arm as I guess what already is that he
would you do than I am done yet these

500
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,580
are all known vulnerabilities

501
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,710
so we oh we oh no cases where up %uh

502
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:25,800
not are naughty data well things

503
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,480
there many people who use the real
estate tax exclusion to hide things

504
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,750
good making idea if this Google can't
see it doesn't exist

505
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,100
well so why don't you treat her like
that text is instead a

506
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,540
don't index this chat the good stuff is
here

507
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,690
any make it index everything explicitly
disallow the robot attacks

508
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,869
got too hot for Google

509
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:52,250
I mean and is it is it is and i cant I
personally find in this year's porn

510
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,179
stash is this way

511
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,918
it's wonderful I and II goes on to do
this

512
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:01,259
on know is that the a doc .doc metadata
we all know but Microsoft dot dot

513
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:01,850
meta-data

514
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:05,430
it's it's been beaten to death at the
like that so 2000

515
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,080
three maybe arm but no one can hurt no
one's ever like

516
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,250
would be awesome had index everything
and everything

517
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,900
are experts removed from Doc docs from
Microsoft dot com

518
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,980
like it's a link with with everything
that's ahead

519
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:23,200
but like with everything so good that
they would that I couldn't see it at sea

520
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,869
I couldn't see it arm as other one is
out the us into a PDF so we've seen

521
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:28,830
cases before

522
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,490
where are the government has released PS
that black boxes on the way you can

523
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,960
remove the black boxes

524
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,300
you get a detectable to ease bull so
it's a lot harder these days because

525
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,210
they've the the

526
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,690
a bit better black box technology but
regardless there's a whole bunch of

527
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,750
are on black box uble RPS out there and
like

528
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,880
and to just do that across the entire
internet

529
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,810
the beautiful on how you gonna do now
he's yes I i actually

530
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,070
all demos one way back in the day

531
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,609
to do

532
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:03,870
30

533
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,750
on so are so I the these movies here are
from Simon here in the front row

534
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,170
from a long time around he remembers
wasn't putting his website was a long

535
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:12,530
time

536
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,910
are scenario selective video here says
it all

537
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:22,910
how easy it is to on black box things

538
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,400
so yes it is black box to know

539
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
you know the the bed yet it's a it's
coming

540
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,980
gasket really is that easy

541
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,390
I don't know why people haven't done
this yet

542
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:27,390

548
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,580
really handy things I was kidnapped from
people

549
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,710
like for trying trying trying to date
him data money things that the ass how

550
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,850
ice cream Google easily well despedida
michael's label

551
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,160
do that at what's the URL shit you arm

552
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,859
on this is for the gate thanks for doing
%uh pantex proper sinks a point like

553
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,910
grammar sentences

554
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,490
like that I'll this good likely to do
that actually this

555
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,060
OK zip about me well shit in your box

556
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,500
on if you ask me how you approximate
text matching

557
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,000
is a really wonderful python function it
just does this arm

558
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,140
its so he up to use the oil here on

559
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:03,330
this is this is like a fantastically
getting you to search for a

560
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:06,900
additional method initiative you're
you're probably get this expert at

561
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,680
arm anyway so I took this into a lot of
really nice to order you can build on

562
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,640
top up so that we want to do as much
work and

563
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,420
no one likes work I and has attended the
tech similarity library

564
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,860
RT its its that you could google on

565
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,380
yep that's what I say these are people
that helped him to the top

566
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,430
the 3 stands up there are my I want some
students thats

567
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:32,870
make a press without sectoral issues
over GP admin who

568
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:36,700
game you are the people I D S and all
these other people are they helped along

569
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,110
the way

570
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:44,110
so on thank you

571
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:58,300
questions

572
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,090
well alright then oh we haven't

573
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:08,600
okay working you on okay

574
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:12,080
so I alright so what do you think of the
possibilities for using

575
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,140
is the wiki watching tools improve

576
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,720
using this to frame people through
Trojans an open wireless at various

577
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,340
companies

578
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,820
but maybe great to go to Microsoft
vandalize although

579
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,030
the next articles so then the press kit
and report on

580
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,470
Microsoft going out doing the thing so

581
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,300
what do you think there's opportunity
this could happen is happening any other

582
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,080
way muscle say whether someone showed a
Microsoft and and made them like dos

583
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,240
random people having

584
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,930
happy just Adobe buddy much worse the
name of the Wikipedia page

585
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:44,930
so I mean I don't see it as any think
uniquely bad indeed but that the press

586
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,270
seems to misunderstand the connection
that an IP to an action doesn't

587
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:49,270
necessarily mean

588
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:52,280
accountability know that experiments
like

589
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:56,470
are so i mean you can always say that on
I mean the coming of the only an open

590
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,200
wireless or something like that me

591
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,900
you know but on I'm propping up most
cases I would not be true

592
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,860
if it is well on a personal so

593
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:10,020
so slight nitpick but as far as on the
sock puppet

594
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:14,450
issue our are you doing any analysis for
removing

595
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:20,040
up large which super large map box like
so I know for a fact that there are

596
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:24,279
you know we that in a while we've seen
literally hundreds of thousands of users

597
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,370
behind single max

598
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:29,770
usually out of country right but did you
you doing our office for that because it

599
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:33,430
you know it be sorted damning it didn't
rain right in if you didn't have a whole

600
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,609
buncha users with the same IP address
like need more than 10 maybe

601
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:40,290
start the needed in the display showed
you the answer is No

602
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:45,630
up but up but there but the house is
coming and that's what was a pretty and

603
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,170
colorful

604
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,600
I'll stop by the public yet so you get a
she a special treat

605
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,520
I but yeah I know I agree I so I

606
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,970
so I call a well comes from iconic you
IP addresses and surely not only way to

607
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,650
the one person

608
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,150
so have reconsidered and putting a
spider across your own output

609
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:07,700
to do the sorta or press release
generation

610
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:13,600
style sigh I so I don't understand
basically merge

611
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,240
your app review individual tools to duty
or detection %uh probably salacious

612
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:18,950
material

613
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,490
and just generate more automatic press
release I'll be good to you if you

614
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:23,280
really nice

615
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,780
yeah I do you do I arm I like that yeah

616
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:31,890
do you get a very healthy blood doing
that hi

617
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,410
how can the people in this room help you
be the first Google match for Virgil

618
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,480
oh you can link to me yes delete my
website

619
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,370
we're told that she art with the anchor
virtual this like like I'm crying number

620
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:44,190
three on

621
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:47,370
on Google for them the query Virgil I
know it's

622
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,700
terrible this is Roman poet guy had
never I don't know way

623
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,520
and I would the OS he's been dead for
years I am whether pretty get off

624
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,590
anyway so it's good that I would know
that

625
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,510
at the least we could do that what
hardware to use

626
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,530
what the hard work yet to do the data
mining

627
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:09,630
00 just om I know we'll see we'll for
this particular one I used a

628
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,950
in an AMD 64 box at Stanford I am

629
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:16,810
but whatever I mean you know I don't you
see polemics nothing fancy

630
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:20,730
i mean i IIIi everything I do everything
in Python in my sequel

631
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,450
that and Lex that's that's all dollars
to it in-os

632
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,180
sorry perfect for a simple person

633
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,319
but ditch day is tomorrow

634
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,130
so you in on although on and secondly
I'm with the

635
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:40,230
Davies you have love on corporations are
trademarks how to develop better word

636
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:40,490
new

637
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,520
acquired oMG where you can download it
from from from the US pick you to go

638
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,080
but eventually block you so I'm so I
should gonna do that

639
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,910
well so I so we wind up getting most of
it and and if you use tor you can get

640
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:53,299
around the block pretty easily

641
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,340
I said where you can buy it I can find a
way to buy it either

642
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:00,710
on but in short the omelet Rick it you
can scrape it live

643
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,260
and that works om and that the best
candidate you right now

644
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,150
it turned out that that that the link
distant the the the

645
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:13,080
important links measure the I was with
tracking much more useful than the

646
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,000
trademark database

647
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,370
sure enough to look more elegant to so

648
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:21,250
a few years ago on the SE 2600 by
someone was able to out anonymous poster

649
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,400
by profiling

650
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,480
everyone would ever posted a message the
less than

651
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,030
what I personally prefer the have and
what certain words elections they often

652
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,870
happened so

653
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:33,180
would be interesting to do an analysis
like that on the weekend he did a base

654
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:36,149
particularly for people who have a lot
of cards that they've edited

655
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,330
you might be able to sleep patterns in
terms of the word selection and the like

656
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,029
and that's another way you might be able
to identify sock puppet even if they're

657
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:45,140
doing something smart with regard to
write they're actually have a case

658
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,120
report on what's happened caught like
that

659
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,170
but I'm not smart enough to know how to
automate that

660
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:53,530
here so if you know alright it up

661
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:57,510
her down but yeah i mean i i suspect
they're actually probably either to get

662
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,160
a linguist or are typing

663
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,180
economic specially might even know how
did know how to do that I think there's

664
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,640
a mi technical problems and

665
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,879
in making it work in in the tech in the
Wikipedia contacts where there's a lot

666
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,260
of weight at a lotta

667
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,850
yeah no I'm so that I agree with you
completely this has been done

668
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:18,850
I personally don't know how to do that
atop my head

669
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:27,340
well on I had a good time so I'll be
ordered to

670
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,220
alright coming up in a few minutes

671
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:41,220
advanced memory forensics really seen
the cold boot utilities

672
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:54,890
cast now

673
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,880
you
