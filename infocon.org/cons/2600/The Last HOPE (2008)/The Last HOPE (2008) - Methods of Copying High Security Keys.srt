I'm a know what works on Friday

64
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,930
a world there were some technical
difficulties the

65
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,080
so we decided that the first part of the
presentation

66
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,680
I'll do it by myself and a when does

67
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,969
time for questions on will sitting next
to me to maybe on some of your

68
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,969
technical questions that you have a.m.
but I'll

69
00:06:28,969 --> 00:06:32,139
oh and that then you don't worry you
know you you you will not miss him that

70
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:32,930
much I hope

71
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,669
those on Phi

72
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:43,669
okay a

73
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,749
autographs after the session for him but
anyway okay here we go

74
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:51,709
I am dot the the thing s a as was
explained

75
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:56,050
earlier I've done quite some lockpick
presentations

76
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,750
a.m. and I decided it was time for
something new i mean

77
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,139
I always try to to come up with a new
thing

78
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,469
to talk about in the locker area and you
can keep

79
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:11,969
you know going with to a a lock picking
a lock bumping and all that stuff

80
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:16,039
but I thought you know let's let's do
something that's I think not being

81
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:17,120
talked about much

82
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,060
and it is copying keys coping high
security keys

83
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,370
and how easy and difficult this is to to
actually make copies of

84
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,159
of piece of metal because that's
actually where the key is am

85
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,610
so first things first what actually is a
key we all have several keys on a

86
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,360
keyring

87
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,019
but what does a key do and how does the
key

88
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,919
operate and why can one key operated the
look and the other key cannot

89
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,409
while they almost look the same and
that's simply because in most

90
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,469
mechanical locks the key push pins

91
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:54,919
to a correct position and if one of
these bins is not pushed correctly as I

92
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,188
will get back to later

93
00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:00,009
is annoying how do I turn this off

94
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,499
okay

95
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:09,819
yeah so I am thinking of how can I
disable my wifi network

96
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:14,090
anyway don't pick me please

97
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,319
ok anyway what would a key mostly does
is

98
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,330
inside the mechanical lock it will a
moved from elements

99
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,460
and unlock it if one of the elements in
the lockers not in the correct place are

100
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,560
in the correct angle

101
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,759
a.m. the look is not going to operate
and

102
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,849
yeah that that's what it does no

103
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:36,870
when I'm doing a presentation I will
talk about

104
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:39,940
locks in the american way the American
protocol

105
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,760
the way the locker is this is for
European look this is not standard

106
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,740
because in Europe

107
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,839
the look is mounted upside down but in

108
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,010
US the looks are mounted up and since my
first experience was with american

109
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,130
locksmith books

110
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,410
you know I always follow this protocol
because this is how I grew up

111
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:00,829
the so that means that we have a house

112
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:04,870
plug in the pin and we have bottom pants
that are actually in the blog

113
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,660
and we have house bins that are actually
in the top so if I say it poppin

114
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,079
I mean pins that are in the house I hope
that's clear so

115
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,730
a.m. if you look inside the lock you see
the

116
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:20,899
blue top been and the Reds bottom pin at
this moment the core

117
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,970
cannot turn because the blue bin is in
the way

118
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,010
only when the key enters the lock and
lift up

119
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:32,290
this a is reppin only at that time

120
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,069
the core can turn at this moment the
blue pin is in the way of the

121
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,510
of the court turn and thats you know
basic

122
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,640
lockpicking the very basic stuff and as
I said I've been enough for many many

123
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,839
many years and that's a look big village
downstairs with 20 people

124
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:51,380
30 people teaching you how to pick locks
are locks work so I guess by now

125
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,250
everybody understands this and have nots
you know she was downstairs and we'll

126
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,970
explain that a little bit deeper in
detail

127
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,279
a.m. having said that you know this is
one more image

128
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:05,510
of a correct key in the core

129
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,399
where you see all the pins all the core
pins on one line

130
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,029
and if you then remove thats key a
little bit

131
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,510
then the bins get out of alignment and
the first been

132
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,390
as we say sinks into the core meaning
that the

133
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:25,860
the been on top of that will germans the
second

134
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,300
to print will actually stick out of the
core a little bit preventing

135
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,140
it from turning it so now it has turned
into an incorrect key and I'm going to

136
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,100
turn this off

137
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:41,100
even if it takes me one minute because
this is not nice

138
00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:51,129
yeah i i help

139
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:58,129
system preferences

140
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,270
what go back to the rescue

141
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,279
is a buck somebody I dearly love

142
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,279
special

143
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:28,240
10 network right II 10 network right
shipment

144
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,040
okay here we go

145
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,589
well at least you know now we got rid of
that annoying thing and I can really

146
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,770
focus now on

147
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,160
a on the presentation a.m.

148
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,280
what's important to know with keys and
locks

149
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,890
in the mechanical domain is that its all
fixed size

150
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:54,819
so the pins that are in the lock the
pins that are preventing the look from

151
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,500
turning

152
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,400
if the the incorrect key is inserted
a.m.

153
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,570
have increments and most of the time are

154
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:07,180
then steps the that these bins can have
so you can have a really long been

155
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,320
then it's a position 9 if you have a
really short been it's either 0 or 1

156
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,530
and this spinus you know if you can
identify the length of the bin

157
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,540
you know the combination of the lock if
you noted in

158
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,890
in in gate number one is a pin 5

159
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,230
you know and and that is by part you can
cut the key to that height

160
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,230
a.m. this actually is a screenshot from

161
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,870
computerize key cutter in a in a in a
locksmith shop

162
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,940
so if you know combination of

163
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,250
of the the key you can just enter its

164
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,590
and a insert a blankie and the Machine
got

165
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:51,590
the key for you on on croat house is
possible anyway

166
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,890
turn off grow okay

167
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:03,910
I i think it's done I am

168
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,980
okay so so having said that you know
it's very important to realize that

169
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,160
the the Dept in a key are not random if
you if you look at

170
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,310
these keys a

171
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,590
I'm date they have fixed

172
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,230
steps and also the spaces where the cuts
are in

173
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,650
is also affixed length now

174
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,600
what what methods did the look industry
come up with two

175
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,640
protect people from copying keys the

176
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,380
the most clever one is Dave they do

177
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,670
bet on two tricks in the key so they
have some better that mechanism that

178
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,440
will do something extraordinary that
they have a bet and on

179
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,360
a and in that case you know only they
are allowed to make

180
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,480
the blank so it's a legal protection
it's not a a technical protection its

181
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,680
legal protection

182
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,290
a really a locksmith if he makes
patented

183
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,930
be turkey is really in a lot of trouble
because you break a better and you're

184
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,490
not doing something naughty its

185
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,690
um another thing that they do

186
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:11,530
and and it sometimes combined with
patents is editing

187
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,670
a a special elements in the key

188
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,930
that a key cutters normally cannot copy

189
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,370
so its first you know we started with
these dimple peace the

190
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,720
the the keys to the holes in them and at
the beginning

191
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,060
you know for locksmiths that was really
a big deal because they couldn't copy it

192
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,740
but then a couple of years later there
was so much demand for a machine that

193
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,370
can do that

194
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:35,520
that they made a machine to copy dimple
keys and then

195
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,880
they made impulse that were not fully
drill and you know it's it's a whole war

196
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,200
going on between the

197
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,010
manufacturers of these machines and

198
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,890
block industry they also like to

199
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:53,730
at you know thinks that's that a special
to deadlock sliders magnet

200
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,040
cuts in an angle floating elements I'll

201
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,300
get back to that or later another thing
that they do is assign

202
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,010
and exclusive profile the profile is to
shape of two key

203
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,760
so if you look at the tip a few key you
know I've I've noticed that in

204
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,260
in the US it's mainly a straight line
with maybe one or two small

205
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,410
angles in it and that's nothing unlike
in Europe where

206
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,689
you know key go six ek from one side to
the other

207
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,940
and really has a lot of different shapes
but but I've seen that in the US lot of

208
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,600
chalet keys in the Primus keys no not
prime mister

209
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,740
quick sets it's all a straight line
would maybe one or two

210
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,020
so that's nothing special the

211
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:40,050
mmm but what what looking she does is
they assign a special exclusive profile

212
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,020
an exclusive shape of the key

213
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,060
to specific locksmith they say okay
listen we will

214
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,589
you know give you this exclusive profile
it will not be for sale for anybody else

215
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:53,410
a.m. we will just not handed out to
anybody else

216
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,850
but that doesn't mean it's protected by
patent you know if I

217
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,200
want to make that key you know did is
nothing legally

218
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,280
as far as I understand preventing me
from

219
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,880
copying the piece of metal if there's
not bet on them

220
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,150
but yet that is done often especially to
you know bic

221
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,760
dealers big locksmiths that have their
own profile

222
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,780
or to a project you know if you have a
school

223
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,540
or hospital or whatever they will get an
exclusive profile

224
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,969
that can only be sometimes even
requested only by

225
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,720
the the keys can only be made by the
manufacturer

226
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,760
and now these methods

227
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,839
mentioned above were only prevent copies
made at the local hardware stores or at

228
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:37,250
the

229
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,980
you know the local locksmiths because if
you really determined I don't know if

230
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,570
you read

231
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:46,580
the latest 2600 magazine I wrote a small
article on

232
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,910
copying piece that a little bit
difficult to do

233
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,160
a was a youth experiment so maybe you
want to read it up

234
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,319
a.m. but if you really determined you
can make

235
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,420
copies of metal pieces pieces of metal
because that's what the key is

236
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,830
and on and I have been in a lot of look
pick to a locksmith

237
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:11,750
a a lock manufacturers a

238
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,300
in love companies we looked at No me
think

239
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,819
drifting off um

240
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,909
we visited a lot of lock factories

241
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,160
and if you see how keys are made the
keys are made

242
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,640
you know one second to keep such the
really

243
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,530
grain and other fees metal really fast
and so if you expect

244
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,170
essay look company that you know thing
that you can make in one second with

245
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:39,570
your

246
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,169
with a high-tech machine somebody else
can never copy you know that that's a

247
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,410
wrong assumption

248
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,520
because it's at the end of the day's
only piece of metal

249
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,700
now the most simple way to

250
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,410
to decode a key or two to copy a key

251
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,770
is to look at the key if it if it has a

252
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,150
registration number like a sh4 force
lake or

253
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,030
whatever you know if you can identify
what type of blank what I've profile is

254
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,310
used and it's mostly

255
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:10,790
written on the key a and the next up is
to just

256
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:14,950
measure up the depths of guts and if you
know dat

257
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,500
you know you can go home you can never
file you can have a blankie

258
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,570
and you can cut it or if you have access
to computerized machine

259
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,639
you can cut it and it's really nothing
more

260
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,790
then you know if somebody can determine

261
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,379
how deep a specific gotti's game is over

262
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,330
a.m. if you don't have something to
measure to keep by

263
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,810
and you have access to a key that that
you want to to copy or that you're

264
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,040
interested in

265
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,580
a.m. in high security keys is really
funny because

266
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,840
they have a lot of sex act lines
especially in in Europe

267
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,629
and as you can see on this serving
hausky there's a lot of lines as a lot

268
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,090
of

269
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,439
you know changes in the profile going
from left to right

270
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,450
and you can actually use that's to read
the key you can say okay the first cuts

271
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,560
is actually the right in the middle

272
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,120
of the first groove that you see and

273
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,650
the second cup is actually much deeper

274
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,170
a and a third garth et cetera et cetera

275
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,390
so with these lines you can moralist
identify

276
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,690
roughly even if you don't have axis2

277
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,030
to something to measure it the

278
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,639
what the combination is and and and and
a skilled look bigger

279
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,929
especially you know people from to in
Germany

280
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:36,300
if you if they have a peek at your key
for one second

281
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,800
you know it's its is lost I and no i lo
lo hi lo

282
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,950
okay that's it you know and they don't
know what to expect and

283
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,200
that really is intelligence dent in your
system is compromised

284
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,790
if people with some knowledge look at
Yuki stand

285
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,399
now another way to make copies of keys
if you

286
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,940
you know if you if you cannot take them
with you ace to make detailed photo I

287
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,520
mean for the cameras getting smaller and
smaller

288
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,030
or a xerox copy a.m. and xerox copy ng

289
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,280
really worked well a its its and almost
one on one copy you can go home in

290
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,450
you know measure it and and have a look
on where on the lines

291
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,980
cots are and as you can see here on the
on the

292
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,820
on the cars look this is just a standard
photocopy just

293
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,010
you know the first run I I just made a
photocopy and as you can see

294
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,408
a once you for the copy this key you can
spend

295
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,070
three months you know figuring out how
to make a piece of metal that will fit

296
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,090
the lock

297
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,439
and how to cut it exactly do that Dept
but at the end of the day if people have

298
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,020
access to a mechanical key

299
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,730
for a very short time the whole system
can be compromised

300
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,010
another method that I heard of

301
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,510
know if you don't have access to a 20 X
machine and and you really

302
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,280
our focus on getting a copy of the key
is too impressive

303
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,800
into your arm for as long as you can

304
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,679
and just give it a try I mean you know
don't don't do it for 30 seconds but

305
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:10,120
just do it a little bit longer

306
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,870
and just see how long it takes for the
the imprints

307
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,360
to to finish it really status on quite
some time

308
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,530
a.m. having said that you know this this

309
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:26,790
even gave me some bruises afterwards but

310
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:30,389
but you know afterwards you can identify
more or less how deep they are

311
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,860
even even if you have to guess a little
a

312
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,890
it's it's still interesting yeah

313
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:40,890
wait to to do it now

314
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:44,100
if if and exclusive profile issues

315
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,820
in a in in in the key system

316
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,110
you have a problem going to get the
original

317
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:56,159
key to make your your your your your key
from

318
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,740
and its so funny that over the last days
I've spoken with some people

319
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,830
a one was 17 your year olds a engineer

320
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,360
that said out it's funny that you say
that because when I was in high school

321
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,090
you know I wanted to have a copy of the
march to keep

322
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,320
not to do anything illegal but just to
explore a little and to make my life

323
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,810
more comfortable

324
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,580
and he said what I did was a I called
the generator that

325
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,870
Mikey was inside and at my door was
locked

326
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,260
and he came with the march to keep and I
took a peek on the march to keep

327
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,129
and so on what positions it was
different from Mikey

328
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,630
while you know that's that's amazing
a.m.

329
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,790
and then he he recognize more or less
where the

330
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,050
where the cuts were that were different
and then he

331
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,050
the removed his look from the door and
look at the bins

332
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,010
and laid him out you know we just took
his own life above the door

333
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,620
to a look at the pins and said okay on
these two positions

334
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,090
Mikey is too deep the key to the head

335
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,230
you know couldn't be turned into a march
to keep because they were too deep

336
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,929
so what he did was he used solving Iran
filled up

337
00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,640
the the the keys which folder and you
know we had to score and we could file

338
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,320
until

339
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,710
it was a perfect fit and he had a march
the key to the system

340
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:15,710
and he gave me the march to keep a he
was kind enough to give it to me and I

341
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,150
don't know if I can put it under your
butt let's let's just

342
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:23,440
you know going to presentation and we'll
see later if I

343
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,400
if I if I showed him but it was really
funny and that's not the first time I

344
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:27,940
heard

345
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,520
the people actually fill up existing
peace

346
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,168
would be some metal to to create a blank
that way

347
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,179
and yet the key that you see here is an
asset to be in which is very high

348
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,300
security

349
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,280
very accurate lock and hun and I once
had a bet with somebody

350
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,730
that he said you cannot copy this key a
and what we did was we bought

351
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,300
key at the same shop where he bought it
and they all have the same side bar code

352
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,250
which is the most difficult thing

353
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,429
and we filed the petitions that you know
his key

354
00:23:59,429 --> 00:24:03,210
had up and what I actually used is

355
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,320
I use pieces of a nickel to got fee
shaped

356
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,110
pieces and sold them in with hearts over
so use a little bit different

357
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,010
technique but at the end of the day if
you can get access to

358
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:19,060
any key that will fit that lock you know
if you have time enough and if you're

359
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,720
determined enough

360
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,980
the mechanical system will lose after
all it will

361
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,450
a now there's a little story from the
Netherlands

362
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,610
a a I think about 15 years ago twenty
years ago

363
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,980
there were phone phreaks in the
Netherlands that a

364
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,290
wanna that have access for a very short
time

365
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,370
to the two key did you see above

366
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:46,950
the the look that you see above in a in
the green

367
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,260
RR national phone companies green did
that the caller

368
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,330
a.m. and what they had actually worse
and

369
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,030
econ lock and I can lock a.m.

370
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,678
is not only just your your straights a
key or even if it's a 660

371
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:06,120
but they have little wings on the site I
don't know if you can see two weeks

372
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,380
on the site of of these book both the
suan

373
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,060
the Sun and what it is is that on the
site

374
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:17,200
there's actually elements winks that
push away

375
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
locking elements in the side of the

376
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,940
of Turkey so there's a row of pins on
top

377
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,929
and there's a couple of pins on the site
and they all have to match

378
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:32,440
now they could not get copy of a a

379
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,740
of the key that goes in even if it's too
low should have a problem

380
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,880
and date date that they want to have a
copy of that so

381
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,760
one of their friends was mechanical
engineer

382
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,280
and he said are no problem I'll make
that key for you is just a piece of

383
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,928
metal

384
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:51,860
and that's what he did this is a is the
picture

385
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,179
the measure stuckey in 3d and he

386
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,450
a a push to put all the measurements in
is

387
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:03,659
in its equipment and out came the this
key I don't know if you can see it

388
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,110
but this is the is not the original key
because I'm

389
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,200
never had access to that it's an a
similar key

390
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,250
that haz weeks so if you can

391
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,710
can see it I'm and and this is the the
copy that they made an

392
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,179
year when I first saw that you know I
said I gotta have a copy of that key and

393
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:22,669
not

394
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:25,540
because I wanted access to that phone
booth but because I thought it was such

395
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,120
a great idea

396
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,250
that somebody was actually skilled
enough to just

397
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:33,600
take a %uh blank piece of metal and you
know

398
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,740
said this machines in and do some magic
and then

399
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,480
make a blankie its II funded really
amazing

400
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,250
and even for me that was an eye-opener
that that somebody actually

401
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,900
did that I mean that you can do that
theory yes but that people actually do

402
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,460
that that's

403
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,300
amazing to me now

404
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,580
these were all the the the simple
methods to

405
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,840
to hack around a little bit with keys
and

406
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:04,149
but you know sometimes the min

407
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:07,190
you have access for a very short time
and

408
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,450
one of the things that you can use to
make a quick

409
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:13,909
pro-peace that are highly accurate is

410
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:19,810
with clay its its you know very simple
idea I think we all as a kid played with

411
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:22,408
clay and put something in this or the
impression

412
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,649
and that's basically what this kid us
this is a kid from

413
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:31,580
US the toolmakers organization for for
locksmiths

414
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,850
and its I don't know what I paid I think

415
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:37,899
150 200 euros something like that

416
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:44,740
and it's even overpriced if you look at
what's inside

417
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,990
well you know it's it's a very simple
steps

418
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,440
but is really very accurate so what's
inside

419
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,600
is some baby powder issue can see

420
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,190
and and I'll get back to that later the
to to

421
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,250
white things their

422
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,740
are little clams that's also why this
kid is called clam

423
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,679
and that's actually what we will use to
make the impression of

424
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,200
of the key there some play inside there
some

425
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,679
low melting metal inside there's a
candle inside

426
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,960
and yeah basically that's it

427
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,530
I think you can more less imagine how it
works I had the idea

428
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,020
to you know be really daring and and use
this

429
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,230
this video stand to to do it step by
step

430
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:34,140
but I decided not to do it because
technique is not my best friend these

431
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,350
days

432
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,840
I'm so I decided to just make more
religious order photo

433
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,740
to a thing on how this works

434
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,450
so if you wanna make a copy with this
clamp kits step 1:

435
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,420
East to to take one of these clamps

436
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,240
and open its get some of the clay the

437
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,460
more than of just makes it the bits

438
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,700
and and a few key ready

439
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,750
then you separate the clay and you fill
out the two halfs

440
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,760
of the climate is really straightforward
and really simple

441
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,870
a.m. and then with the I don't know how
you called

442
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,950
but than you separates the remaining two
top remaining layer

443
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,580
with with that knife with that sharp
edge

444
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,689
and you did on both sides

445
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,270
and what you can do is if you would now

446
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,639
close the clam boats sites we stick
together

447
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,790
so it would not be possible to remove
them easily

448
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,059
and that's when where the the baby
powder comes in

449
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:45,559
a.m. you apply generous amount baby
powder on both halfs

450
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,928
on one of Iraq's meted out on one of its

451
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:53,090
its it's there by the way I flew in with
the stuff through customs hours like

452
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,260
you know from Amsterdam with the bottle
of baby powder and plastics

453
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,540
play a its

454
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:04,780
but they've worked out in under let me
im I'm always surprised if they let me

455
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,178
in but

456
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:11,429
but anyway you you can see what is going

457
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,620
a.m. then what you do is you gently

458
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,510
Press the key into one of the hops you
don't want to push it in

459
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,290
2d you just wanna push it in to the
point that it doesn't fall out

460
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,159
so you have to make it stick a little
bit is what you do

461
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:30,640
a.m. now then you know I can make then
stepped in closing it but this is

462
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,720
yeah a close to clam

463
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,460
and you really press tightly

464
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,809
now if you then open it again and gently

465
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:43,980
remove it you can see in and I don't
know how

466
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,850
good this be Murray's but here on the
screen you know it's

467
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,300
really really really accurate the
impression

468
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,679
that has left in this silly clay and its

469
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,059
it's nothing special I mean it's
probably something that any kid can make

470
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,379
for for for a couple of books

471
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,370
but thats that's what you do now what
you do afterwards issue close to clamp

472
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,770
you heat up some of the metal you pour
it in while it goes in UTEP it a little

473
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,120
bit so the air bubbles come out

474
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,820
and then you have your key I mean I
could have made all the steps as well

475
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,070
but then you know my two hours would be
a by now so I decided to

476
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:27,159
let you have something left for your
imagination

477
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,929
I'm so we tried this

478
00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:34,410
the on a wide number of of

479
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,620
of keys especially since we came here

480
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:42,150
a hum was huge collection of locks
picked up some office

481
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:46,370
most high-security locks from Europe
from the US

482
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:51,440
and a.m. that worked in almost all cases
in almost all cases we were able to make

483
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,179
impressions of this piece of metal

484
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,790
push from low melting madeleine into the

485
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,990
impressions and have a working key
sometimes is required

486
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,010
little scraping off edges you know
little

487
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,070
sometimes it's not perfect a

488
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,889
but if especially if you scrape off some
metal and you have an eye on

489
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:15,100
one were to scrape off the metal you
know you will

490
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,559
definitely be able to make it but in
some cases

491
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,580
a just work straight out of the box
nothing fancy

492
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,629
so this isn't easy way to copy

493
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,929
keys even the high-security once as you
can see no

494
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,820
a some people have been bashing on
medical all-conference Oh I thought you

495
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,559
know we might as well include them

496
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,790
a know but who I think medical actually
makes

497
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,920
very good looks and its

498
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,179
yeah almost a pity that these guys are
are

499
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,940
in that corner that they are in now
having said that you know

500
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,690
the that things are as they are and in
high security applications

501
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:00,120
they have a serious problem as far as
i'm concerned. the

502
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,910
the medical ok the that you see or the
key

503
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:08,179
has got angles and cups and that that's
the thing with medical don't only live

504
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:12,230
bins to put Ishan they also rotate them
in a position

505
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,700
and we were real curious if you know
with the simple clay

506
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,960
impression gets if these angles would be

507
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,160
a a correct and

508
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,790
it it works we did have two

509
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:31,110
to modify the little bit at position 5

510
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:34,460
that the metal was not perfect their so
you know

511
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:37,750
to be honest it didn't work out of the
box straight away but with a little

512
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,440
modification it work

513
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,420
and I'm quite confident that you know if
you tried more

514
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,900
if you get a little bit even more
experienced with using this

515
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,309
that that got that you have a a fairly
good chance of

516
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:56,750
of making an impression making a working
key this way

517
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,320
now another a key that we copy is the
chalet Primus

518
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,928
and slick primis is really
top-of-the-line at the moment I think in

519
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:05,790
the US it's one of the most

520
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,710
difficult to manipulate lock

521
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,089
I'm and also the key copying you know
they're very proud of

522
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:17,389
on showed me a brochure saying often
imitated never duplicated

523
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,060
a and and they are rights it's a very
very very

524
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,270
high tolerance lock

525
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,349
so if something isn't right the look is
not gonna open

526
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:31,609
the the

527
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:35,049
sidebar profile that you see over there

528
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,200
actually picks up a PM which to specific
height

529
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,550
and to a specific rotation these are
called the fingerprints

530
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:47,250
and you can see them here hopefully and

531
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,230
it's really an ingenious system on on

532
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,679
locking and unlocking and its is one of
the

533
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,170
one of the top line and hun wrote an
article about its

534
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,960
a a 0 its still has to come out to see
more information on our set to in

535
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,070
systems part 2

536
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:11,070
and I think you know only a part 1 right
now it's okay sir

537
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,140
well later you know if there's time left

538
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,230
I'm can on some of the questions or talk
something about

539
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,349
now the the funny thing is that

540
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:24,790
we we managed to make a copy of this

541
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,070
slick Primorsky and a.m. as you can see

542
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,990
you know it it looks it looks the same
a.m.

543
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,400
but what was really funny is that there
were actually holes in the key

544
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,540
where this angle gots are at

545
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,740
at the bottom of the key

546
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:47,369
but still the keyword out of the box
without any

547
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:51,760
modification you know it work and we
really surprised by that

548
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,369
but sometimes if the the metal in the
key is getting very thin

549
00:35:56,369 --> 00:36:00,599
the the liquid metal that you're pouring
in cannot fall in

550
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,839
all the way or you know doesn't get in
all the way and even while tapping its

551
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:08,009
sometimes you know the metal is not
there

552
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:11,460
but in these cases still the key works

553
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,920
now wanna for my personal favorite locks
is

554
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,630
the Fr 3k yes it's a look that's mostly
unknown I think

555
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,170
to people in the US its

556
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,140
it's it's like a watch almost it's
really high precision

557
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,569
it works with sliders so there's no pins
but their sliders that have to be

558
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:38,089
elevated to specific Heights there's
multiple tracks

559
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:41,970
as you can see in the key tree KS tents
for

560
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,490
that I could fancy staying which means
in German three curves system

561
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:48,619
a actually the only using to to

562
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:52,080
really a of variables but

563
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,440
its it's a very sophisticated key and I
was really curious

564
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,790
if we could do it with the simple clay
impression in kids

565
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,529
if we could make a copy of that and

566
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:07,780
we also succeeded in making a copy of
that now

567
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:12,300
if as you can see the same thing
happened as with the Primus

568
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,760
and that's that there's actually a whole
in the key

569
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,099
um can you see that at the did

570
00:37:19,099 --> 00:37:24,570
of the key that there's there's a whole
Kiyoshi and actually

571
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,880
that those this a few more I think also

572
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,960
a and

573
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,060
anyway we we tried it and also this key

574
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,690
also open the lock because at the end of
the day

575
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,160
the slightest have to be put in a
specific position and it doesn't matter

576
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,480
if there's no metal there

577
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,790
as long as the sliders are being pushed
a a

578
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:51,910
in in the correct position and the
distance in the in the middle of the key

579
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,399
is really really close

580
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,990
so it's it's actually quite logical that
some of the

581
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,609
the places are that there's no middle
there

582
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,848
but the bottom line is that if you go

583
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:07,780
to a look shop you say I want to copy of
this key

584
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,260
they will look at you really funny you
know they say its

585
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,000
its its not a blank that I have it's not
even a system I know

586
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,089
and even if I know to system you know
how am I going to make these groups with

587
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,200
different depts

588
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,369
it's it's a really complex system yep

589
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:29,280
with this kids only 150 euros are two
hundred euros wanted to pay

590
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,310
a you can make a copy of this key

591
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,089
relatively simple and straightforward a

592
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:41,000
having said that the question is how
many times can you use that key

593
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,710
you know we we tried it a couple of
times and after opening a couple of

594
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,390
times

595
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,589
it already started to wear a little bit
because these luxury high-security

596
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:53,849
locks now

597
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:57,660
the application with this click it is
that you can open the lock couple of

598
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,580
times and

599
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,940
the basic idea is that you make a copy

600
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,859
on a key machine later so it's just to
preserve

601
00:39:05,859 --> 00:39:11,160
the the cuts in a key and for you to
bring it to a normal copier and in being

602
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,190
able to cut it

603
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:16,319
so if you have evil intent and you know
you have a x2

604
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:20,000
really interesting key and you want to
open once or twice the lock

605
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,390
to to steal stuff for that it's going to
work

606
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,400
but if you're going to use it on a daily
basis

607
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,319
and a you know you have to open the door
multiple times a day

608
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:33,219
good luck it's it's not really the

609
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:40,059
going to last that long I think and now
we we started with the public protec

610
00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:43,200
a.m. its wanna Ponce favorite looks

611
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,400
a.m. and we also tried

612
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,430
with the clay kids and it came out just
fine

613
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,618
but we also tried it with another

614
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:57,140
technique that we used to make copies of
high security keys

615
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,140
because we could not copy all

616
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,078
the keys not all the high security keys
and I'll get back to why

617
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,219
it didn't work but this actually

618
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:11,349
a a copy made of from avoid protec

619
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:15,089
key to a system that works with discs
you could just see

620
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:18,200
but this copy is not made

621
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,729
with clay this copy is made with
silicone and its action the

622
00:40:22,729 --> 00:40:28,700
something that's used in the dental
industry the

623
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,289
now I told you about my clay kids that
worse

624
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:35,410
maybe 200 euros this also

625
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,328
kids with silicone impression silicone

626
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:42,499
based

627
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:46,239
and that kids is much more expensive

628
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,759
what you see here I paid 500 euros for
and it was still

629
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:54,819
consider the bargain a.m. this can make
me approximately I think

630
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:58,788
would worsen 35 copies 35 keys

631
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,809
I can make with this get so it's

632
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:05,329
it's not it's not cheap but it's very
very very

633
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:08,829
accurate and as I said it's

634
00:41:08,829 --> 00:41:12,299
based on and

635
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:15,400
technology from the dentist area

636
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,329
and what you have is the the blue stuff

637
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:23,619
on top and that really is a big a big
part

638
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:27,519
a.m. and that actually is a silicone

639
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,869
a a liquids

640
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:36,190
and these other two bottles that you see
here elements that you have to mix

641
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:39,489
with that silicone to make it harden so

642
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:43,509
the the silicon from the from the thing
you can just four

643
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:48,199
just assess if it is words it's not like
water but it's it's it's almost like to

644
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:51,630
but if you mix these two other elements
with it

645
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,969
within 10 minutes it will are going out
so the whole idea is

646
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:59,670
to make the the silicone

647
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:03,499
on the spot to mix it a and then use

648
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:06,900
the this which is actually the heart of
the system

649
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,709
it's a really heavy duty hi decision

650
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:14,259
high-precision clam and this

651
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:19,219
clam is used to to clamp the key

652
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:23,199
while you poured in the mixed silicone
material

653
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,180
so you first you know you fix a

654
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,848
the the key to the

655
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:33,880
to the top part a.m. and then you put

656
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,999
to claims together you mix the material

657
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:40,829
you pour it in and then with the with
the leftovers

658
00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:44,869
you paint the key a little bit you make
sure that there's no air bubbles in

659
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:45,319
there

660
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:49,339
so if you have these blue you really
apply it as

661
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:53,288
as well as you can to that key and then
you stick it in and

662
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:56,719
a a let it wait for 10 minutes and if
you don't

663
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,339
remove the clamp after 10 minutes just
his heart

664
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:03,440
peace of silicone

665
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,930
rubber actually that's what it is it
feels like robber

666
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,959
and it's not stiff it's it's flexible

667
00:43:09,959 --> 00:43:14,269
a yet it is extremely xx a

668
00:43:14,269 --> 00:43:17,609
that the only problem is is that Yuki
still inside and

669
00:43:17,609 --> 00:43:21,038
you know how are you going to get that
out the

670
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:25,299
as I said after 10 minutes of waiting
you can open it

671
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:28,799
and with a knife and that's why you know
to steal

672
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:35,349
shape is so important you got away you
you you makin

673
00:43:35,349 --> 00:43:38,489
decision into this a a silicone

674
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:43,680
part and you can remove two key now

675
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,160
if you if you got

676
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,670
precisely you know we could to work out
just fine and

677
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,190
you can make really really really
excellent

678
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:57,609
Copics of a of high security keys

679
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:02,288
with it and it can even do some keys
that you cannot do

680
00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:08,289
with clay for instance since we came to
the US we want some high security locks

681
00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:12,369
a one of the high security locks is
sergeant que solo

682
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,229
and with a search in case a look their
spins coming from three sites

683
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:22,319
in from the left from the right from the
top a.m.

684
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,329
you can see over der on on the left that

685
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:30,039
that is the case that's what the key
looks like

686
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:33,339
and its also in high-precision lock

687
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:36,719
you know the slightest ever will

688
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,660
a a not open the look anymore

689
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,729
am we tried with clay and interesting

690
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:47,349
thing with clay is that if you

691
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:50,660
make a copy with clay it will work fine
except for

692
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,660
the site bins Bence that are on on the
site here so it's not the pins on the

693
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,420
top it's not the pins on the bottom

694
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,319
but on the site as soon as you remove
claimed if you open the clam

695
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,849
you will destroy your your impressions
from the side

696
00:45:05,849 --> 00:45:09,529
because and with the silicone based
material

697
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:12,599
you know you gently cuts at the edges

698
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:18,339
and it work work out just fine because
the because it's it's flexible

699
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:22,569
a.m. we managed to make copy works fine

700
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:26,529
and that shows that that with the
silicone thing you can do

701
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:33,469
key stat: cannot be done in and in a
different way

702
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:37,950
a.m. on an IV said that Vienna

703
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,300
couple of weeks ago maybe months time
flies

704
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,560
a.m. and there's a company called Coba

705
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,400
and if you talk about looks made like a
watch

706
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,930
you know these locks I made like a watch
its so xx

707
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,259
so precise its really really really

708
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,820
one of the most for

709
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,790
high tolerance locks that I know the

710
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:08,529
they have more than one been in there
they have sometimes up to 22

711
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:11,590
positions where bins are from four
angles

712
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:15,120
and the pins are really small and really
pointy

713
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:18,690
and if you try to pick its you know we
we

714
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,090
of course tried to pick it if you put
tension on you start breaking in and out

715
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:27,210
the the local absence start to run less
smooth

716
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:31,170
it's it's very easy to disturb the lock
by

717
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:34,570
if you damage it or you know if you do
these kind of things

718
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,070
it is very difficult to pick it it's
very difficult to manipulate it

719
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:41,580
and it actually was the reason that I
bought this

720
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,000
silicone impression Inc because you know
we were going to the factory and I just

721
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,640
wanted to have something that I could
break the locks one way or the other

722
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,960
so yeah this is what I did

723
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,130
but I was I was really annoyed thats

724
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:58,250
a.m. I couldn't make this key

725
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,270
with my click it because what happens in

726
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:05,460
you can clearly see it here at the at
the bottom now

727
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:12,460
a point about for you

728
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:20,240
as you can see on the previous cream

729
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,390
that the pins on acaba

730
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:28,140
are got on a 45 degree angle meaning
that if I put it in a

731
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,480
in a clam and I remove it a.m.

732
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,580
uses with the case old but then much
more severe I will distorts

733
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,790
the the gaps and especially since it's
such a high security

734
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,480
high tolerance lock a.m.

735
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,000
IIIi I couldn't get it to work and it
really frustrated mean I really tried

736
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,090
you know with different angles with the
click it but it didn't work

737
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:55,640
a.m. butts with the silicon kits it
works

738
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:59,410
and the they weren't happy but yeah you
know that's life

739
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,670
a no but seriously I mean you know it's
its

740
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:05,890
it's the top of the line of European
high-security locks

741
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:11,330
and you know that day they should be
able to take them in

742
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,490
so a.m.

743
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,610
that more or less converse the

744
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:21,130
I'm the

745
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,330
the thing with I did with its our own
little research

746
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:29,700
on on high security locks copying there
is a difference that I want to point out

747
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,740
between

748
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,980
clay and silicone the clay kids

749
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,380
if you prepare the clay and you prepare
your clam

750
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,890
and you somehow managed to put it in
your pocket you can make

751
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,770
an impression of any key did you can get
your hands on in 10 seconds

752
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:48,540
you know you put it in you squeeze it
you take it out gently

753
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,779
you stick it into your pockets carefully
and

754
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,220
you know of you go and and you made your
copy

755
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,220
the disadvantage of that kid is that
it's not as

756
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:01,480
accurate as with the silicone based off

757
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,960
but it's still very accurate and I
manage to cope

758
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,230
almost every key I tried with that so as
long as there's no

759
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:11,590
45-degree the cuts in it or

760
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:15,619
groups that are in a specific 45 degree
angle if it's

761
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:19,430
let key the most the time place is good
enough

762
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:22,509
now the advantage of silicone is that

763
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:25,900
a.m. it makes very high precision

764
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,830
copies if you should write the but

765
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:33,299
it slow it takes you 10 minutes drive

766
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,440
to let it dry you have to mix it on the
spot

767
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,940
you cannot you know have premixed so you
have to mix it def you alls

768
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:43,680
small little chemistry factory with you
a.m.

769
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,080
so these are the two differences

770
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:51,710
in the system now the locksmiths

771
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:55,000
also have a new toy the or new they have
a toy

772
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,260
that they use for copying high security
keys and its

773
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:04,010
and is it's called easy entry machine
and easy entry machinist

774
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,580
really a nice devices really great in
invention

775
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:10,950
what it does is it scans the

776
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:14,140
the upper side of the key thats never
cut

777
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,440
because to cut always starts off a
little bit away from the shoulder

778
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,570
a.m. and it scans that part

779
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:24,020
of the key with a very thin feeler and
then

780
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,460
you insert the blank that has no caught
in it at all

781
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,190
with the smiling face and then the
machine starts making the cuts

782
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,250
like it scant and you know after

783
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:38,530
a couple minutes you have a a blankie

784
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:44,180
to dads to the to deadlock and the nice
thing about this machine is that

785
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,629
even for intelligence agencies and entry
teams

786
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,089
have a special module that if you have a
picture

787
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,640
for key way that this small Photoshop
like

788
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,020
image where they can just roll the line
of that

789
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:03,150
that profile and they will cults %uh the
key

790
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:07,150
even if they don't have access to the
original blank or the original key

791
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,170
so that's that's really in a very nice
way

792
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,670
unfortunately is a little bit above my
budget so if

793
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,970
if if people here are into

794
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,200
you know milling machines and
computerize milling you know I

795
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,720
I'd like to have a talk with you because
maybe we can do this thing open source

796
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,890
and just I I would really like that to
have at the end of

797
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:34,890
mechanical protect its keys enough is
enough a.m.

798
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:39,000
now this is actually where hun Compton
where some

799
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,099
for anyway a.m. if you want you can

800
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:47,020
you can say something about sure okay

801
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,950
just on these are

802
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:55,619
used this shit

803
00:51:55,619 --> 00:52:00,130
these are these awesome looks out my
collection

804
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:04,500
and a.m. I these are keys which are

805
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,339
impossible to copy with this silicon
well with the clay kits

806
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:12,250
reasonable reason why they are
impossible to copy is defect

807
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:15,359
that they have movable elements what ATF

808
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,640
magnets in them and a.m.

809
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:22,150
you can't see for example the know to
look Beltre

810
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:25,700
left above everybody knows that present
interactive

811
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:30,560
element in its and to some party in the
Lok must be lifted up

812
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,049
to for release a certain been to let

813
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:38,410
plug rotate a.m. another trick we see is

814
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:43,868
another tick we see for example

815
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,890
are okay

816
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,830
is for example the fr MCS that says

817
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:56,720
that's a cylinder with for make its
units then we have to

818
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,800
okay 8 make a scene if

819
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:04,500
then we have debris car number one which
has a floating element

820
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,600
element in it in the top then we have

821
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,130
the if a hacer which have a floating

822
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:16,320
or a spring element in the table to keep
the pointed very

823
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,990
here number three no no bilo bilo bilo
that one and I'll

824
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,109
the tip dip you see that dip that

825
00:53:23,109 --> 00:53:26,420
dip is sprint and therefore

826
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:29,630
that key cannot be got beat by molding

827
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,830
a.m. we have here to buy lock also

828
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:36,799
the know what I think by a lot of
americans be loader is

829
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,730
an element which to rotates or or

830
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,510
makes a 90-degree rotation to push
something in the Lok

831
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,240
the and then we have to motor

832
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,680
which he had a number one which have and

833
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,680
the micatin its and the most curious
thing

834
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,930
the the most to lose key I found in my a

835
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:06,930
collection was the number Fife and each
with a simple looks

836
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,920
zipper locks so it's it's the same thing
you close your offense which

837
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:17,869
and as you can see here

838
00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:21,119
it's a key which exists of a

839
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,580
a lose elements just like super

840
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,670
flexible the elements which go into the
lock

841
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:34,100
and which go into elaborate in the look
and then it moves that way like a fish

842
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,859
and then it sets depends

843
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,190
so it's it's a very extreme and strange
look

844
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:44,570
it's a it's a main effect which does not
exist anymore because looks were too

845
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:45,850
expensive

846
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,980
one a.m.

847
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,119
I don't know if you have more sheets
from the body

848
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:59,119
okay then I can go from

849
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:04,869
okay so on can you hear me no

850
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:08,280
put okay does work

851
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:11,310
I'm dock so the these are some

852
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:15,109
a keys that you know we couldn't copy
with this technique

853
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:18,630
having said that a.m. and I stand with
that

854
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,140
no matter what you make mechanically if
you have a mechanical key

855
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,190
and I'm determined to make a copy a copy
it

856
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,730
you know that's it's just a matter of
time

857
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:32,010
all these keys are made in a factory in
couple of seconds

858
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:35,160
and then you have a lifetime to spend on

859
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,500
finding a way to make a copy so they
cannot win that game they can make it is

860
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:43,400
most difficult to us they can and I
think that for instance the number five

861
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,350
the the FR one with the magnets it's
really one of the most difficult ones

862
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:51,930
you should to a look it up on the
Internet to know exactly why because

863
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:56,069
so long story but it's it's really
secure lock and so are most of these

864
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:59,990
the here I'm

865
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:04,700
okay now people that know me noted I do
a lot of lockpicking

866
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,760
and you know the part that we just had
its

867
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,140
exactly one hour was about

868
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:16,650
a high-security locks a and making
copies of its so that was part one

869
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:19,810
another thing I want to tell you what
I've been up to

870
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:23,299
in regards to looks is I'm

871
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,940
impression Inc and it's with everything
that I do

872
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:30,220
it said look opening technique called
impression ng and

873
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,190
the last thing I did for for the last
two years his impression in person

874
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,480
impression ng

875
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,160
just as with 3 O's have to you know you
have to practice over and over and over

876
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,670
again

877
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:43,310
I've been practicing a lot

878
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:46,849
a.m. so what is impression Inc

879
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:51,040
a.m. impression ng requires that

880
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:54,210
you have a blank you have a file

881
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,600
you have some patience and some skillz
a.m.

882
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:02,369
I brought with me a book from my good
friend Oliver Dixon who

883
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:06,800
interested me in this two years ago he
finished his book

884
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,910
a I went over

885
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:12,940
I looked at it he explained to me how it
worked and

886
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,450
you noted was also the first day that I
opens a lock

887
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:20,470
with impression Inc and the nice thing
about depression is that's

888
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,130
a.m. at the end you will have a key

889
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,150
so once you have bypassed the lock

890
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,150
with impression Inc you have a working
key and it's very useful for locksmiths

891
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:35,290
and non-destructive entry team so
government deems that

892
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:39,609
you know are are allowed to search your
house or place tougher your house or

893
00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:40,500
whatever

894
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:45,270
allowed to open your locks a.m. and I've
learned that this is actually a method

895
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:49,270
that's in use up to these days because
it's such a powerful technique

896
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:54,520
to open locks a a secretly

897
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,910
it's not like look picking you know that
you can just more or less

898
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:01,960
start and and and it the new minutes
open some locks

899
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,580
it requires quite some skill and
practice and

900
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:10,049
but the upside is that if you succeed
you have a working key

901
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:13,170
and so you only are

902
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:16,710
challenging the law once if you win you
have one forever

903
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,650
well would lock picking if you open the
lock is great you can close it and then

904
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:21,339
you know

905
00:58:21,339 --> 00:58:24,509
you have to go all over again

906
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:27,660
a.m. it silent a and it's possible to

907
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,490
come back later you can you know work on
impression on look for a few minutes and

908
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:33,390
then

909
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:37,310
go away and then the next day dude a
couple more minutes

910
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:41,000
and for you know for for non-destructive
into teams that isn't

911
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,470
appealing thing that if you try to pick
a lock a.m.

912
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:49,049
you know if you go back to the lockers
reset

913
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:52,650
a.m. so what is impression Inc

914
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:56,430
I'm now this slide is from

915
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:59,640
different presentations or remember the
binding been make much sense because I

916
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,120
didn't talk about love picking up

917
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,020
a.m. but what happens is that if you if
you have a look

918
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:08,620
and in this position you want to turn it
to the rights

919
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:11,690
the look is not going to open because
the blue pin

920
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:15,870
is in the way right blue pin is
preventing the lock

921
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:20,250
from turning and that's actually a a
what we're going to use

922
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:25,650
in impression in a.m. this a few very
simple tools that you need

923
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:29,300
in order for successful impression ing
at them to do it

924
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,030
a you have file that's very important

925
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,740
you have some good lights some clamps

926
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:43,740
a.m. all explain what's reported with
depression is that you have a blankie

927
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:47,330
and that you have clem to hold that
blinky

928
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:50,830
and what you will do is you will insert
a blank into the clamp

929
00:59:50,830 --> 00:59:54,279
and if you stick it into the look
nothing will happen except that all the

930
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:55,970
pins are raced as high as you can

931
00:59:55,970 --> 01:00:00,040
this is suspended blinky

932
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:03,630
and if you look on the top of the
blankie

933
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,950
you see it shining its it's got the
silver

934
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:10,720
colour to or chrome nickel chrome no
chrome

935
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:15,570
layer on top and with impression it's
important that we

936
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,910
brush that off so with a very fine file

937
01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:22,049
I make the surfers one smooth of

938
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:26,210
of you know so I remove the Hartshill
for layer

939
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,490
and get two brass and the and make it
once moved line

940
01:00:30,490 --> 01:00:35,170
of of Bryce well then do

941
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:39,680
is I insert a blank into the lock
alternate 22 rights

942
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,530
and by turning to the right one or two
pins

943
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:47,250
will be jamming the lock from opening as
we know we look picking

944
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:51,000
if you turn to the right it's not all
the pins that bind it's always one or

945
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,520
two

946
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,660
maybe three beings that bind so you turn
it in

947
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:58,549
to write been say okay you know I'm
stopping you from turning

948
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:02,060
now with impression ng you start

949
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:06,940
rocking your key up and down a little
bit now it's its in the

950
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,370
locketts in the keyway so there's not a
whole lot of play

951
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,430
you notice only a very minimal movement
that you can make however

952
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:17,510
the pins are jam between the house and
the core

953
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,610
and if I try to make a movements you
know something has got

954
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:25,680
is as gotta move so it's I did to keep
his gotta move for its dependence gotta

955
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:25,950
move

956
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:29,490
well I use a little bit more force to I

957
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:32,740
will actually lifted bins up just a
fraction of a millimeter

958
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:36,110
you know it's very little however that
will make a dent

959
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:39,350
in the middle and it will tell me later

960
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:45,640
page you know this is where been is
jamming here comes in

961
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,400
a after this round of you know it
shouldn't be key

962
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,500
turning to the left making a few
up-and-down movement

963
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:57,130
turning to the right making a few
up-and-down movement because if you turn

964
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,250
the key to the rights

965
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:02,390
this other pins binding if you turn it
to the left because

966
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:06,270
that's the way with the in perfect locks
you know how they all work that's but

967
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:07,930
I've been talking about for years now

968
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:12,090
that these mechanical tolerances make

969
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:15,550
is why

970
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:19,830
the steez looks can be picked so if I
plight or to the left

971
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:22,910
I get other marks than if I plight or to
the right

972
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:26,720
and if I look at my blankie a

973
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,810
under this little magnifier with
indirect lighting I have

974
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,620
or I use it under DL is

975
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:38,290
spot in the US Steel fluorescent lights

976
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:41,470
the troops yeah

977
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:46,850
okay fluorescent thing is if you shine
on the blink directly

978
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,980
it's coming back to your face and you
can see the very fine

979
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,250
marks the to make but this is actually

980
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:56,310
and image of a of a key that's

981
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:59,730
gone through the first round impression
ng and you can actually see

982
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:04,220
on the side of the blank I want to 345
cuts

983
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:07,690
so that means that I can actually see
all the pins

984
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:11,600
we're preventing the law from turning
when doing left and right a.m.

985
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,670
which is exceptional make most of the
time it's like

986
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:18,160
3 or you know three or four

987
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:21,759
but this in this case you know we've
seen all five

988
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,950
and what you do with depression Inc is a

989
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,260
this is this by the way I a
microscopical few of

990
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:32,630
what's going on and I'm not sure how
well you can see it

991
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:36,330
but that's really a clear mark and most
the time

992
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:40,160
that's that's not the case but the Marco
that you see over there

993
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,819
is typical from from from what its

994
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,710
from from what a real impression mark
looks like and by the way these images

995
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:48,860
are from the book

996
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:53,260
from all over the deck so the guy did
taught me aboard a few of these books

997
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,720
with me so if you're interested you know
I have only a few of them

998
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,260
with me so if you really want we can
talk now I can

999
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:04,350
so you can book a.m. but what happens is
that

1000
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,770
I see that the smooth better and he's
disturbed

1001
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,960
I see a dot and where she did not

1002
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,860
ifile and I have my round file and where
I see

1003
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:18,080
mark I will use my round file and got it

1004
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,170
now I can cut its in two different ways
I can use

1005
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,850
caliber and no two steps increments

1006
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:30,540
as we've seen from one of the first
lights it's all fixed distances

1007
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,759
I can use the caliber to say okay this
was a cut 0

1008
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,250
we now go to got one and do it exactly
as you can

1009
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:41,260
or you can say you know I don't minds

1010
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,690
these these exact numbers if I see a
heavy Marco go deep

1011
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,220
ever see a light mark I'll take it
slowly and you know that's where the

1012
01:04:49,220 --> 01:04:50,760
practice crime scene

1013
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,590
a once you learn how to read these marks
you know how to deep

1014
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:59,000
you know how deep to file a.m. and if
you see Mark

1015
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,700
you file them away if you don't see Mark
don't touch it

1016
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,780
that's the basic protocol in impression
ng

1017
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:11,170
a if you are looking with your

1018
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:14,840
with your little optics and you think

1019
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,460
is a mark horses know Mark is this you
know maybe pollution

1020
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,640
uses what what is this don't touch it

1021
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,259
if you will file it away a.m. the

1022
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,650
the the the bottom pin will

1023
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:32,110
go be low shear line and poppin will
start to bind

1024
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:35,980
and then you lost you can never go where
back up again so

1025
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,980
you have to be careful whatever you do
you know don't file too deep

1026
01:05:38,980 --> 01:05:42,250
because then you lost for ever you
cannot win the

1027
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:45,700
game refreshing anymore a.m. if in doubt

1028
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,790
leavitt because once it you know if it's
a five pin lock

1029
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:53,440
if 4 pins are in a row you know the
number five will scream

1030
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,100
with a very big marching okay here I am
you know this is where you have to file

1031
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:02,050
and if it stays that be uses the market
said no mark

1032
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:05,770
leave it like this a another thing that
you

1033
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:09,300
you have to train with impression is
don't use too much force

1034
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,770
I mean Israel relatively easy to break
the brush blanks

1035
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:16,650
at the beginning you know I broken like
like like matchsticks

1036
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:20,340
but now I hardly ever break them anymore
and that's because I've been

1037
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,080
practicing a lot

1038
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,950
this is actually my first successful key
and I was really thrilled

1039
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:31,650
that after meeting with oliver I went
home and I tried it

1040
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:35,030
and my first ride it worked as you can
see

1041
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,910
there's a little crack here on the on
the shoulder side

1042
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,950
so you know I was lucky that the key
wasn't too deep

1043
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:45,180
if the key has got a lot of $19.8 sinem

1044
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,860
it takes you much longer to do it

1045
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:53,340
a.m. but for 12 months after my for
successful key and that this you know

1046
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,660
pressuring approaching a freshening I be
making at least one

1047
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:01,100
successful opening a day with this
technique just

1048
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,210
because I think it's so much fun it's so
nice to be able to do it

1049
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:09,340
a.m. and II study the subject it's not
only

1050
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:12,580
that if I have a blank I can open the
lock

1051
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,590
it also forced me to study you know

1052
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:18,780
what looks are out there what is a
popular

1053
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:21,880
in the Netherlands what do you expect if
you go to a door

1054
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,910
because nowadays ices 24-hour look
service

1055
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:30,370
in opening doors people lost their keys
and if it's in my area

1056
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,930
they sometimes give me a call you know
okay that sounds like a very nice guy

1057
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:37,560
you know go help him out so we don't
have to drill the lock or whatever

1058
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:42,270
a and I have with me 50 kilograms I
don't know how much it is in

1059
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:45,270
inbounds but fifty

1060
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:49,290
it's a nice fifteen 15

1061
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,360
okay this is thirty-something bounce
a.m.

1062
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:56,340
with key stat: have strings of three
keys for

1063
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:00,530
for profile that I'm about to expect if
it's not a popular pro

1064
01:08:00,530 --> 01:08:04,120
profile five or six when is a popular
profile

1065
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:08,330
a.m. because you know if you spent three
keys on a lot you don't open it

1066
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:13,000
it's at least 10 minutes per try you
know that's that's the bare minimum

1067
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:17,180
so if you haven't opened the look of a
thirty minute with impression ng

1068
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:20,210
its were its uses anyway but a

1069
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:24,950
and I've been quite successful in this a
a the times that I open these locks in

1070
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,839
the field

1071
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:29,420
is between 10 minutes and thirty minutes
and the people are really happy

1072
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,130
you know that I I'm able to help them
doing that you know some eyebrows are

1073
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,310
being like

1074
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,600
what's this guy doing but if the door
opens and you know

1075
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:41,520
nothing is damaged the most the time
happy

1076
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:45,940
a.m. not interesting thing is that

1077
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:49,890
this technique works on wide range

1078
01:08:49,890 --> 01:08:54,940
flocks offer was one of the first people
I think

1079
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:58,880
to find out but maybe I'm wrong but at
least it's he's the one at that

1080
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,600
told me that it also works on the
bookies

1081
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,360
as we learned you know these these for
instance the cicadas so

1082
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:10,189
sergeant geisha locks they have pins
from three sides

1083
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:13,430
a.m. normally the holes are drilled in
the key

1084
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:17,280
but with impression ng what you do issue
just file

1085
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,979
over the whole length of the blank
because what you want is you want to

1086
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:21,500
keep

1087
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:26,479
to go deeper you you do not care that is
not the nicely drilled hole

1088
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,470
the key is in the way and it just wants
to go down and

1089
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:34,160
it there's only one roof bins for side

1090
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,779
you know so its it's no problem to

1091
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:42,279
to use a file and would like that and
people look at you really funny if you

1092
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,420
if you have one of these keys with you

1093
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:49,220
and they used to seeing no drills whole

1094
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:53,140
and yeah it's but it's it's a really
powerful technique

1095
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:56,730
that if you march 3 you know you can
open a lot of what we did

1096
01:09:56,730 --> 01:10:00,720
including lever locks dimple locks

1097
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,150
and its really a fun challenge for me to
do it and

1098
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:07,570
I hardly ever practice picking anymore
because I'm

1099
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,599
I'm really obsessed a little bit by by
this

1100
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:14,230
so if you have blinky you know any
blinky

1101
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:17,890
especially the high security profiles
you know come talk to me

1102
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,370
all I'll trade you /url work something
out with you

1103
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:25,349
a and

1104
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:28,760
that that's that's that's the
presentation and it went

1105
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,290
relatively fast so we have for quite
some time for

1106
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:38,010
for questions under you wanna join

1107
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:42,070
what do you want okay if you're
interested on can do a small

1108
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:44,160
presentation about the special ok

1109
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:48,639
that's the robot the key system so i i
think that

1110
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:53,290
maybe that would be a good idea

1111
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,390
sorry i am.

1112
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:59,860
let's say that were asking questions
until the setting up his laptop

1113
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:02,950
and somebody assisting with setting up
the laptop

1114
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:07,849
last technique you showed right the old
school way of doing that was to also

1115
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:11,630
take a match and deposits carpet on the
key

1116
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,830
that's correct and that way you could
see this a little easier how does that

1117
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:17,100
compare to what you doing here at every
witness

1118
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,470
oppression into the what what you're
saying is indeed

1119
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:24,440
that the old school locksmiths and it's
also the booklets that I read

1120
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:29,150
they use a kennel and the what is called
carbon carbon C you can apply at the

1121
01:11:29,150 --> 01:11:33,269
carbon that comes off of the the flame

1122
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,660
is used to Lekan the layer

1123
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:40,580
on the other hand all the for found out
that if you have a brass blank

1124
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:44,110
the brush is much softer than the bins
in the lock

1125
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:47,570
and they will make an impression because
you noticed you pin

1126
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:51,420
is bound and you going to push it up
with something that's much softer

1127
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:54,960
it will make a mark so so there's no
need in using

1128
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,110
eating or carbon or whatever

1129
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:03,070
into that and I i noted in the books it
says you know use a candle and do it

1130
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:06,570
but he tried it for a long time all
these techniques and

1131
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:09,580
you really study did I mean you should
you should read this book it's is really

1132
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,360
good

1133
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:14,549
a.m. and and it's it's not necessary if
you have a

1134
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:18,170
brass blink right maybe the blacks were
weren't brass backed yeah maybe fits

1135
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,640
Stihl you know it's much more

1136
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,400
different more difficult to mark but
think thanks for the question

1137
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,490
curved use really all

1138
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:29,950
word walks like

1139
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:33,500
of lost long

1140
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,580
nowadays use carbon or car magic marker
whatever

1141
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:41,640
the pic force pushing down is enough for

1142
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:44,640
I rub off sharpy's the market overall

1143
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,040
you speak all always work

1144
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:53,670
I a question about the magnetic ease
okay on when you see the magazine side

1145
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:57,880
is the only thing that you have to worry
about larry is it either just

1146
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:02,620
or minuses organizations the nice thing
with the magnetic key system from ever

1147
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:06,150
what you're talking about is around
magnets is that inside

1148
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:09,200
is a disc and the disc is on a spindle

1149
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,570
so it can freely rotate if you insert
the key

1150
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:16,049
it will take this freely rotating disk

1151
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:19,590
and it will position it in a specific
way and on

1152
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:23,120
one part of this there's a little cuts
into this

1153
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:26,130
and if although this Caroline and an

1154
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:30,090
I have with me a cutaway version of this
system

1155
01:13:30,090 --> 01:13:34,340
so if you if you meet us downstairs at
the lockpick village I can show you

1156
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:39,060
the internals of that lock and you know
it's it's a beautiful piece of art

1157
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,560
great thank you York

1158
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,170
Eric very little Eric I

1159
01:13:46,170 --> 01:13:49,800
okay have you tried modifying your legal
high-security

1160
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,230
hope one

1161
01:13:53,230 --> 01:13:56,870
cake to do you second guess you could
use a dirtier the country

1162
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:01,490
it's not possible you the USB plugs into
the USB port

1163
01:14:01,490 --> 01:14:04,990
yeah I I love you I i love you too

1164
01:14:04,990 --> 01:14:09,150
yes so have you tried modifying your
high security key copies

1165
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:12,450
so that they will trigger the moving
mechanism

1166
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:16,889
or have you tried using a a picture
paper clip for

1167
01:14:16,890 --> 01:14:19,940
in Chennai you that that's actually a
really good question

1168
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:24,090
I wanted to to do that I wanted to have
in this presentation

1169
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:28,580
a key a a that was one of the key set
that hun said

1170
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:32,840
could not be done and indeed you know
whether moving element is drilling the

1171
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,400
way

1172
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:36,780
and make some paper clip Dutch above the

1173
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:39,820
the the line but the simply was not
enough time

1174
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:43,509
but I'm convinced and that's again what
I say you know if it's about mechanical

1175
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:44,080
locks

1176
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,210
de Luz its you know if you wanna make

1177
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:51,310
mechanical piece if you wanna make peace
metal that will operate deadlock

1178
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:55,350
it will work yeah as thing the more tour
with them magnet in the key I have

1179
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:56,159
little magnets

1180
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59,449
great their cup the show it's it's its

1181
01:14:59,449 --> 01:15:04,940
now it's it's it's not a big deal new
showing the

1182
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:08,690
silicon morning as wonder if that gave
of any smell that may give you away

1183
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,270
when you're using that technique a when
when I was first

1184
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:16,070
showing it to harm he says feels like
I'm in the dentist now

1185
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:19,820
if know it's also it's just that it does
have a a little smell

1186
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:26,820
but it's not like in a chemical plant or
anything it yet

1187
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:31,510
you said that the click it had a problem
with the

1188
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,100
the key he made didn't last very long
visit you would wear way when you put it

1189
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:35,810
in the lock

1190
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,699
a there's a a technique that used for
modeling

1191
01:15:39,699 --> 01:15:44,090
where you say and a pox a to you feel
them all the party many fire in the

1192
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:44,460
other

1193
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:48,730
and I think you make it something a bit
harder cuz I eisin that's like letter

1194
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:49,230
pewter

1195
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:53,590
or something Lee pretty soft yeah well
I'm thanks for the advice I will

1196
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,940
definitely look into that i i havent
heard about that but it makes a lot of

1197
01:15:56,940 --> 01:15:57,639
sense

1198
01:15:57,639 --> 01:16:01,760
to use only proxy and having it hard in
out I just repeat the question because

1199
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:02,770
I'm not sure if

1200
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:06,320
a but I I will look into that

1201
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,480
what's the name of the I I'm not sure if
it has a name but if you look up

1202
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:13,650
aka its use for like making figurines
and things

1203
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:18,130
okay thanks I'll look a look that up
that that's a familiar face coming up

1204
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:18,460
now

1205
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:21,989
alright will first thing is coming media
said

1206
01:16:21,989 --> 01:16:26,230
actually I've got the impression excuse
the pun it on a call at such

1207
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:29,920
that you don't actually use the clay
open anything im

1208
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,849
you're making something with some other
material so I'll sergei's

1209
01:16:33,849 --> 01:16:37,730
soon that would be so where should be an
issue actually I think about proxy bid

1210
01:16:37,730 --> 01:16:40,730
rocks myself as a possible to make an
actual key

1211
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:44,110
its Kim the minimum quite strong now
different different

1212
01:16:44,110 --> 01:16:48,290
question on okay you talking about
especially power

1213
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:51,630
s also look on multi-part product from
be somewhat he said

1214
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:55,840
anti I have a very difficult time
understanding you okay let me take you

1215
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,530
make the question short and brief
compact thing clear:

1216
01:16:59,530 --> 01:17:03,009
between more time your me back miss to
close

1217
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:08,830
house at a better 23 de vere okay with
my question was but this was

1218
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:11,849
okay it's a fancy product using mixed in
I parks

1219
01:17:11,849 --> 01:17:14,929
I mean a silicon mix my question is what
about normal

1220
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:19,150
RTV single part apart I mean this
electronic you might use for other

1221
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,040
things such as squawking or other things

1222
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,750
they're pretty robbery as well would
probably still hold on an angle

1223
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:28,340
have it right something like that
because that would be a lot cheaper and

1224
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,580
I C span probably be a lot simpler to
work with if we have the right

1225
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:32,599
characteristics

1226
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:36,929
so the more common aim would be to do is
carry able to be a pocket with that way

1227
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:42,120
by mixing stuff for anything else

1228
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,469
you lost your know it's normal to look
on the two but a one-part product you

1229
01:17:46,469 --> 01:17:47,510
don't mix anything

1230
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:50,920
nobody getting all the hardware store
use a quarter past

1231
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:55,330
top or whatever still so a chorus of
three robbery it was still survive does

1232
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:57,380
angled cuts I would think if you get a
good one

1233
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:00,540
maybe I dunno you might be worth trying

1234
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:04,830
got set for as far as the market marking
materials from freshening

1235
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:08,290
I never found with modern locks much
lock

1236
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:12,790
with dumb with the sort method but
actually marker if these are

1237
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:17,310
a good permanent marker start some walks
can be helpful me I'm for things I said

1238
01:18:17,310 --> 01:18:21,280
I found in fact can be useful sometimes
but I'ma lock

1239
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:27,530
okay on I'm wondering what kinda medals
you use for the clay molding

1240
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:30,580
a.m. dead it's a good question no I
bought

1241
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:34,059
these kids completes and it's it's a
relatively soft

1242
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:37,310
the metal that will melt at very low
temperatures like

1243
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:41,150
like with with the candle so is it like
let me think

1244
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:46,239
its it's probably some compound would
lead and sink in

1245
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:49,250
or

1246
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:52,810
what's what's what's what's a caller

1247
01:18:52,810 --> 01:18:56,750
what's meddler or you're gonna worry
okay thanks Eric

1248
01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:00,949
right on ok what are your views on the

1249
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:05,070
electronic authentication over keys from
the locks

1250
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:09,349
in with that extra layer of security so
even if you did

1251
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:14,030
copy the key with you your message that
you talked about

1252
01:19:14,030 --> 01:19:18,400
in the key would still not over nor its
ok that's a good question because

1253
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,820
I specifically said during my
presentation mechanical locks mechanical

1254
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,360
locks pieces of metal and chemical
mechanical mechanical no

1255
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,530
but but but you're right because there's
now a lot of electro mechanical locks on

1256
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,090
the market

1257
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:34,730
and they obviously you know in theory
would not have these problems that you

1258
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:35,810
could copy them because

1259
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:39,570
the challenge response cryptography in
these chips is really strong

1260
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:43,000
in some cases however if people a read
my

1261
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,989
my weblog problem weeks ago there's
there's people out there with

1262
01:19:46,989 --> 01:19:51,660
very very sophisticated clever simple
techniques to bypass some of the

1263
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:55,590
electro mechanical locks and a at this
moment as we speak

1264
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,630
you know we're in close contact with one
of the biggest

1265
01:19:58,630 --> 01:20:02,010
manufacturers who have an
electromechanical ok

1266
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,550
that can be bypassed with the simple
ring with a few magnets

1267
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:08,870
if you twist the ring in the area in the
surface of

1268
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:12,280
this electromagnetic lock it will unlock

1269
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:16,190
the electronic part because would not we
don't know exactly why

1270
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:20,219
that happens it could be that the little
motor that blocks

1271
01:20:20,219 --> 01:20:22,430
the the

1272
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:25,219
lock by turning is magnetic field around

1273
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:28,930
will actually removed the blocking
element or

1274
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:31,980
it could also be that by inducing
magnetic

1275
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,710
changing magnetic field and if this
coral anywhere on the POF

1276
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:38,760
of off thats you know if the unlocking
mechanical

1277
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:43,160
electronic element current could be
induced

1278
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:46,739
on that wire and all of a sudden you
know things going can happen

1279
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:49,810
that so its nice to think that

1280
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:54,360
electronics is the answer but I think
that we're just at the very beginning

1281
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,360
of where this is going and this is not
anywhere near

1282
01:20:57,360 --> 01:21:01,059
solution that says of used electronics
it's rick's forever

1283
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:04,420
but it definitely is a good help II
definitely have to say that

1284
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:09,370
that but that's the the best defense you
have at the moment thanks

1285
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:12,570
yeah

1286
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:15,730
kinda lost my voice her soul okay but I
am

1287
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:19,030
I use to make small molds for car parts
&

1288
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:22,190
I would take arm goal pager

1289
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:26,670
what with the vibrate molded and hold
that up next to the mall to those porn

1290
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,310
madeleine

1291
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:31,550
and it vibrated what kinda by take the
bottles are other

1292
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:34,900
the mold when I was pouring in I don't
know if you could use that with the key

1293
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:35,739
or not but

1294
01:21:35,739 --> 01:21:38,989
that makes a lot of sense thanks did
everybody get because it was actually

1295
01:21:38,989 --> 01:21:40,150
quite a good idea

1296
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:44,200
to use a little vibrating element on
your key mold

1297
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:48,139
then if you insert the metal the whole
thing is already shaking

1298
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:51,610
you have to be careful with your fingers
though because this hot metal

1299
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:56,730
is hot but the next said question by my
work key

1300
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:59,730
I was under the impression it's the
emblem ass fucking

1301
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:03,290
that you get their different
combinations that you could

1302
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:07,080
different you could set the lock itself
with different combinations like mines

1303
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,010
green tea

1304
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:11,580
I'm a boss has the red key I'm how would
you go about

1305
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:15,170
up finding which Q work with that
particular bach

1306
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:19,430
special one that was hard copy like this
one a.m.

1307
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:23,800
well this this been a whole discussion I
think maybe four years ago by

1308
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:27,030
met blaze a mark Tobias who found out
the way

1309
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:31,330
to you know if you know some keys
animosity system even if you know one

1310
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:34,940
how to crack March the key systems and
how to calculate

1311
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:39,250
the monster in a system what it looks
like and most of the time if you have

1312
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,540
access to one key or from marcia key
system

1313
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,930
and this is a general speaking a.m.

1314
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:48,340
then than the system uses compromised
and you know you can

1315
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:51,730
you can open all the doors if you are
determined enough to

1316
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:54,810
to do detect s

1317
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:58,060
blaze into buyers have laid out even
with the

1318
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:02,030
the side pens that down you need to find
a blank I guess

1319
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:05,340
well I would expect for horses for
courses about about making your own

1320
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,460
blanks and stuff

1321
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,670
so the the blank is not the problem

1322
01:23:09,670 --> 01:23:13,090
I mean if you are determined enough its

1323
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,980
own is only be two metal with some
groups in some holes consonant is

1324
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,200
nothing more nothing less

1325
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,239
and it takes determination especially
with the mall to look interactive look

1326
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,219
that you have there

1327
01:23:23,219 --> 01:23:27,120
right I don't say easy but on the other
hand you know if you would give the key

1328
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,250
to me for

1329
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:33,560
for 20 minutes or no for for 20 seconds
I make a detailed photocopy of it

1330
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,830
and I give you a week later I give your
key when I'm back in the Netherlands

1331
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:40,140
and i jus reads how deep it is and what
combination is

1332
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,860
am most likely I mean I cannot say with
100 percent certainty but

1333
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:47,000
with a high degree of secure certainty I
can make that

1334
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,500
that key for you without seeing data
over again

1335
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:56,130
my you sir Skyler

1336
01:23:56,130 --> 01:24:00,719
a very as wondering

1337
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,500
do I companies implement things in the
locks is particular pins

1338
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:08,780
anything like that to specifically for
impression oh yes

1339
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:12,150
there are some things a for instance
dome

1340
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:15,940
makes a pin that is a bottom mushroom

1341
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:19,350
been all the mushroom pins are toppings
normally

1342
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,190
a.m. and we picking it's very
frustrating because then you pick and

1343
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:24,310
you have no idea how

1344
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:27,780
the locus turning but actually the
mushroom been is in the way

1345
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:32,300
Ando makes these pins bottom pins with
impression you never have problems with

1346
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:32,960
mushrooms

1347
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:36,860
as a matter fact if you look turns like
it's

1348
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:40,759
its in a mushroom it's an indication
okay dude you went too deep

1349
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:44,060
because now you have reached in a pin
thats normally on top

1350
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:49,690
of the bottom pins it's not so good I i
think it's a clear enough

1351
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:54,760
I think a.m. so that's that's with to a
impression ng and and

1352
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:58,080
key specifically or been specifically
for that purpose

1353
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,080
so and I've also seen them in French
locker I think for ships

1354
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:09,080
also has them time

1355
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:15,460
Mont next I'm

1356
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:19,230
um at the noticing that allow the
European keys are actually

1357
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,280
will be more secure than once the United
States just by

1358
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:25,590
just representation for example no I'm
wondering

1359
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:29,890
how easy is it to import European marks
into United States

1360
01:25:29,890 --> 01:25:33,200
meaning like by one from Europe getting
mail to me

1361
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:37,130
United States a.m. well you should talk
to him about that

1362
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:40,550
on lisa is a %uh expert on that field

1363
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:44,140
the also can maybe deliver some US

1364
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:47,490
shaped I security locks and after the
presentation

1365
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,969
just meet up with him done says it
looked at Village and

1366
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:55,890
it will work out I think it yeah

1367
01:25:55,890 --> 01:26:02,890
okay why

1368
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:15,980
Canon City come

1369
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:18,020
my english is not to do this from Bari

1370
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:25,020
I suppose we'll go to gretchen okay

1371
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,500
I'll this sheet I found now its she'd

1372
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,700
a.m. which demonstrate the floating
thought

1373
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:43,080
in the key for the protection against
molding

1374
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:46,730
I don't know if people are interested if
they want to know how that works

1375
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:50,290
yes okay

1376
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:53,760
a.m. not woken we Okun

1377
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:57,990
imagine this is a dome each system and
there is a floating 5 in element

1378
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:01,490
and floating element in the key on the
left side

1379
01:27:01,490 --> 01:27:05,750
you see the key with a blue ball bearing
on the right side

1380
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:08,950
at errol a you can see

1381
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:12,490
expect chamber where r wrecked pin

1382
01:27:12,490 --> 01:27:15,490
and the Reds top and the button pin

1383
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:18,840
amounted in if a the spring

1384
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,580
pushes down the here

1385
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:26,019
pushes down

1386
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:29,860
a the toppin and the rotation is blocked

1387
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:33,900
if I insert the correct key there is a
blue ball bearing

1388
01:27:33,900 --> 01:27:37,480
the group or ball bearing lifts up the

1389
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:41,080
the the bottom pin and we have she line

1390
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,950
this is clear okay the trick is

1391
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:48,240
that the ball bearing has a certain
diameter

1392
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:52,330
so that you have to correct height a to
create a she line

1393
01:27:52,330 --> 01:27:55,440
if you look on the left a

1394
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,930
picture or a picture in the middle you
see ball

1395
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:02,720
blue been in the preps yeah we see that

1396
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,230
this Plurk is stock it's a fixed

1397
01:28:06,230 --> 01:28:10,070
block a.m. this block

1398
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:13,990
a.m. grievance did if you insert the key

1399
01:28:13,990 --> 01:28:17,710
which is not the milt deep enough

1400
01:28:17,710 --> 01:28:21,500
does not go in the whole way you
understate

1401
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,240
and on

1402
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:29,110
on dippers to keep there is partially

1403
01:28:29,110 --> 01:28:32,639
the the the key is milt in

1404
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,780
deeper and because the key is milt in
deeper

1405
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:39,090
it can go under the blue pin here

1406
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:46,090
so everybody understand so that

1407
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:50,970
now you can insert the key and

1408
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:54,730
an the but

1409
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:58,400
if you insert the key the wat I'll
pointed out is Matt

1410
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:05,400
if you

1411
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:10,470
insert the key a.m. deflation of the key
is the tight

1412
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:16,050
this this height I issue mules

1413
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,380
understand that and because the height
is

1414
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,510
not deep enough this reppin

1415
01:29:22,510 --> 01:29:25,700
rest below

1416
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:29,030
yeah and because stepped rest

1417
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:34,540
been rest below there is no she like him

1418
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:37,690
and therefore it does not rotate and

1419
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:41,270
the most clever trick is then the ball
bearing the ball bearing

1420
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:47,140
has the right height but

1421
01:29:47,140 --> 01:29:51,060
how do you get that's right height on
the right position

1422
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:57,230
if there is if it's been you understand

1423
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:00,460
and therefore they made a time when the
blacks

1424
01:30:00,460 --> 01:30:06,330
so that the ball bearing

1425
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:10,360
good go under its com at the correct
position

1426
01:30:10,360 --> 01:30:15,799
and lift the red been is this little

1427
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:19,570
okay this is a is an example of an
floating element

1428
01:30:19,570 --> 01:30:26,570
iniki the

1429
01:30:27,110 --> 01:30:30,610
in this is an example buddy show

1430
01:30:30,610 --> 01:30:34,969
before the this easy entry picture and

1431
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:38,580
the the easy entry pic the easy entry is

1432
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,780
milling machine and it

1433
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:45,900
it measures the profile of a key

1434
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:48,930
so so it's Ken stuckey

1435
01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:52,810
here and it put it somewhere in the
software

1436
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:57,590
and then a mill is activated and it
makes a copy of the key here

1437
01:30:57,590 --> 01:31:01,810
it Mills those tracks on the key

1438
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:08,000
so that the key will fit in the lock

1439
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:11,970
and a we visit the the company gay gay

1440
01:31:11,970 --> 01:31:15,690
gateway is a a big company and a

1441
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:19,560
there you have to text keep the next key
way on the left site

1442
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:22,680
and you can see in the circle undercut

1443
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:28,590
yeah it's it's a it's a it's it's a part
in a key way which takes out

1444
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:34,710
if you look straight on the key you can
see that the key looks like this

1445
01:31:34,710 --> 01:31:38,160
that's an origin okie if you

1446
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:42,559
den skin dickey which with at the easy
entry

1447
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:49,560
you scan the key like this

1448
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:57,220
yet but if you scan the key you don't
scan

1449
01:31:57,220 --> 01:32:04,220
the whole apart in the key yen

1450
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:07,820
depart dust machine Nazi sick leave

1451
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:11,120
and because dat machine

1452
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,170
does not see that part he just makes a
key

1453
01:32:14,170 --> 01:32:19,500
like this so

1454
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,650
the black part is so let yeah dusted
keefe

1455
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:28,090
does the disc e fit in the black yes or
no

1456
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,200
now okay so there were clever guys

1457
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:35,180
who set a.m. effete does not scan the
doc part here

1458
01:32:35,180 --> 01:32:38,739
ifile

1459
01:32:38,739 --> 01:32:45,739
the whole pie two-way and then I get
this key correct or not

1460
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:49,070
to does this keep fit in the keyway

1461
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:53,120
okay now this key fits the keyway
correct

1462
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:58,309
but

1463
01:32:58,310 --> 01:33:01,440
gay gay was clever and they did not like
that

1464
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:05,980
no because otherwise not people could
copy the key

1465
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:09,690
and we see on the left we see the
original key

1466
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:13,450
and we see that undercut in the middle

1467
01:33:13,450 --> 01:33:17,059
we see the key made with the easy entry
yeah

1468
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:20,930
and on the left right side we see the
key

1469
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:24,070
where we have filed away despite

1470
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:28,710
we all see that and

1471
01:33:28,710 --> 01:33:33,510
gave me was that clever that they insert
at an extra slider in the lock

1472
01:33:33,510 --> 01:33:38,180
and we can ship we can see that on the
left picture that slider

1473
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:41,590
their is blocked by going further

1474
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:45,140
because of this fighting the key you see

1475
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:49,420
on the left but you can see it you see
that that the red slider

1476
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:53,190
it cannot move to the left side yeah

1477
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:56,300
if I now have easy entry

1478
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:59,820
key which is to a

1479
01:33:59,820 --> 01:34:03,730
faked and I milt this away the slide it
goes in

1480
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:07,460
do we all see that

1481
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,560
and then the rotation of key will be
blocked after ninety degrees

1482
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:18,560
okay this was just a short what

1483
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:27,000
with the same a.m.

1484
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,610
week didn't

1485
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:36,400
we didn't find to wait till now yeah
okay keep it in the middle

1486
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,030
with you know show we make two questions
later

1487
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:45,489
okay I show you in short some

1488
01:34:45,489 --> 01:34:48,960
experience with it about them peace room

1489
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:52,270
I'll desist

1490
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,580
been s Cuyler refer to this is an
example of an

1491
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:59,750
don't mix and I think it's

1492
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:03,040
now you can see details of the prince so
let it be

1493
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:08,540
I'll

1494
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:15,540
and here is what I 16 to start my talk
I'm

1495
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:22,940
I have stream a.m.

1496
01:35:25,139 --> 01:35:32,139
in a moment much

1497
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:40,340
okay easy and now I now want to sell
something about the hockey s look

1498
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:43,380
a.m. and RTS stands for

1499
01:35:43,380 --> 01:35:47,290
robotic robotic key system this

1500
01:35:47,290 --> 01:35:50,480
RTS system is developed by states and
concepts

1501
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:54,239
it's an inventor and listen Stenton
nearby New York

1502
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:57,920
and it's the world its its wheels first

1503
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,440
open source looking system and I am then

1504
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:04,680
referring to the key and then referring
to the key

1505
01:36:04,680 --> 01:36:09,630
the key is motorized as you can see
there

1506
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:13,350
and and therefore we call it also

1507
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:16,650
a robotic E and the cylinder is purely

1508
01:36:16,650 --> 01:36:20,090
mechanical which is on the left a.m.

1509
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:23,820
with these robotic Tyler you can rotate

1510
01:36:23,820 --> 01:36:26,860
the discs in the cylinder

1511
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:30,059
so that the synagogues open this lock

1512
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:34,010
was first presented in snake in 2005 the

1513
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:37,739
G Lee we have with two the big event in
the Netherlands

1514
01:36:37,739 --> 01:36:41,040
that a Dutch Open during that event

1515
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:45,160
the people from France Germany United
States

1516
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:48,309
United Kingdom and the Netherlands
condemn

1517
01:36:48,310 --> 01:36:51,670
lot of lock pick a sandlot lock and to
just its

1518
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:55,370
and inventor demonstrated their his lock

1519
01:36:55,370 --> 01:36:59,360
that was in 2005 and people could play

1520
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,370
with a look they could give comments on
the look

1521
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:05,830
they could try to manipulate the look
and the inventor

1522
01:37:05,830 --> 01:37:10,250
went home with a lot of good ideas and

1523
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:13,760
US clever enough to implant to implement

1524
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,500
these improvements its to get a better
look so that it was more

1525
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:23,560
covered entry secured a.m.

1526
01:37:23,560 --> 01:37:28,900
okay a.m.

1527
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:32,290
the most strongest point about this look
is thats

1528
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:36,570
there is no hole on the inside you can
see the

1529
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:43,570
you can see this part on this great part

1530
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:51,910
comes to Tyler that's the tip of the
dialer

1531
01:37:51,910 --> 01:37:55,739
and if that dialer is placed

1532
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:59,370
on the cylinder it starts rotating

1533
01:37:59,370 --> 01:38:03,790
and just like a combination lock of the
safe was just like a public protector

1534
01:38:03,790 --> 01:38:06,130
the disc start rotating

1535
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:10,199
and one by one they getting the correct
position so that the looking back in

1536
01:38:10,199 --> 01:38:10,679
dropping

1537
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:14,679
yeah its it's a very special mechanism

1538
01:38:14,679 --> 01:38:19,699
now

1539
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:23,520
these are some over thoughts the the

1540
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:27,150
inventor hat a.m.

1541
01:38:27,150 --> 01:38:30,160
he wanted to he developed this look

1542
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:33,750
in first instance for to the to

1543
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:36,790
for the container transports

1544
01:38:36,790 --> 01:38:41,290
a.m. because he said there were some
problems with the contains

1545
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:44,530
a.m. there were case of P lost et cetera

1546
01:38:44,530 --> 01:38:47,949
and you can imagine if you have a
container

1547
01:38:47,949 --> 01:38:51,690
you ship this from China to the United
States

1548
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:54,850
how do you den Handel with the customs

1549
01:38:54,850 --> 01:38:57,860
on route because as we all know

1550
01:38:57,860 --> 01:39:01,820
the customs a has the authority to open

1551
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:04,900
to to inspect the container between

1552
01:39:04,900 --> 01:39:08,510
China and America and the point loss

1553
01:39:08,510 --> 01:39:12,330
you could put the below commit a padlock

1554
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:17,219
and then you put the key from the pet
luck with that container

1555
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:20,640
and then somebody could open the
container with a look remove stuff from

1556
01:39:20,640 --> 01:39:22,179
its and closed container again

1557
01:39:22,179 --> 01:39:26,150
and place the key back so that was not
the solution

1558
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:29,670
because it could not be tracked at the
container was opened

1559
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:32,960
if you put a lock on that container

1560
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,469
you sent to keep to China or to the US
and customs will check

1561
01:39:37,469 --> 01:39:41,170
that contain it to have to cut open the
lock so

1562
01:39:41,170 --> 01:39:44,610
that was also not the solution and
therefore they came with seals

1563
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:47,969
very clever solution

1564
01:39:47,969 --> 01:39:51,880
but and if you use the seals

1565
01:39:51,880 --> 01:39:55,469
after use they are at you can throw them
away

1566
01:39:55,469 --> 01:39:59,719
and they are not trackable they are hot
to track

1567
01:39:59,719 --> 01:40:03,080
and these were reasons to invented the
hockey a system

1568
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:07,429
these are

1569
01:40:07,429 --> 01:40:10,730
the pots in the cylinder I will go to

1570
01:40:10,730 --> 01:40:17,730
dry address less to say about this I
think this picture is clear

1571
01:40:19,219 --> 01:40:22,730
and Dez either boss in the cylinder

1572
01:40:22,730 --> 01:40:29,730
the in detail I want to show how to sit
in the works if I get this on

1573
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:40,800
okay

1574
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:55,180
here

1575
01:40:56,309 --> 01:41:03,309
here I have to salinity my aunt

1576
01:41:03,739 --> 01:41:09,239
incredible here

1577
01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:12,330
here I have to sheila Marie my aunt and

1578
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:15,640
the first thing what we can the first
thing what we can see

1579
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:18,790
are the discs and locking bar in it

1580
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:21,830
this is the front of the cylinder

1581
01:41:21,830 --> 01:41:25,180
and this is what we call the manual
dialer

1582
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:30,140
dismantled either

1583
01:41:30,140 --> 01:41:34,949
them is xx Lee a.m. the dialer

1584
01:41:34,949 --> 01:41:41,949
from a safe we can place these dialer

1585
01:41:42,530 --> 01:41:49,530
on RTS still in there

1586
01:41:51,489 --> 01:41:54,980
and if we rotate the dial we can see

1587
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:59,770
data disc start rotating I think

1588
01:41:59,770 --> 01:42:02,830
most of us are familiar with it
combination safe locks

1589
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:06,420
this now if you have a combination safe
locks

1590
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,360
a slocum you normally count till three
ordeal for

1591
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,060
and than US had all the disks and

1592
01:42:14,060 --> 01:42:18,190
their curious if somebody's how many
discs are in the look

1593
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:21,890
cough some people will sync up how many

1594
01:42:21,890 --> 01:42:28,890
Fife I thought there were

1595
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:32,699
fix okay now I rotate this look

1596
01:42:32,699 --> 01:42:36,710
and you can imagine a.m. the

1597
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:40,090
lost this so the discs the

1598
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:43,360
nectar the disc on the right this

1599
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:49,190
in the front of the Lok will be position
first so

1600
01:42:49,190 --> 01:42:53,590
and I wrote take no further and you can
see the chamber watergate I rotate its

1601
01:42:53,590 --> 01:43:00,590
it's a little bit stuck the first disc
is now aligned

1602
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:05,489
can everybody see that okay now that
means that we now

1603
01:43:05,489 --> 01:43:10,030
make 546 rotation back and then

1604
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:17,030
than this next disc will also be aligned
everybody see that

1605
01:43:18,330 --> 01:43:23,929
shopping of West you see it's okay

1606
01:43:23,929 --> 01:43:27,719
now we try to the we rotate to the right
and

1607
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:30,949
and this way we can open the lock

1608
01:43:30,949 --> 01:43:35,280
missus Henry or not yes

1609
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,590
is to secure or not yes it's secure

1610
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:42,320
because if you can if you can manipulate

1611
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:46,290
it's hot too many plates that 7

1612
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:50,620
or a six-disc safe lock is already hot
too many later

1613
01:43:50,620 --> 01:43:53,769
safe lock with three discs yeah

1614
01:43:53,770 --> 01:43:57,239
so this is a very secure lock but the
point with this is the

1615
01:43:57,239 --> 01:44:02,030
the minimal dialer is not handy because
it it takes the time to rotate

1616
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:05,870
that the combination and therefore the
invent the game

1617
01:44:05,870 --> 01:44:10,710
with this thing

1618
01:44:10,710 --> 01:44:15,560
and that's what he called the robotic
dialer and

1619
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:19,250
I now will insert a robotic are on the
look and then we'll see what happens

1620
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:26,250
okay

1621
01:44:33,820 --> 01:44:35,849
to top screen wait a moment

1622
01:44:35,849 --> 01:44:39,289
out Alka

1623
01:44:39,289 --> 01:44:42,340
now I do it again

1624
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:45,510
and we can see

1625
01:44:45,510 --> 01:44:49,999
that looking back goes in and

1626
01:44:49,999 --> 01:44:53,559
this is one of the nicest things about
the robotic a system

1627
01:44:53,559 --> 01:44:57,150
because normally used dialer to open the
lock

1628
01:44:57,150 --> 01:45:00,519
yeah but if you don't have the

1629
01:45:00,519 --> 01:45:04,139
robotic Tyler you only have two manual
dialer

1630
01:45:04,139 --> 01:45:07,519
it's possible that you get

1631
01:45:07,519 --> 01:45:10,909
combination from somebody and that you
can rotate it by hand

1632
01:45:10,909 --> 01:45:15,489
here I now I now doubt the combination
for you eight cell

1633
01:45:15,489 --> 01:45:20,969
it's now fully blocked am the cylinder
does not rotate

1634
01:45:20,969 --> 01:45:27,969
you see it blocks its stock its stock

1635
01:45:28,650 --> 01:45:32,619
I I pushing the top of the Roman
rebutted either

1636
01:45:32,619 --> 01:45:36,210
we see the key

1637
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:43,210
the the disc rotate and the look is open

1638
01:45:45,610 --> 01:45:48,720
yet point which is system is

1639
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:54,880
that a.m. dialing instructions can come
in by GSM or by GPS et cetera

1640
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,170
so this is the way customs can open

1641
01:45:58,170 --> 01:46:02,360
deadlock on the way and

1642
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:09,280
get there is a lot to tell about there
is a lot to tell about

1643
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,370
the how to look exactly works because
they only shalt

1644
01:46:12,370 --> 01:46:15,410
how to open it and and

1645
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:18,910
I think I can invite everybody to the

1646
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:22,050
to the lockpick village there we have
John Laughlin

1647
01:46:22,050 --> 01:46:25,860
John Laughlin is one of the inventors of
the system he has

1648
01:46:25,860 --> 01:46:29,739
some stuff with him so that everybody
can play with it just like a snake

1649
01:46:29,739 --> 01:46:33,040
and maybe drop people who have

1650
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:36,739
fine too weak spot or whatever when side

1651
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:39,870
okay

1652
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:43,780
now this was other questions about or
other questions of

1653
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:47,940
then go to the mike

1654
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:54,520
do

1655
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:57,720
standard combination lock techniques
apply

1656
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:04,720
to opening these types walks for example
thats

1657
01:47:05,020 --> 01:47:09,690
that is an extremely good question and I
have an extremely good answer

1658
01:47:09,690 --> 01:47:16,690
no as we all know

1659
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:24,630
the everybody who has styled a
combination lock

1660
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:28,020
knows eat rice he rotates three times
right

1661
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:31,670
two times left 1 times right one times
left

1662
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:35,290
and the community and the look is open
yeah that sustain that rotation

1663
01:47:35,290 --> 01:47:39,239
of a combination lock and therefore in
the mocked

1664
01:47:39,239 --> 01:47:43,150
we have tireless the stylus are out a
medic devices

1665
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:46,500
which you can mount on the safe and you
let it

1666
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,390
3-4 days rotate and it dials exactly all
the combinations

1667
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:54,719
with all the possible combinations yeah
and this is way too many plates

1668
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:59,890
locks a.m. all

1669
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:03,560
if we look at two discs of this lock we
see

1670
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:07,000
at the eight holes here

1671
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:12,260
yeah

1672
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:15,800
there are eight holes in these eight
holes you can

1673
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,950
mount the screw and

1674
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:25,160
you can see this crews here the Spruce

1675
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:28,950
have to function of the flight and the
flight

1676
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:32,170
in to in a in the combination lock

1677
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:38,250
it's a fight which takes out on the
taste if I now rotate

1678
01:48:38,250 --> 01:48:41,590
the first disc long enough then the
screw

1679
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:46,250
comes at another screw or another flight
he gets the second disc

1680
01:48:46,250 --> 01:48:50,610
and the 2nd district also rotating now
that's taken they start rotating

1681
01:48:50,610 --> 01:48:56,200
it step by next fly as you can see here

1682
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:59,680
and at a certain moment all the 54 60s a
rotating

1683
01:48:59,680 --> 01:49:02,730
and because you can

1684
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:06,219
very the position of the fly

1685
01:49:06,219 --> 01:49:11,560
because you can't put the fly all 8

1686
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:15,050
different positions you also get
different

1687
01:49:15,050 --> 01:49:18,510
rotation better yet so

1688
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:21,850
the rotation better is not five times
left

1689
01:49:21,850 --> 01:49:25,180
four times let right three times left
two times right

1690
01:49:25,180 --> 01:49:28,989
because of the changing of to fly
positions

1691
01:49:28,989 --> 01:49:33,030
and the it's a very strange

1692
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:37,790
experience with I had to but I doubt it
because you have for example doubt it I

1693
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:40,810
four times to the right and then take a
number

1694
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:44,980
and at four times to the left and I'll
number for

1695
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:48,160
me while it is normally four times to
the right

1696
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,769
and three times and it two times and
then one times yeah

1697
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:55,050
but I it finds everybody to come to the
lockpick village

1698
01:49:55,050 --> 01:49:58,120
and then you can see it yourself yeah

1699
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:03,340
other questions is there a date set when
these will be available for purchase

1700
01:50:03,340 --> 01:50:06,390
can you repeat that duck

1701
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:10,219
available for purchase purchase

1702
01:50:10,219 --> 01:50:13,480
a.m. you can by now

1703
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:17,570
inventor has made hundred of these locks
for test purposes

1704
01:50:17,570 --> 01:50:20,889
et cetera and he also has to cut away
for Shin with

1705
01:50:20,890 --> 01:50:25,050
the manual dialer and I thought 425

1706
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:28,510
dollars you can buy the lock and 450
dollar

1707
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:33,210
you can by Tyler and and yes only made
100

1708
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:36,530
they are all number uniquely and

1709
01:50:36,530 --> 01:50:40,290
a.m. I think they are collectors items

1710
01:50:40,290 --> 01:50:43,550
and they also now be side effect that
they are collector items

1711
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:46,810
they're also nice gadgets and nice

1712
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:50,550
toys for the voice then

1713
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:54,180
so really come to look like phyllis see
the look yourself

1714
01:50:54,180 --> 01:50:59,780
and I think he has brought ten of these
locks with him and that's it

1715
01:50:59,780 --> 01:51:03,200
then a.m. I'd like to point out that

1716
01:51:03,200 --> 01:51:06,480
I'm as with every year for the
conference we

1717
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,870
have made the special pic said design
that specifically designed for these

1718
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:13,380
conferences is the last hope

1719
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:17,140
we decided to make something when you
know when is the last

1720
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:20,210
think that you might have to a.m.

1721
01:51:20,210 --> 01:51:23,760
to to let you into your own house or to
assist other people

1722
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:27,300
it's a credit card sized except a where
you can

1723
01:51:27,300 --> 01:51:31,410
breakaway the parts if you really need
them

1724
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:34,980
I'm going to leave this one intact a and
yeah

1725
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:39,110
that they're also for sale you're on a
conference and

1726
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:43,190
inches it's it's a very nice design
because

1727
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:47,570
the corner of of the the pic said are
also tensioners

1728
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:51,239
so if you break it out there's an
11-piece pick set

1729
01:51:51,239 --> 01:51:55,219
left for you so might be fun to to pick
one up at the

1730
01:51:55,219 --> 01:51:58,340
points okay

1731
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:01,550
then a a.m. when I'm doing sales here

1732
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:05,390
I might as well talk about March book

1733
01:52:05,390 --> 01:52:08,469
a on medico a

1734
01:52:08,469 --> 01:52:11,950
it also covers quite a deal on key
control

1735
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:15,469
a duplicating keys you know

1736
01:52:15,469 --> 01:52:18,950
making making copies of keys at your
that they don't want you to make copies

1737
01:52:18,950 --> 01:52:19,739
of

1738
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:23,450
so might also be good investment

1739
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:26,639
if you're into look i think is it

1740

then rifled through by the TSA

1744
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:58,380
I was a gentleman who put a camera
inside his bag and film with the TSA

1745
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:03,360
did with his back so that's up back damn

1746
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:03,760
