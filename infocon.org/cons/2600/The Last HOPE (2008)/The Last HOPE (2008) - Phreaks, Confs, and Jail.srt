2
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,290
say don't let us out in the midwest that
often but some

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:14,290
this is freak sconce and jail Wow said
there's a lot of more people than I can

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,670
expected to see for such

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,910
Kenneth tough act to follow as sour
Ramban their

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:32,250
I so I have a presentation with me act
as we fight or run laptop but

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,610
I'm gonna start it anyway because I know
that the sites are in my head and you

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,390
can just ended officially follow along
cuz who the hell means power point or

9
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,220
anything like it

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,420
on so we're going to take you back to

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,190
in is something that actually is still
an active and ongoing seen its the cop

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,720
seen

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,739
and that's a Canada critical four-part

14
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,100
what it is to be a freak from a social
perspective at least

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,780
um there's obviously a lot a technical
freak stuff that has spent available

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:06,560
this weekend and I'm sure we've gone
over it but cops are an area that

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,490
really a is hasn't been captured by any
the talks so far and I've never really

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,548
talked about this before cuz I don't
wanna

19
00:01:13,549 --> 00:01:17,729
we even handicaps I'm hoping that that
what happened this time

20
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,229
um so what sick of I'll

21
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,249
let's kinda take you back to the

22
00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:27,810
late 80s and early 90s were you know
what I this got started

23
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,770
said to be clear cops existed before
that freaks would meet on loops to talk

24
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,408
and

25
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,659
so forth but re the you know toward the
and if the 80s like

26
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,840
86 87 88 is when

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,999
the big teleconferencing got started so
at this time

28
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:48,818
there was no big internet series have
choose

29
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,389
um there was sad no

30
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:57,658
real a seen as far as being able to meet
people

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,929
electronically I you actually kinda that
other freaks

32
00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,229
you know and percent at 2600 meetings
and the like so what we had back

33
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,919
I'll late eighties was 2600 magazine

34
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,420
some 2600 meetings put it I some

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,140
up things along the lines up like

36
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,090
you know local I you know Computer Club
said there was pretty active one

37
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,930
that you know you may have heard of
Steve Wozniak was involved with that

38
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,840
down in Silicon Valley and you know he
was one of the earlier freaks

39
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,510
um but there wasn't revealed that the
kind of online community see

40
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,480
had now the closest thing that we had at
the time was PBS's and you probably

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,660
you know sketch how did I think at 37
hour-long documentary on

42
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,109
on the PBS seen that stacey has for sale
this weekend its

43
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,510
said says what

44
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:54,010
your okay okay yep arcade I see me shit
about running Windows

45
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,410
um so there said there was

46
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,240
there were some free PBS's at the time
but you know basically just to capture

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,710
the

48
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,330
the way that you interacted wasn't
things like higher see it wasn't things

49
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:10,530
like message forms that wasn't a lot of
the things that you had now so

50
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,470
you really need to put yourself in that
space to kind of understand what the

51
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,330
scenes about

52
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,540
so I what

53
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,870
what is sick of while a cop is basically
a thing you can dial into

54
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,920
I'll where you can %uh talk to multiple

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,410
other people all at the same time and

56
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,130
and I try to type my password at the
same time

57
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,540
there's you know that there is never a
hope that I've done where things have

58
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,329
fun on time

59
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,380
and this is actually I think the first

60
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:45,450
not the first equipment malfunction I've
had either self

61
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,190
still see um no no no no no

62
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:53,540
so have Parker turn your mic on so let
me introduce somebody who's on the stage

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,260
with me I

64
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,470
who Iran and grab my laptop on

65
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,240
okay hey guys so whoever's running a
beacon and can we want these

66
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,540
Mikes turned on somehow now

67
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,160
are you may have to just come I'm know
yet that worked

68
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,840
now my talk now

69
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,849
ok through talk now to it as my
conflates yeah

70
00:04:19,849 --> 00:04:23,279
yeah sorry to be the at the CAF
operators front

71
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,409
I okay are we to a video

72
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:30,340
now function f for to have it here

73
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:34,629
how many hackers as a take to get it all
look at that

74
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:38,300
we have video you're a

75
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,810
yes its first step yeah okay so we
already covered this slide their side so

76
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,029
how do you mean other hackers

77
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:48,139
PBS's cops all that sort of thing

78
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:54,860
I and so 2600 at the time was more of a
free publication and so

79
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,009
there was like a real big hardware
hacking scene in the late 80s but

80
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,009
there was you know basically as far as
what we did it was more freaking

81
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:07,249
I it and that's what a lot of the
articles if you look at all the issues

82
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,680
if I 2600 magazine covered

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,629
up blue boxes at the time I'm sure
you've all heard a blue box especially

84
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:13,809
if you were at the F

85
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:17,490
history freaking talk this afternoon
this still worked

86
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,520
for the most part and a lot of people
are using

87
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,669
I'm if you don't think it would be the
ass you could I landed at that rate is

88
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:25,479
300 1200 2400

89
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:29,008
yes which is good enough for tax but not
really much

90
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:33,509
in terms of downloads most of them were
long distance just does anybody

91
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,729
raise your hand if you remember like
actually getting a long distance bill

92
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:40,558
over a hundred dollars

93
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:44,340
I don't know got my long distance so I'm
surprised actually that we have that

94
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,349
many people but

95
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:49,020
if you were a PDS Aesop especially you
were to cut your custom to getting a

96
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,169
phone bill at least five hundred dollars
typically any given month

97
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:56,558
I'm so toll charges for real people
wanting to find ways to avoid them

98
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,839
legally or not

99
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,659
was actually I you know a fairly big
deal and I got busted just so you know

100
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,139
it's kinda like

101
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,449
reveal my a chip bet you can do the math
I got busted in seventh grade

102
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,270
for blue boxing and for all that coats
if anybody remembers what on that was

103
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,339
us so class in 1992 still internet
access wasn't where the available there

104
00:06:18,339 --> 00:06:19,999
was a big debate raging

105
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,339
on the internet which was still largely
an academic and government network at

106
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:25,949
the time over whether to let a a while
on

107
00:06:25,949 --> 00:06:29,529
I they probably shouldn't have I

108
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:33,610
PBS's will really in their heyday and I
got in on the game I was running

109
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,279
a the been DDS which had kind of a
secret area for freaking stuff

110
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,339
in at and wheres and the like and it's
kinda funny cuz the dark tension and I

111
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:42,879
will fall

112
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,110
and Seattle and we traded

113
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,289
messages back and forth since we had a
really network and

114
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,808
and a lot of had a lot of the same users
who read it or tension system

115
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:57,669
and 2600 not to be outdone ran EDS but
with a twist it was the 2600

116
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:02,109
Voice PBS and so if you didn't have a
computer you could call into the voice

117
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,189
PBS and you could participate

118
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:08,479
in an online message for am sorta except
you dial that

119
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,248
um blue boxes by the the early nineties
week mostly gone to digital switching

120
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:14,289
and so

121
00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,240
for the most part you could still doubts
of the

122
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,599
c5 networks in some foreign country side
you could

123
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:25,800
about of China direct for example but

124
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,319
it was pretty obvious card like the
techniques that you know people had

125
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,199
learned

126
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,520
likey you note I'll Army recruiting and
and blue box %uh for that

127
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,688
to offer their toll free number largely
didn't work anymore

128
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:40,180
are red boxes Saab still didn't work and
in fact

129
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:44,159
a la Turk also the 2600 Voice PBS most
of them is my gas

130
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,360
were made by Red Box I made more than a
few of them from

131
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,189
the pay phone at the school a block away
from my parents house and

132
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,569
it was considered like you know we have
netiquette now one other pieces at 2600

133
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,409
Voice PBS at a cat which was widely
ignored was

134
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,159
don't low tones into the phone like
making fake quarters while you're

135
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:03,139
leaving a message

136
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,629
on the boys BBS CP listening to a
message somebody saying something and

137
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:08,089
then at United cuttin'

138
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,669
these to posit 25 cents for necks one
minute and you know

139
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,258
somebody deposit if a quarter and then
cops I

140
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:19,860
which we talked about already II began
to gain in popularity

141
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,529
but their work were not a lot of
conferencing systems at Alliance

142
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,080
teleconferencing run by AT&T

143
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,430
was the primary one that people were
using I

144
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,460
and these things were very expensive for
you you know typically you would pay

145
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,130
forty to fifty cents per minute per per
participate so they were kinda aim too

146
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,679
high and businesses

147
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,060
so why if you're a freak would you wanna
cough

148
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,030
well it's a social thing I you could
talk to other people who had similar

149
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,240
interests

150
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,190
I on the phone nobody knows that you're
a 16-year-old pimply faced store can you

151
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,510
know Wisconsin somewhere

152
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:58,780
and very often %uh when you get a whole
bunch Shiv

153
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,020
people with the phone and a big ego and

154
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,740
a lot of boredom together um some
hilarity ensued

155
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,100
so on barcode got into the CAF scene
when he was in high school

156
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,410
and you know what was it like barcode

157
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,740
coming home from high school putting
your backpack down and calling the caf

158
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,630
well I thought you were six feet tall
and black the first time I heard your

159
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,110
voice on the 5th

160
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,300
yeah I am this Sat you know telephone
voice that's kinda intimidating and

161
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,730
big and nobody knows that I am

162
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,730
you know at the time 18 and 210 pounds

163
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,970
and I had the same voice then as I do
now of course I don't

164
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,940
talk like that anymore but at no i think
is right it was a

165
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,310
very much a social thing and I'm in
Sacramento specifically which one

166
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,240
get into later which is why I'm from we
had a pretty active

167
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,370
at hacker community I guess you could
say this is

168
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,060
just around the time is twenty six
hundred million other started in one is

169
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,920
at ninety

170
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,280
green 94 some 2600 no no no no and
Sacramento

171
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,699
on Sacramento yeah I think was I T three
and a

172
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,120
the room reason we probably got into the
comp says because the

173
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,070
a lot of them are based on a sacramento
there is a telephone company out there

174
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,740
that was

175
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,520
somewhat less than responsible with
shred in their trash

176
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,120
if that would be a MCI with that yet min

177
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,160
and under and the profit a red for had a

178
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,890
ultimately somehow up and see an hour he
was gonna hold up some other confident

179
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:33,140
Voser just boys pressures that they'd
set up for this multi-level marketing

180
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,120
companies

181
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,300
and by the time I first call an I don't
remember what the hell was going on the

182
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,240
first time economize conferences but it

183
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,370
certainly wasn't something wrong
wouldn't have kissed him yes so if any

184
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,240
if you think that Amway serves no use
for anything

185
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,730
they were a great source 0 Kos in the
early nineties cuz what they would do is

186
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,160
they set up these teleconferences and
they have all these am way people call

187
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,860
and

188
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,770
and they do you know they're big amway
wire I'm eating like

189
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,150
working to sell stuff in working to show
the plan show the plan show the plan and

190
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,020
we're all gonna be on the time in

191
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,920
yacht and we're just gonna be with rich
device in shape and Andolan selling

192
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,750
amway and then they'd hang up and we'd
call and then start

193
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,960
3 wing McDonalds and asking them to take
their

194
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,390
registers apart but you know anyway I
also found a thought it was interesting

195
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,580
that they would set those comp sup to
use for an hour and they would be up for

196
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,290
six

197
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,920
just yeah yeah this is true well
sometimes he said

198
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,170
you know these guys would I'll like I
will be on the CAF you know doing

199
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,599
something and then

200
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,050
all of a sudden like eight people were
joined and

201
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,490
you know it'd be like hi this is bob
from tulsa oklahoma and I'm here to talk

202
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,590
to you about to

203
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,870
melaluka today and you know like

204
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,460
sometimes has happened at awkward times
like when we were three weighed with

205
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,900
you know like airlines try to get them
to you know give us free tickets or

206
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,880
something

207
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,090
I so yeah I guess that's a waste nicely
in a prank call so

208
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,500
um one of our favorite companies to
prank was

209
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,580
OCI and this was a an alternate operator
service

210
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:14,660
so you know about I before I send and
you know the baby bells and the large

211
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,480
long-distance companies like Sprint and
so forth while

212
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,510
there are a lot of providers that we
call tell us these providers that

213
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,840
basically existed to rip you off when
you made phone calls on your calling

214
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,710
card from pay phones by hoping you

215
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,990
wouldn't notice that it was like some
sleazy provider instead of the real

216
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,900
phone company in

217
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,620
OCI was pretty much at the top of that
game

218
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,290
and the great thing with those CIA is
they had this toll-free back door number

219
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,260
that you could dial into and get an OCI
operator

220
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,540
and they had no idea where you are
calling from there was no way an eye on

221
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,810
this thing so

222
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,220
um you're leaving of one important part
of information which is that OC I had a

223
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,250
very strict policy that their operators
could not hang up on you

224
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:59,690
without manager approval yet yeah that
was the other best part

225
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,980
so it was pretty interesting you know
they could only make collect calls and

226
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,780
the like but

227
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,949
you knowi we call OCI and

228
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,390
asked them all sorts of really unusual
questions

229
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,310
and we try to make collect calls to you
know very unlikely places that they

230
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,870
that we knew they couldn't make calls to
like Libya um

231
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,960
it probably sounds less funny than it
was but

232
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,030
just put yourself in that place your 16
year or so years old you're on the phone

233
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,680
with a bunch of your friends and your
calling somebody that can't hang up on

234
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,620
you no matter how ridiculous

235
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,920
the proposition that you put across the
line as and

236
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,980
you know it really is a lot of fun even
now because they still can't hang up on

237
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,530
you

238
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,780
of yet so I'll 1 800 288 2880 by the way
I

239
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,300
for for a CIA if you if you want to try
your hand with them 200

240
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,410
flee it's there was such a so put
yourself back into cellular phones at

241
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,439
the time they were all crackly analog
and we didn't have

242
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
the nationwide cellular networks that we
do now

243
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,830
so often you travel from one city to
another and your cell phone wouldn't

244
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,610
work

245
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,170
and you get put through to this Sat
thing called cellular express where for

246
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,430
the mir

247
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,780
low low price if I think $3.99 a minute
plus a

248
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,100
five-dollar setup fee and who knows what
else I you could make

249
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,400
you know domestic phone calls on a
crackly analog cellular

250
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,500
outgoing only arm wall that was really
fun because they had a back door

251
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,110
toll-free number two and they also
didn't know where you were calling from

252
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,110
they just thought that you were calling
from some part of the country

253
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,130
York in so I'll

254
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,710
magnate one other freaks that I was on
one other conferences we

255
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,980
called quite a bit decided to become Bob
the

256
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:48,540
operators friend and so he call up um

257
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,130
usually at least 15 times a day and
sometimes more than that

258
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:57,120
and he got to know every single operator
in this Saturday and find out you know

259
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,260
what even with the layout at their
cubicles was because he just call

260
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,319
incessantly

261
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,250
and ask so many questions that they
eventually just started answering

262
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:09,390
everything he asked and then he'd call
and verify with other operators at

263
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,860
different times of the day

264
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,660
and you know if if anybody gave them
false information call until he got the

265
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,500
operator the cave in fake information
and say

266
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:23,280
Welch on you lied to me you told me that
the share next door to you was purple

267
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,579
and I know in fact it's blue

268
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:30,040
on you know why would you like to Bob
the operators friend and you know it it

269
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,829
eventually got to the point that they
knew his voice so well that he'd call up

270
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,470
yeah and they'd say hi POB the operators

271
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,390
Rohit he challenged and I have to say
first of all that this guy was just an

272
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,160
epic prick he was the worst person I've
ever met

273
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,670
here's his his everything that we all
try to convince

274
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,510
everybody we're not where he is actually
a unethical

275
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,819
compare you suggesting I saw a real
truck SIII we're getting to the point of

276
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,980
what why is in federal prison right now
later

277
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,990
but not a joke but she would I would be
in the car with this guy and he'd be on

278
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:07,590
you know random cloned prick found three
of the day and you would cause I would

279
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,010
listen to him do this and he would call
OCI

280
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,650
he would say do you know who this is I'm
by Tegan and sailors were sooo

281
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:18,900
everywhere that I was going and he and
and they would say

282
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,870
Bob the operators friend is a risk of
the operators friend

283
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:26,250
good I'm not gonna bug you anymore
today's summit another operator and I

284
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:26,960
just

285
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,140
anyway it never ended and I'm want I'm
glad the guys in jail

286
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,420
we're getting way every day though the
reason that we're glad he's in jail has

287
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,260
nothing to do with Bobby operators
friend which was really funny by the way

288
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,010
and nobody does stuff like this anymore
I don't think

289
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,710
maybe they do um a while tech support
was an endless source of amusement it

290
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,540
didn't used to be

291
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,660
thank you for calling a 0 air support
this is

292
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,880
gym it may I help you on it was a

293
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,920
I I don't know they with apologies any
Indians in the audience with a thick

294
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,770
accent

295
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,790
you know was faced and in Dulles
Virginia I believe and so you get

296
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,180
somebody who spoke English

297
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,829
and who had been trained to be really
nice to really dumb

298
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:09,250
people on the phone because that's kinda
who else customers were

299
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,689
and you could call up and saying

300
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:16,110
now Opteron the Las saddam

301
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,040
the and her weapon average bang and you
know when I

302
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,180
clicked on the program banked on nothing
but

303
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,920
baby been the lots on my pickup truck
flash

304
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,170
and I think kayo well-liked you know

305
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:36,690
done haywire my wiring on my 68 ap

306
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,330
one ft and you know it

307
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,620
there were at this was some this was one
other tech support call so we put

308
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,740
through like we try to convince a while
that somehow like

309
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:50,450
they were I messing up our pickup truck

310
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:53,559
and they try they would actually

311
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,730
very very very very you'd spend a lotta
time you know trying to convince us that

312
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,740
we shouldn't sue because there's no way
that they could have done that

313
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,750
and you know the these guys which is
take themselves deeper and deeper

314
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,170
um it was pretty funny like they offered
to have the legal department call once

315
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,050
arm Waffle House now that may be seem
fairly unlikely it's like this

316
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,669
chain in the midwest ive waffle
restaurants

317
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,710
and the plae

318
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,660
evidently like one of the ppl a member's
I don't know quite what the story is not

319
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,890
be doing a panel later see you might ask
them but my understanding of this is

320
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,170
at one point somebody from the plae went
to Waffle House and didn't get good

321
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,480
service from one of the waitresses there

322
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,370
and so having gotten the name of this
waitress

323
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:42,380
they just called her incessantly for for
months

324
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,840
and asked for all sorts of questions
like you know

325
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,800
I'll well I won't get into the kinds of
questions they ask good start yeah

326
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,419
yeah I cuz this is being %uh film 10
idoney myself in any trouble

327
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:58,490
but and then the last one and the price
not but definitely not least that

328
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,559
you know came to mind as far as prank
calls was Fred Meyer

329
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,490
now %uh Fred Meyer received you know a
wal-mart is Fred Meyers kinda like a

330
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,660
wal-mart accept that at the time they
sold random things like lumber and

331
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,020
I'm you know auto parts arm but

332
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,050
you could die a lot Fred Meyer and if
you convince them to transfer you to a

333
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:21,510
particular extension then you would be
on the announcements

334
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,870
in store announcement system for the
store and

335
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,220
you could make any announcement you
wanted over the phone

336
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,309
and everybody in the store with he read

337
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,210
all throughout the store and there was
no way that they could make

338
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,880
this stop except by powering down the
phone system which nobody knew how to do

339
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,520
cuz

340
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,379
AT&T ran it and they had to get AT&T out
to

341
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,830
power the system down so you would you
you were guarantee that if you got

342
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,129
transferred to this particular extension
which I won't

343
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,559
say is 909 thousand on here I

344
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,399
then I 0 wat I I didn't say that

345
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,400
%uh it's something other than that I'm
sure arming

346
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,510
yeah they would put you on the in store
system and you know so

347
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,710
it was great to make ludicrous
announcements did you know

348
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:15,700
that if a price if some I am gets
announced over the in store system they

349
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,830
legally have to honor it

350
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:24,830
a so there was an absolute run on
bananas one day like people went bananas

351
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,809
for banana so I'm

352
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,950
they were only nine cents a pound it was
a great deal

353
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,020
I I think they sold completely outta
bananas in the

354
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,260
to wallet and Fred Meyer I'm get I had
nothing to do with that and when they

355
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,200
shut down as extensions a

356
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,000
there may or may not have been some
people that climbed another for the

357
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,260
billion and stalled BBS underneath the
air conditioning unit

358
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,780
all that was it the same way but that's
a different story it

359
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,059
um yeah PBS's by the way K you know
anywhere that you had a computer and a

360
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:56,020
phone line you could set one up and it
didn't necessarily need to be your

361
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,830
computer or your phone line

362
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:02,020
%uh as long as you had a way to power it
and some phone line to plug into you

363
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,670
then it was perfectly possible for BBS

364
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,260
to like say be clipped into like a
credit card verification

365
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:14,960
a line at a Safeway that never received
incoming calls or did it

366
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,280
yeah um so we get into the mid 1990s I

367
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,660
by the way that those that PBS I i heard
might have contains some very illegal

368
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,570
stuff

369
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:30,200
um so in mid 1990s cops are like really
starting to blow up

370
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,070
I they're gaining popularity in business
everybody's using them at this point

371
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,730
and so well anytime something gets big
people old like

372
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:43,480
last start packing those things and so
hacking teleconferences really gain a

373
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,850
lot of popularity

374
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,740
I why it's why stop they started
monitoring conferences periodically

375
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,480
because

376
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,750
at some point some percentage

377
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:56,920
the percentage if legitimate conferences
was eclipsed by the percentage a

378
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,200
fraudulent ones

379
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,530
so they started shutting down hacker
conference is pretty quickly

380
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,750
arm so there would the check propulsion
labs in Pasadena Calif had a bridge that

381
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,000
they only use during business hours and
after business hours it was full of

382
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:11,940
freaks

383
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,520
the there was a phone company called
citizens utilities see and California

384
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,910
that ran a buncha bridges that we were
in. I

385
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,590
there was a company called rebel that's
still around if you got a talkie dot com

386
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,330
Taal Kedi

387
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,370
com that company still around the store
run

388
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,429
I recreational teleconferences but

389
00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,030
the problem remember it long distance
cost money at this time we didn't have

390
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,340
the summer but it's all plans that we
have now

391
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,290
they were almost all long distance so
well there's ways around that

392
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,210
you know you could set up a toll-free
number for instance arm

393
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,270
so of course toll-free numbers if you
set up a toll-free number that means

394
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:53,350
that whoever has the toll free number
pays the bill

395
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:56,790
and we didn't wanna tell so

396
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,720
the best thing to do is to take a toll
free number maybe the belongs to

397
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,900
somebody else and reroute it somewhere

398
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,070
so I a tiny mega elite who was a pretty
active freak at the time I

399
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,540
yeah he's mentally-retarded and I he's
only really good at freaking but he's

400
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,190
very very good at that and social
engineering you still sort of

401
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,910
semi-active in the scene

402
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,559
on activism he literally brute force is

403
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,649
for yeah I mean this guy's gets my hand

404
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,429
if you are at the toll free: panel
earlier where they were demonstrating

405
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:28,500
like you know scanning with Tone Loc

406
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,910
arm make a leech just you know dials by
hand

407
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,720
each number and listens to what happens
there's no no automated techniques for

408
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,500
this guy but he finds a lottery the
interesting stuff

409
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,679
and then he's you know like I said he
say he's mentally retarded so he doesn't

410
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,590
have a job he has literally

411
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:49,169
all day to do nothing but sit on the
phone and talk to anybody who answers

412
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,230
and try to be their friend and he really
does want to be friends with anybody

413
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,200
talks to you

414
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,210
arm so and you know I'm not talking
smack about the guy like I

415
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,670
you know that's just thats that's just
kind of the world he lives in

416
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,610
so he found it phone number that was
part of it

417
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,460
balk account belonging to a paging
company and its fell twenty 150 say

418
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,720
and he likes phone numbers that spell
interesting things and he was kinda

419
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,809
really interested in the occult at the
time

420
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:18,899
so he found that and it went through
this disconnected pagers so he knew that

421
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,510
it was like

422
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,990
0 and I any hundred-number that was up
and then it went to something that was

423
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,070
disconnected

424
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,889
sorry I did a reverse lookup which you
could do you through certain throughout

425
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,020
you know certain a number's called dress
pork numbers that were operated by

426
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,820
various long-distance companies

427
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,169
and found out that a long distance
company called will tell which

428
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:42,610
is the most ghetto long distance company
that ever existed it's a it's now back

429
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,990
in its second incarnation

430
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,890
but they got their start by running
fiber optic cable through disused

431
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,830
gas pipeline in oklahoma it was like
kinda want to those weird idea some

432
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,659
cowboy hat that actually turned into a
phone company

433
00:24:54,660 --> 00:25:00,220
arm and he called up there knock and got
some good ol boy in oklahoma to reroute

434
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,730
that number two

435
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,290
the rap why and the rap line like

436
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,780
if you called it if you did any checking
at all you would never reroute anything

437
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,340
there because it answered

438
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,159
what's up you reached oh crap line
eighty its Rob all

439
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,700
time ok wait till we don't take no
collect

440
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,809
third party or credit card calls you
know and it's like it was basically like

441
00:25:22,809 --> 00:25:26,160
you know this it was the rap line you
know it was there was it was all about

442
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,350
hip-hop and

443
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:32,030
yeah every time you do to agree is this
yeah work on site yet there P

444
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,600
you know no legitimate reason ever toll
free number there ever and it would be

445
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,020
obvious to anyone so

446
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,100
you know this guy just reread it through
didn't check anything

447
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,530
and so this number was up for literally
three months

448
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:47,200
and like you call it and it would be
constantly busy the rap line was

449
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,150
constantly champ full love like a
combination of hip-hop people and freaks

450
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,670
which was kinda strange

451
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:56,120
on the the dynamics got to be a

452
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,390
especially when it came to arguments got
to be a little bit interesting

453
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,670
arm but eventually will tell figure out
what happened and they didn't just shut

454
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:05,630
the number down

455
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,740
they did it one batter they were really
mad so

456
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,400
be routed it shoot this internal I
recording

457
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,670
that was a special disconnect intercept
that somebody some engineer and

458
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,900
the wall tile lock set up intentionally
and it said

459
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,820
welcome to our long distance service if
you're experiencing difficulty

460
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,100
completing your call

461
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,730
please hang up and dial 1 800 I'm a
hacker

462
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:33,559
and we've got your number thank you

463
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,910
I think that she love has a recording at
that around somewhere still

464
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:40,260
but on anyway so

465
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,820
in them in the background like the
cowboy who started will tell was me it

466
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,520
was making a deal with another

467
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,200
cowboy named Bernie Ebbers who was
building a company called worldcom that

468
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,980
then became one of the largest stock
frauds and in the US history but before

469
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,900
that happened

470
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,030
worldcom ended up acquiring will tell
and some

471
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,070
enormous crazy all-stock transaction
website

472
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,649
I know whether the cowboy got out in
time before that happened or what

473
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,210
Tory care but the end result was the
will tell engineers

474
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:12,120
left in the world com engineers came and
then one day the world com

475
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,160
some worldcom switch engineer found this

476
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,440
and thinking that obviously it must have
been some some

477
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,510
active sub your subterfuge your
sabotaged by the outgoing will tell

478
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,690
staff knew they were losing their jobs

479
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,510
he did the only logical thing which was
to route the number back to the rap line

480
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,450
which of course was where it should
offend

481
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,540
so it was up for another two months
before you actually worldcom figured out

482
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,418
that no

483
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:39,919
having a toll free number the rap lane
is in what they should be doing and

484
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,130
that one away arm so

485
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:47,270
01 Tripoli magnate magnet the guy we
talked about earlier

486
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,830
and he really wanted a number that
spelled his name so soon as the ATT a

487
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,629
prefix became available he set up a
subscription fried with MCI

488
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:59,440
now unfortunately for magnate MCI was
really wise to this kinda thing so

489
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,500
although he managed to get the setup
slip by them

490
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,380
they had a verification team that would
go through into quality assurance later

491
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,460
and so week later got shut down

492
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,080
on and then I somebody who's not me

493
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,309
I

494
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,860
attached a

495
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,920
a toll free number spelling 100 g/l bond

496
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,490
arm to a different bridge and

497
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,460
so basically like identity theft
everybody knows what that is now

498
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,280
but back then like the idea of stealing
the identity of a company and signing up

499
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,370
for service on the existing account
which is really easy to do

500
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,800
like you know you have an existing
account that belongs to some company and

501
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,540
you just want to add additional services

502
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,180
all companies always wanna so you more
stops so it was really easy to do that's

503
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,990
and if it was a big company could be a
while before they noticed and I

504
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:50,360
and shut down shut it down and this one
lasted for six months at least

505
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,470
on so in the meantime

506
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:57,800
I I was living in or you can and had
some friends wanna firm's name

507
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,840
the felon and he was a felon then

508
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,920
and he's much more of a felon now and so

509
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,890
we'd go out and we'd actually call each
other and say hey let's go out and

510
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,250
commit felonies tonight it was very
casual

511
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:16,190
arm so yeah it to unfortunately the
statue limitations i think is passed for

512
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,380
most of that stuff but

513
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,740
I do what you gotta do you think I think
I while you know they're

514
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,240
we we live in an your tires retroactive
laws were like you break the law of your

515
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,670
corporation and then we're at
retroactively pass a law like granting

516
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,780
immunity and then

517
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,710
you know that Patriot Act in
retroactively extended the statute of

518
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,660
limitations for a lot of stuff so I
think it's just a matter of whether

519
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,860
that police want to arrest you now on
but a guy named

520
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,860
well I'm not gonna say his name here cuz
there's people that might want it but a

521
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,680
secret service agent showed up at the
2600 meeting in Portland which I started

522
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,180
by the way

523
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,630
arm and was looking for the profit and
around that time I thought it was a good

524
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:55,630
idea to get outta town so where do you
go when you're from

525
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,180
Oregon and you need to get outta town a
small town in arkansas it's a good place

526
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,050
to live low

527
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,510
I was right down the road from poker
hollow

528
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,780
in a place called toad sack which is
down the road from pickles Capen yes

529
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,930
these are all places

530
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,000
i've i've been there they're actually
agree of yeah

531
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,510
yeah bar-coded K actually came in
unrelated a reason

532
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,410
tote sack arm so yeah anywhere

533
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:24,860
at that point I there was a lot of stuff
going on and so we did

534
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,700
I am there was a lot of cloning that was
happening with cellular phones

535
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,740
arm one thing that was a popular device
was called the TDI

536
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,200
and so just a quick crash course on

537
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,060
a analog cell phones there was no
security anything that you sent through

538
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,530
the air like your yes and your men para
like

539
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:48,200
everything having to do with your phone
just got second Phoebe Anna Claire

540
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,280
and so the obvious solution

541
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,840
that congress came up with for this
rather than mandating digital technology

542
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,080
that would have been more secure is they
made it illegal to listen to certain

543
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,449
radio frequencies and I'm sure that we

544
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:05,310
all in this room would never do anything
the government doesn't want in that area

545
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:10,100
arm so if you had a Radio Shack scanner
that wasn't even modified it was just a

546
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,260
little older than

547
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:14,710
the current year and you had a computer
with that piece of software loaded on it

548
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,330
you could just are for yes and N percent
on the day and

549
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,480
yes and in Paris like basically all the
information you need to clone somebody's

550
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:20,929
phone

551
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:26,420
um you sir for this are the air all day
long and so that kinda happened up

552
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,610
we were in Las Vegas and I remember

553
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,679
sitting in a hotel room with you know
this guy and a couple other people from

554
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:34,320
oregon

555
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,379
I at Def Con too I think and

556
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:43,070
you know we're just I have never seen
yes and in pairs

557
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:47,040
come across a computer screen as quickly
as on the Strip in Las Vegas it was just

558
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,928
pam pam pam pam pam pam am

559
00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:53,100
it was not specify where were you gonna
go add to clone cell phones except where

560
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,620
people are making a lot of phone calls

561
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,840
arm wanna be a carrier's there

562
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,190
who is the carrier that had to recall
announcements you remember that was in a

563
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,920
Las Vegas

564
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,510
on but eventually they got acquired by
sprint but to

565
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,510
they they had some really awesome
announcements when you call that it was

566
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,100
it a good candidate to

567
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,140
and then your call cannot be completed
as dialed please check the number and

568
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,960
try again

569
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,640
this is a message from cellular carrier
Las Vegas with there were okay 906 you

570
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,160
want to clone a phone

571
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,550
and that was so the most preferred model
since you could

572
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,740
ticket ship out replace it with a
different one that had been programmed

573
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,980
with software that would allow you to
very easily input

574
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:35,800
yes and in pairs the you start with addi
aircraft from other sources and their

575
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,740
code lines

576
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,610
where people post yes and in Paris PBS's
that will follow these things

577
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,220
arm and a Motorola break was another
popular

578
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:47,010
phone because it was a lot cheaper you
could pick him up and pawn shops for

579
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,570
like 10 bucks at the time

580
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,830
and all you had to do with sas/sata RAID
to a parallel port

581
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,950
you could program through your computer
and so you know me being broke

582
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:00,050
that's what I used on at the time there
were manual billing arrangements you

583
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,120
didn't have this electronic billing that
you have now so

584
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,560
you could go like trashing for yes and
in Paris like

585
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,360
at a cellular store somewhere and say
mississippi down the road from Booker

586
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,410
hollow

587
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:17,000
and then it you could take those pairs
up chu sayin like you know Seattle

588
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,929
and you could use them for a good month
and then when the bill for a billion

589
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:20,980
dollars like

590
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,400
got mailed on paper on like seven
hundred pages to the cellular carrier in

591
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,070
mississippi

592
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,090
only then with your yes and then pair
get

593
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:32,870
killed so you know having a pair that
would last for a long time was kind of a

594
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,900
big deal

595
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,480
arm so there were a and B sides on
sailors you would have some a site

596
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,390
carriers that interoperate it's sorta

597
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,280
than they could you follow me roaming
and there were peace i carriers that use

598
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,490
a different system

599
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:47,669
I be site used a system called mobile
link

600
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:52,060
and the ace in general and then the
a-side use a system called the NEC and

601
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,710
on you know now you just flood get on a
plane land fire up your phone it works

602
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,550
and you don't have any the second
generations but

603
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,639
some a side carriers operated service on
both the A&B side and US west cellular

604
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,630
was one at these they operate in a site
system in Omaha

605
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,179
in a b-side system nearly everywhere
else so if you took

606
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,540
a carrier's I yes and men para and you
operated on the opposite system love

607
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,179
them

608
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:20,609
that was even better because you can
receive incoming calls in your market

609
00:34:20,609 --> 00:34:23,730
and you would never ring the other guy's
phone so you could

610
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,840
and you know another the system's other
tell was followed me

611
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,980
roaming linked up so it was kinda fine
like I you know sailor freaking was a

612
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:35,300
Wis gave I'll a lot of opportunities for
a interesting stuff

613
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,570
arm the felon one of our friends side
who is still active on tell a friend

614
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,480
I cloned I think hafer from a high I he
was

615
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,850
kinda in business for himself sort of

616
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,759
and got a little busted for that and
then what are the best prank calls that

617
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,899
we made with soya

618
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,949
you know be string called and I it took
off

619
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:59,299
and I'll we made a call to the white
house

620
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,920
and needed a urgently speak to the
secret service to find out

621
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,440
on you know whether or not the president
used amway products

622
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,090
you know this was this was you know
after one of those amway conferences

623
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,250
this was something that we really really
need it now so

624
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,650
arm they asked for a lot of information
personal about ourselves and I'm sure

625
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,470
whatever we told the most accurate and
then told us that it was not ever

626
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,420
business whether the president used
amway products so I think president

627
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,330
clinton

628
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,700
definitely used amway products I and

629
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,210
immediately after that I've never seen
any s and men pair killed so quickly

630
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,580
like

631
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,630
you know 10 minutes later peace train
call back into the CAF any psych

632
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:42,070
then 4q man but he is seven pair got all
them got all toasty matter what the hell

633
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,870
you do whatever we call that number man

634
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:48,210
it was pretty fun %uh so

635
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:53,240
I then kinda things came crashing down
and some of us started going to jail

636
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,020
I and this guy is why the ones you like
cop busted

637
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,140
I barcode maghame doctor havoc on %uh
passed in the same week

638
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,509
I so like the other thing that kinda
keep in mind is that the feds are a lot

639
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,060
more clued now than they used to be

640
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,980
like some phone shenanigans their
typically Wellington not

641
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,290
really get involved with if it doesn't
really have anything to do with

642
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,150
terrorism

643
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:18,240
like you know stealing money or anything
along those lines arm

644
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,630
back then if you were hacker you were as
good as a terrorist as far as these guys

645
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,620
were concerned they had not been trained

646
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,640
they didn't really realize second you
know crimes with computers for the same

647
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,339
as crimes with other crimes and they
didn't

648
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,870
for crimes with other mediums and they
didn't really understand like what

649
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,029
computer crime wise

650
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,900
so you're dealing with a very very
aggressive law enforcement

651
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,060
I atmosphere and the other thing that
was kinda fun was there was a lot of

652
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,180
infighting like the FBI and the Secret
Service couldn't make up their mind who

653
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,890
was

654
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,490
responsible for what and so sometimes
you had people getting busted by

655
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:53,910
both law enforcement agencies on
successive days for the same things and

656
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,549
that

657
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:58,240
resulted in a lotta cases like not
coming off very well

658
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,370
so the fed's to their credit have much
more of a clue now than they use to see

659
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,770
you really have to take yourself back to
that time

660
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,620
um but by code now he probably %uh to
talk about his past year I had a jump in

661
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,850
here I got it I gotta take five minutes
from here

662
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,089
so summit to work on Seattle

663
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,720
2008 and the profits about to go up and
give the stock

664
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,859
and he says I'm gonna happen to give the
stalkers and that's great was about

665
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:25,259
as I was about that thing where mom
about the shower gunpoint

666
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,440
0 that's that's cool

667
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,670
so a but it did get me thinking that I'm

668
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,170
trying to deal delineated hacker
generations

669
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,170
you can come up a lot always adore you
can say oh the you know one generation a

670
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,470
Packers existed before

671
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,160
you know your mom had an email address
and that after that it's a next

672
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,910
generation are

673
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:47,020
before you know pick pick any type of
major topic before you know

674
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,200
they're charging for domains but I think
that

675
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,920
a really good way to delineate
generations akers

676
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,930
is the point at which the fed's stop
being the bad guy

677
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,940
or we stop being the bad guy to the
Fed's and that

678
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,970
was relatively recently am obviously
there's still

679
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:07,120
many exceptions to this rule but there
was a point

680
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,609
not long ago where who is we know but us
in Sacramento on this is a story in

681
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,990
specific in its own and Brees is very
quickly

682
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,550
but in Sacramento in the 2600 mean
started

683
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,870
we had an incredibly adversarial
relationship with with the cops

684
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:21,790
basically

685
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:25,440
that choices are meaningless Sacramento
County hi-tech Crime Squad

686
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,930
newly-established had something group
for now there's a good reason they're

687
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,180
established to be fair

688
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,390
so internet segment was extended with
relatively sizable

689
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:36,640
and everybody there was up to some sort
of shady BS in many ways to be perfectly

690
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,299
honest it was

691
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:40,609
these are very shady people including
myself to a certain extent

692
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,859
but one particular thing happened and
inside you know about this is something

693
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:45,830
you want but there is a

694
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,630
gentleman named Josh Cohen his nickname
was pactel

695
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,910
rest in peace and she

696
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,140
stole something in the seven figures
love

697
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,640
hardware from Hewlett Packard and sold
it to

698
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,799
the mop and he was it part in the 2600
chris is this

699
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,960
did not bode well for us as soon as this
occurred we became public enemy number

700
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,589
one

701
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,080
and the form this high-tech crime task
force and they were

702
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,509
actively surveilling is this isn't like
my was paranoid things like they

703
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,520
actually had people

704
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,560
with for like what like telephoto lenses
on the other side item of my choice $600

705
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,190
million and we would walk right up to me
like 20 2007

706
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,500
yes so the spot the Fed contested Afcon
yeah like

707
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,740
isn't a joke well it started out being
real well and sand to be fair the San

708
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:33,920
Francisco ties Xmen also had people
surrounding us just as they were jerks

709
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,600
like that and they decide to come get us
which was actually pretty funny

710
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,819
to be fair so I what spot the Fed who's
a fad

711
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:42,950
richer and Anya nice a

712
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,220
but it still won't tell you wanna they
one of the side effects

713
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,730
if this was that beam you know young and
green

714
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,270
arrogant at week it was kind of an
ongoing court where

715
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,540
where we would do things to aggravate
them there are two things aggravate that

716
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:01,460
aggravate us and they even would send
undercover officers to the median

717
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:04,520
but we were you know we would invite
them back to the afterparty

718
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,250
run their plates find out third cops and
walk right up to me I can I'm

719
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:12,680
your cop and they're done I'm not
milliliters

720
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,040
this says yar and

721
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,779
and then like that very much never been
like three times and some point you

722
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,740
figure like God you know use someone
else's car

723
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,510
nice based in like three times like that
in the same six-month period so

724
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,480
K and and the the thing that really made
things worse was that once I'm there is

725
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,810
a particular hacker that

726
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,410
as have a retaliatory think he pulled
the blueprints

727
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,660
love the lead detectives home and

728
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,399
xeroxed you can still do their public
record for now yes xeroxed them

729
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,760
and brought in the 2600 his hand them
out and of course there's a cop there

730
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,190
and that got back very quickly and

731
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,470
and this happened in a very strange time
for an organ a rapidly fast-forward

732
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:56,730
through a crazy sequence of events

733
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,830
a couple friends of ours got busted for
some pretty strange tax

734
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,180
one thing that happened was a friend of
ours accidentally and it's actually

735
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,850
the truth heap heap was trying to break
into a system now is international

736
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:07,509
needed

737
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,670
but he didn't know is that the system
was actually some sort of control system

738
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,850
for it damn

739
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,640
yeah I was a SCADA system like
controlling the Columbia River Oaks so

740
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,279
so the secret service or if you are
somebody got called and he got busted

741
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,310
for this and this

742
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:23,250
I'm really in it too like it was the
RCMP that one after yaa and so you got

743
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:23,730
busted

744
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,520
she kind of gives information ever not
really is actually really call Diane you

745
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:27,920
tried

746
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,400
you know can't protect everybody but
that led to the CAF

747
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,180
because he was coming into the car so
Wiese the comp started getting monitored

748
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,569
by some sort of law enforcement agency
in one by one they start picking a soft

749
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,920
and we knew this was happening and

750
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:43,620
it started with a guy named magnate
which we who brought up earlier

751
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,759
magnate is just the worst person ever
and he really want to get caught like

752
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,080
everything he was doing

753
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,569
thank you sis down he really was the
worst person ever he really wanted to

754
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,109
get caught

755
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:56,210
he did really i mean this guy was like
on a clone phone and a

756
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,160
stolen Buick driving over Middle Road
cons throwing up like a

757
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,600
fishtail sparks my name on the freeway
with both fingers up at the window I'm

758
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,490
here's little

759
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,790
this is not a fake story it was between
Sacramento and low to high

760
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:12,109
he actually did this a and then just
play it claimed anger ignorance I was

761
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:14,940
having a seizure or something and he's
got away with it

762
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,030
great-great-great the SRS so health
sheer

763
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:22,160
he you he gets busted

764
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:25,710
surprisingly enough while he's driving
around is literally on the car fuse I'm

765
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,850
going to Taco Bell to try to pull some
sort of scam and he drops

766
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:32,500
and we get really suspicious because
some other people recently dropped

767
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,020
and we call his employer the next day
find out he had shown up for work

768
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,420
callers he was still in school college
school found out he hadn't shown up

769
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,580
and at that point we knew we were
completely screwed and that was it

770
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:45,980
and sure enough magnet gave all of us
out hit by name

771
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,120
give up my home address in totally don't
all have our docs and we knew this was

772
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,890
happening this is

773
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,960
three days for Def Con for so I've never
met the profit in person at this point

774
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:56,839
we are going to

775
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,970
I don't know about these guys but I went
into complete fucking panic mode I'm not

776
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:01,560
gonna lie I was absolutely terrified

777
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,630
it was really scary to think like these
guys I've been doing wrong things are

778
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:05,859
clearly wrong

779
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:09,170
I wasn't stemming from people I was
going credit card fraud I was actually

780
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,880
on the scale of things kinda okay but I
had done some things

781
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,850
and these guys were coming to get me and
they knew where I lived my brother

782
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:17,319
called me and said there's like

783
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,859
old men taking photos of our house from
a from afford

784
00:43:20,859 --> 00:43:25,109
and I said well yeah stiff so we are
going to Def Con for

785
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:28,920
completely paranoid getting have a
rental van driver the middle of the

786
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:29,640
desert

787
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:33,279
and essentially have this Frank
conversations am i okay what we all need

788
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,160
to know cuz we've

789
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,790
we've been incredibly vague over the
phone for the past couple weeks in

790
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,870
paranoid can get our story straight

791
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,440
go back home I get back to Sacramento
and a week later

792
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,970
they literally came through the windows
and I'm at my parents house I wasn't

793
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:46,520
there I was

794
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:50,530
on my way to a twenty six hundred
million hands

795
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,589
and they knew what they were doing
damage is gone there they pulled my mom

796
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,320
outta the shower they do the opposite
totally over the top

797
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,890
and this is this this is so funny I a
Cayman believe it actually happened my

798
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:00,680
brother

799
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,410
is sitting on the computer in the house
and his plane

800
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:07,500
Police Quest crap

803
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,210
possible but it looks like and they

804
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,820

810
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,580
brother at the keyboard

811
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:41,830
I'm thinking mass Falconbridge you could

812
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:45,690
from a Mac delete everything fuck and

813
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:48,839
I could I couldn't believe it said they
gonna my room and in my room of course

814
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:50,140
they found my

815
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,540
case or ban with I do you cables hang in
there because the week before I threw my

816
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,320
heart racing

817
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,170
god damn Lake knows I thought they were
coming so it's you I throw everything

818
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:57,810
out

819
00:44:57,810 --> 00:45:01,370
and hang out they did get some stuff I
mean eventually was prosecuted but what

820
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,930
we'd agreed to before this

821
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:06,029
very apparent is that we're we had a
phone tree

822
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,250
in Sacramento we doubt we'd all agree
that if somebody got busted we call the

823
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:12,920
host seriously like i neva slippin movie
was that I will call the next guy

824
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,290
you say stupid phrase and on now and the
phrase I swear to god never said this in

825
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,299
public and I can't have much to say on
stage

826
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,790
the phrase which which we thought was
totally brilliant was how are your

827
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,440
mother's

828
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,359
flowers yeah totally inconspicuous if
you call someone say that right

829
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,490
so I sci-fi I actually did in this is is
it

830
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:37,170
to be fair it worked I called my my body
pegasus is in the CNS I saw him and I

831
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,630

832
00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:43,589
no thanks I said yeah man har har
mothers flowers and he just goes

833
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:46,880
silent because we've never talked about
it and she goes

834
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,530
the right man here gotta go and and to
be tera

835
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,920
to to be to be terribly serious that
actually work today it was the end of

836
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,310
the PBS seen in Sacramento

837
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,460
that day which have to obviously you
next and that he called all the other it

838
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:01,799
was a

839
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:04,660
very devious heavy at the time he called
all the other pvs operators and

840
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:05,629
everybody call everybody

841
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,839
and like 15 major major for

842
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,690
Northern California like no hacker PBS's
went down a day and never came back up

843
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,160
and those guys but their computers in
their car and left

844
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,810
and and and so I brought a cassette tape
thingy to my

845
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,950
interrogations which I was interrogated
a pizza parlor without a lawyer present

846
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,069
to a shower and sleep I responded
everything with I plead the fifth i'm

847
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:27,870
talking you

848
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,170
for Expo above are I tape-record
everything because I wanted everybody to

849
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,940
know that I wasn't gonna rat them out

850
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,339
and I didn't I didn't say anything and
the Sacramento bus

851
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:40,390
stop to me but before this had happened
they basically at

852
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,509
over the past several years busted
pretty much

853
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:47,480
all of us for something and so we had
this the sacraments $1,600 group which

854
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,390
with all these people in it and get back
Pepe con got busted for the tower

855
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:53,160
records thing I went down for a year and
Josh was in federal prison

856
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,580
everybody was everybody was gonna bust a
magnet was gone

857
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,609
missionary care about and and we all
thought you know

858
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,720
this is can't this can't go on like this
bit it was gives a characteristic over

859
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,630
something that doesn't exist anymore

860
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,770
they look at us as the bad guys and we
look at them as the bad guys so to speak

861
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,160
we were had an adversarial

862
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,520
relationship and that is a generation a
Packers that

863
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,630
that existed in that time frame that

864
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,650
if you if you if you came into the scene
and I'm not trying to say this in a

865
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:22,480
negative way

866
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,000
but for people that enter the scene and
at that time

867
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,170
the relationship with the government
with the feds are the cops sp wasn't

868
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:29,600
this

869
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:33,250
in this adversarial manner you there is
a segment

870
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,520
there's a way that we thought back then
it just doesn't exist anymore and it's

871
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,330
it is very positive now I'm very happy
that things are like they are

872
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:43,540
but if you weren't there for that it's
really difficult to understand what that

873
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,680
was like because what you're talking
about judges who didn't understand what

874
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,649
you know was

875
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,660
your parents in an email address you can
nobody understood when you went to court

876
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,440
when I went to court and I've got a
Chino

877
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,580
I'm trying to explain the stuff to a
coworkers it they were the courts be

878
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,180
honest was very cool with me try to
limit on my own story

879
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,640
it's kinda like wall so what did you do
yeah and they they were asking us is

880
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:05,049
opposed to the prosecution sometimes
like

881
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:08,359
what went on did the district attorney
and walking orders to get me on three

882
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:09,540
felonies and misdemeanor

883
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,100
I was suppose to be in jail so I was 18
and no computers to I was 21 or

884
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,770
something like that I walked I was

885
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:18,180
fucking terrified about this literally
absolutely terrified

886
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,910
shaking in my shoes completely scared
and by the time I got in there I started

887
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:24,330
a cow walk them off through what was
really going on

888
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,549
I swear to God before a workout room
first of all I got off with one

889
00:48:27,549 --> 00:48:29,569
misdemeanor 50 hours community service

890
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:32,759
true and

891
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:36,330
but but

892
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,819
which the district attorney was slightly
less than pleased about

893

905
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:19,180
and but yet as a

906
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,440
if asked for a couple years you know one
thing I don't want to clarify about what

907
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,690
that with the proper was saying is that
there's a couple things that you never

908
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,319
do

909
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,420
ever ever ever ever ever you never ever
ever screw with emergency services

910
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,160
doing brand called ever never sworn I
want never Smith was controlled never do

911
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,290
anything

912
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:39,720
and and actually that segways 39 yeah
and

913
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,480
that it is a present-day that segways
right into magnate and I wanted to let

914
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,880
this point because he's the one that
knocked me out so this is a guy that

915
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,930
basically in archives and marching out
walking a third-rate

916
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:52,529
so this is a guy that that are added you
how to the cops and and he

917
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,490
you might have seen on CNN a couple
months ago a that there is some people

918
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,170
busted

919
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,620
it is a front-page stuff for slot in
where you do is avoid

920
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:04,990
use VoIP you do this a nice move and you
get SWAT call to come somebody's house

921
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:08,660
that guy on the front page CNN Jason
Trowbridge

922
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:13,000
magnate to get Sam Gagner Cassady gotta
about 3-4 weeks ago he just got

923
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,260
sentenced to 16 months in

924
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:19,180
in a federal prison yeah

925
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,890
so this is our last slide 9 being a
being asked to wrap up very quickly but

926
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,109
fast forward to today cops their dime a
dozen long distances affectively free

927
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,730
and we still use them

928
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:33,010
um because it's still a social thing

929
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:37,510
up a lot of weight freaks hang out on
the tele freaked out or Kopf and

930
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,930
you know if any of you are interested in
enough weight

931
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:44,060
that's a great place to get information
it can hang out with us

932
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:47,990
I but there's a dark side white and that
is that

933
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,940
it's a very new technology there's it's
very easy to gain access to ss7 and do

934
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,980
all sorts are really nasty shenanigans
like swatting

935
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,190
and I do I love you know it's wanting us

936
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:04,400
yes now okay wall the I'll give you a
really quote quick nutshell us wanting

937
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,380
effectively when you call 911 your anime
which is your phone number gets

938
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:12,580
transmitted to the PSAP and I wrote a
very very detailed article about this I

939
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:13,279
think

940
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,040
two issues ago at 2600 I write telecom
and former college by the way

941
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,609
I'm so go pick up the issue if you're
interested in this but

942
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:24,630
affectively if you call op I am and
you're using a certain way

943
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:29,040
certain set up VoIP services you can
scoop somebody say and I

944
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,230
and make a 911 PSAP think that sums
hostage situation is going down cya at

945
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:35,330
somebody's house

946
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:38,890
and they'll respond with you know arms
cops in a helicopter and other things

947
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:41,670
that you would hope that the police
would do if somebody were holding you

948
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:44,170
hostage in your home and they were armed
in crazy

949
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,150
on and you know people very easily if
you pull this kinda sad

950
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:53,109
could could be told in you know E they
be entirely innocent so magnate

951
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,150
the guys 29 years old and he still doing

952
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:59,580
shed and up so he got in in with the
couple love

953
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,620
you know younger hacker younger freaks
rather

954
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:05,980
they started pulling these kinda starts
and I you know that something the you

955
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,799
deserve to go to jail for like five
years isn't absolutely

956
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:14,270
alright I think we're done and next up
there's a yes social engineering

957
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,580
panel of some kind which I think we'll
see a lot of finite that we gotta

manual and men that can on it so last
8-10 thanks

959
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:33,410
just a

960
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:38,759
just a quick reminder we don't have any
paid people that pick up after everybody

961
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,099

962
