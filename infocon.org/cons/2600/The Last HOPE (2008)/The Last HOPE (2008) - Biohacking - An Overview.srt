1
00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:05,090
%uh the reason I decided to give the
stalkers because the last hole

2
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,790
conference

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,129
I was in a bar with some guys after a

4
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,680
a long day of talks and we were talking
about the way information is encoded

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,130
in various ways in various systems and
at the time I was working on a DNA

6
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:19,509
project trying to figure out how

7
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,259
information is encoded in DNA and I
thought it would be really interested in

8
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:24,970
this idea so we started talking about it

9
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:28,869
and there was clearly love interest in
it but all throughout the conversation

10
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:30,720
they kept coming back to this we'll

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,019
what's what's the name and I'm I so had
to realize

12
00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:38,469
that I was talking to people who you
know its

13
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,629
spent a live setting up honey pots and
filtering packets and stuff and maybe

14
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,089
they never took a biology course

15
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:48,859
I'm so but the second reason I decided
to stalk is because I see a lot of

16
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,190
similarities between molecular biologist
do

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,960
in trying to figure out systems that are
difficult to understand on and what

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,820
other people do trying to explore
systems

19
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,460
and I think that there's a sort of
growing interest in molecular biology

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,410
and I think you can see that just in
this miss next slide

21
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,690
there's a cover over recent issue Make
Magazine in which

22
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,030
this article talking about how to
precipitate DNA in your kitchen

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,960
and this article describes how to
isolate DNA

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,370
how to run a gel to characterize DNA how
to build the thermal cycler to use PCR

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,510
to amplify DNA

26
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:26,730
and what you see in the picture here is
on a class in death on the bottom and

27
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,090
some salt water on the top

28
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,520
and DNA is really soluble in salt water
but it's not recycling ethanol

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,170
serenity interface there's a
precipitation going on in UC's little

30
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,990
tiny strands of DNA precipitating out a
solution um

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,270
crisp so this leads to the question what
is what is by attacking

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,960
I think in general it's two things for
me and one of them was

33
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,260
you know you know owner Stephen levy a
spoke this afternoon

34
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,740
%uh he talked about done you know a

35
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,190
some the characters in the book in the
following way: the grown up with the

36
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,780
specific relationship to the world

37
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,030
wearing things had meaning only if you
found out how they worked

38
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,230
and how would you go about that not
getting your hands on them

39
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,130
%uh now with biological systems I i tend
to think they have meaning even if I

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,620
don't really understand how they work

41
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:17,010
but if you consider that when you walk
down the street have really funny b-tree

42
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,890
is is executing operations that's been
going on since longer than humans

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,060
existed on the planet

44
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,660
and we don't even understand was that
those things I think it's fascinating

45
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,350
and I think it's

46
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,609
it's also on fascinate me to try to
understand what does mechanisms are

47
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,250
and there are methods for getting your
hands on the inside living cells

48
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,480
I'm in the second the second aspect love
I guess by attacking would be

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,149
I'm given a little bit information

50
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,780
and given if a little bit knowledge is
there anything that I can do that's

51
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,310
novel

52
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,380
a.m. I should say on the last slide

53
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,650
I'm wanna main point I want to make your
was that

54
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,510
there was a time when the only people
isolating DNA were PHD's and researchers

55
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,910
and now you you know high school
students are doing it on and I think

56
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,230
these

57
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,100
these two groups of people are still
isolating DNA but they're doing it for

58
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,060
two different reasons

59
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,610
on researchers are trying to find out
more and more information about systems

60
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,040
which they already know a lot about

61
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,040
whereas a high school student might say
look there's a lot of stuff I don't have

62
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,459
to know to do something useful

63
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,420
and that's a former abstraction an
abstraction is one with engineers get

64
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,090
things done

65
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,870
and this will come up later a

66
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,110
so these two different aspects once a
top down approach trying to probably box

67
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,069
and see what happens

68
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,319
and the other one the other one is if I
have a few components

69
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,510
what can I do with this you know I know
with this protein is used for but is

70
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:39,290
there anything else I can do with this
protein

71
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,929
I'm be some we can ask are

72
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,569
or biological system tackle I think they
are

73
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,980
consider this this picture here where if
you make a small change to the

74
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,580
information content to the system

75
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,599
suddenly it has a very drastic effect so
this is a a

76
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,980
a disease called bracket activism and

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,180
a small change to the information
content to DNA cause the second bone in

78
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,150
your index finger

79
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,770
to change length so does that mean that
there's a gene which controls the twenty

80
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,150
every bone in your body

81
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,560
on is this information used anywhere
else in your body

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,749
in other words if you saw someone with
the short index finger would you expect

83
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:19,620
their toes

84
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,360
their I guess thermometer also to be
extra short on it turns out the people

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,930
with this

86
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,039
I'm this summer disease do have
shortened

87
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:32,188
toes but you might ask why does not
affect the the length

88
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:36,180
everyone you know the second Boehner all
your fingers it's very similar bone

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,029
on but it just doesn't another example
this is shown here where

90
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:45,439
a small change the information contact
the system causes an entire program to

91
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,490
misfire

92
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,590
so on the left hand side I mean on the
left hand side of the slide

93
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,680
is a as a regular fly head and there's
these two those structures

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,960
right here called antenna on but on the
on the right hand side

95
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,808
up those in 10 have been replaced by
legs so these two pictures

96
00:05:02,809 --> 00:05:06,809
are our pictures the flies with legs
going over their head in 7-10 a

97
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:10,449
on and it takes a development program to
grow a leg it's not just one

98
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,080
you know they will change so yet it's
only one change in the DNA that causes

99
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,039
this whole program to misfire

100
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,498
so I think these are both ways in which
you can see that

101
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,990
the information content living systems
executes very much like programs do

102
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,169
and things can go wrong and things to be
altered

103
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,039
I'm both these changes I just showed
were things which were found in nature

104
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,128
nobody knows enough about biology to go
around giving people short fingers or or

105
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:36,569
make

106
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,120
you know flies collects other face on

107
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,189
but that's not to say that that's not
changing there's a

108
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:46,439
programs trying to figure out you know
like the salamanders to come off on

109
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,219
their limbs

110
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:51,339
the limb grows back on in zebrafish if
you cut up some other organs the organs

111
00:05:51,339 --> 00:05:52,779
regenerate themselves

112
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,050
I'm so these mechanisms exist and there
are there are

113
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,219
research programs going on to try to
figure out how do we

114
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:02,270
you know understand all this stuff

115
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,889
%uh so in this talk I'm gonna I'm
basically gonna talk a little bit about

116
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:06,110
DNA

117
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,339
I'm I'm gonna give a little bit about
historical perspective to try to

118
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:13,749
set the stage for white why is thinking
about hacking modules relevant now

119
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,439
I'm what's changed in the past few years
to make this such a pressing question

120
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,479
now

121
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:20,360
and I'm gonna talk a little bit in
detail but to biological circuits

122
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,589
justice or to get a sense for

123
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:27,159
for what kind of things people do and
and maybe what they can do

124
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:31,960
I'm so first of all a.m. delays the
molecules and all your cells

125
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,119
on every living system is composed

126
00:06:35,119 --> 00:06:38,409
based on the DNA in their cells all
these organisms

127
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,460
shared DNA the in other words on

128
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,809
they all have jeans the genes of work
between organisms that usery cells

129
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:49,849
this is a human being there's a frog
this organism here

130
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:54,399
is like a big nose with legs it's got
amazing or factory capabilities

131
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,699
and the molecular mechanisms are often
preserved between these organisms so if

132
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,309
you study the way

133
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:03,539
cells divide in yeast you can often
understand mechanisms of cancer

134
00:07:03,539 --> 00:07:06,990
on so the Mott the molecular mechanisms
are often preserved between cells but

135
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,779
the DNA content

136
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,710
on these organisms exist because the way
that the information content

137
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,460
in their DNA is executed on the way
information is encoded in DNA is in the

138
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,449
former for

139
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,759
for what are called bases on and these
are structures those bases AG CNT

140
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,289
for AC GnT the sensor at mean cytosine
guanine and I mean

141
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:32,699
on be and these bases are linked
together in chains to form a pattern

142
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,279
so on they're attached to sugar
molecules

143
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,729
and then there's a phosphate backbone
which you can use to connect these

144
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:39,808
things together

145
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:43,349
and once you can connect molecules like
this together you have a wave including

146
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:43,998
information

147
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:47,300
because these things to stretch on for
hundreds thousands and millions

148
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,279
units long 'em

149
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,969
so if the forms a way to make patterns
on in cells

150
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:58,139
most the time DNA doesn't exist as a
single strand like that most the time it

151
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,869
exists as double strand

152
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,210
you probably heard the double helix this
is with the two strands

153
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,259
that are are bound together and they
they form this sort of

154
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:10,270
twisty structure but on that last line
ratios one

155
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,779
one said a one strand arm

156
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:17,009
because DNA exist in two strands there's
a set appearing rules which determines

157
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:18,770
how these two strands interact

158
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,710
so I sees or always paired with GE's

159
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,490
and days are always protease the idea
there is if you know the sequence have

160
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,580
one strand

161
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,080
then you know the sequence of the other
strand give the thing to consider is

162
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,289
that the strands are held together

163
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,110
by a series a very weak interactions
called hydrogen bonds in these

164
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,539
interactions easily broken

165
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,588
and can easily come back together
whereas the chain that makes up

166
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:44,620
that the stranded DNA this form by very
strong bones

167
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,339
so it's hard to break those

168
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:52,290
those chains I'm a fundamentally
important property about DNA is its

169
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,029
ability

170
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,630
to to come apart and then come back
together I'm

171
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,930
because these hydrogen bonds are weak
bonds it's really no different than

172
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,040
boiling water if you had heat water

173
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,910
water turns into steam if you had he to
TNA comes apart

174
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,730
um but but because there are these
parables

175
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:13,069
a so DNA can melt and it can come back
together

176
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:16,139
on this provides a mechanism up address
ability

177
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,139
so the pattern a bases on one strand
were only

178
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,040
come back together with it supposing
pattern on the opposite strand

179
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,490
I'm so this is the basis of a lot of
things in biology is how

180
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,800
it's how many Italian organisms
replicate themselves

181
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,709
on is how on CSI you can you can you
know find some DNA to crime scene

182
00:09:34,709 --> 00:09:38,949
and they go out the population and match
that DNA to some unknown population

183
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:42,209
so wannabes transit put into a complex
mixture

184
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,269
all humanity confined just the one
strand

185
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,509
match itself this is also the bases
above

186
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:51,649
abusing detainees computer I'm

187
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:55,420
if you could encode a problem in little
snippets of DNA

188
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,310
you can generate the opposite strand as
an infinite number solutions

189
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,740
and if those little pieces confined to
the opposite strand in the library

190
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,970
infinite solutions

191
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,920
a certain structural form you can
isolate the structure and this is how

192
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,259
people use DNA is a computer

193
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,269
I'm so it's a really powerful thing but
it's not very practical because it takes

194
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,879
you know with current method it's about
a week to solve a simple problem

195
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:21,399
I'm if you write DNA out like on paper

196
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,769
this is what it looks like on is just a
set you know there's two strands a top

197
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:27,329
down and bottom strand

198
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,750
if you so it's not that readable but if
you are familiar with DNA at all you can

199
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,920
start seeing certain structures in here
like

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,060
this ATG here that's often the beginning
a protein

201
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:41,370
arm there's another sequence in here
a.m. stingy a TTC

202
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,670
this is a recognition sequence for an
enzyme which can cut DNA into two pieces

203
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,399
on so there's a lot of enzymes in
biology

204
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,310
which will recognize various signature
sequences Indian ace the DNA can be cut

205
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,639
and since it could be cut there's also
enzymes for putting it back together

206
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,089
and this is the way that you can sort of
move genes between organisms you can

207
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:01,790
rearrange jeans

208
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:05,719
you can make a lot of DNA structures
using these and signs

209
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,870
I'm so I so the DNA encodes information
in with that information is

210
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,680
is expressed in the world is through
something called the central dogma

211
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,899
so given his piece of DNA

212
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,970
if you want to express that DNA the
first step is to express it

213
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,069
in the form of a single-stranded
molecule called are in a

214
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,269
that's one level a gene expression and
its tightly controlled by various things

215
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:31,740
the next thing is to then translate that
our name to protein

216
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,529
proteins you know they consist of 20
amino acids the amino acid code is the

217
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,430
same in all organisms

218
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,790
arm and proteins are the way to get
things done the world

219
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,879
basically all these twenty amino acids
have slightly different chemical

220
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,910
properties so it's the it's the is the
configuration have

221
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,920
amino acids in a protein which gives you
access to chemistry

222
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,550
so you can do stuff I'm all the DNA in
an organism

223
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,100
is something we call the genome if you
if you

224
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,259
if you consider all the DNA the mixup a
single organism

225
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:04,500
I'm just represent is one long strand
here

226
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,600
on so here's a sorta summary up the
genomes have a few different organisms

227
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,980
E-coli is probably the most studied
organism on the face of the earth

228
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,449
it's got about forty three hundred jeans
and its its DNA content is about four

229
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:18,819
and a half million bases

230
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:23,979
have DNA East in humans are both
complicated structures that have nucleus

231
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,370
nuclei on East has about 6,000 jeans

232
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,230
it's about 12 mega bases humans are
about 3 get a bases

233
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,449
on but the number genes is is not really
known

234
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:39,470
because he was a complicated and did
this this number has range from twenty

235
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,050
thousand

236
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,959
upwards of a hundred and fifty thousand
I'm in the best guess now is somewhere

237
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:44,980
around 23,000

238
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:50,680
yeah yet never told have about 20,000
genes

239
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,060
so are we really no different than worms
you find in your salad

240
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,500
I mean this is the kind of thing you
read the paper like all were aqui be the

241
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,379
same as words

242
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,990
but there's more to it than that because
it's not just jeans

243
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,160
its controlling how those genes are
expressed I'm so consider

244
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,430
that in 12 mega bases you got six
thousand jeans

245
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,740
in yeast about half that saw about half
the content

246
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,360
this DNA codes for those jeans so what
fifty percent did you know

247
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,389
is is code for proteins and about 50
percent

248
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,839
is regulatory information or just spaces
between genes

249
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,379
in humans it's only about three percent
the genome which codes for jeans

250
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,370
so ninety per seven-percent the DNA is
is there we don't know what it's for we

251
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,610
don't know what it does

252
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,269
why is there such a different density
and I show not apply here this is that

253
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:42,959
East genome at 12 megabits is relative
to the human genome

254
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,279
just in life on consider that DNA as a
single molecule

255
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,769
a if you were stretched out all the DNA
in 10 yourselves

256
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,220
you would-be six feet long and somehow
all the viewers

257
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,519
sells real to wrap that DNA into a tiny
little nucleus inside so

258
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,129
on this is fascinating

259
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:06,149
I'm but given that

260
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:09,720
given that the information content

261
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,970
haven't mean that were cousins are
determined by the information content in

262
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,600
their genome

263
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,529
a few years ago people thought well one
we just sequenced genomes

264
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:23,040
if it's if you know at the time that
that genome sequencing was proposed

265
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,040
people were studying stuff one thing at
a time yeah

266
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,310
more %uh well yes the ninety-seven
percent of the genome that we don't know

267
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:37,990
what does

268
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,270
on the term junk DNA tests on around but

269
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:44,689
any serious scientist doesn't really you
know

270
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,370
oh yeah it certainly does some things
you can't do without

271
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:53,330
City College charges just like well you
don't know what it does

272
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,940
I guess that means it's John I mean it's
just some other useful statement what's

273
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,260
that

274
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,380
because rumors is awesome

275
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,620
I I'm

276
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,110
so I consider that at the time

277
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,930
that people a realized we have to get
the information out of DNA

278
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:19,180
a it

279
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,490
studying a single gene made a PhD thesis
into years

280
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,160
so if you want to start on a project
like let's say you were studying some

281
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,250
aspect cancer

282
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,300
a you would take you a long time

283
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,930
like maybe 23 years just to try to find
a gene is involved in the thing you're

284
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:34,610
studying

285
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,730
and then you could use a functional
studies on that particular gene and do

286
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,690
something so you might spend five to 10
years

287
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,300
five or 10 years your life just trying
to find a single gene

288
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,350
because note that you know cells

289
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,550
and living systems are just black boxes
we don't know what gene controls what

290
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,560
on so yet sequencing technology existed

291
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,610
so why not sequenced genomes what the
reason is because at the time this is

292
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,980
being proposed I was sequencing DNA

293
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:02,410
and it took me about three days work
with radio activity China label

294
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,170
molecules

295
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,260
to get just a hundred bases sequence
that meant if I wanted to see was the 3

296
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,400
billion base human genome it would take
two hundred fifty thousand years

297
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:16,460
um so one solution is while higher
250,000 people and I'll take a year

298
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,510
a but sick but if you consider like the
space program some people

299
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,080
get really pissed off about the space
program because they say it's gonna take

300
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,800
enormous resources to do something like
you know go to mars

301
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,040
and if we were use that money in another
way we could accomplish a lot

302
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,620
on but this is an investment in
infrastructure I'm

303
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,990
and so if you set a goal

304
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,180
in and provide funding resources people
were attacked that goal and the

305
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,410
technology will change

306
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:46,000
and it has changed and such that today
using just off-the-shelf technology

307
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,860
we can collect a billion big mean a
human genome three billion bases in

308
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,770
about three weeks

309
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:54,490
and and that is changing on a daily
basis on

310
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,340
which means that you know in the not too
distant future when you go to your

311
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,570
doctor's office you might

312
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,260
you know you might know the secrets at
your own genome a which can be really

313
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,220
important for various things

314
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,190
another way to look at this problem is
if information content is the limiting

315
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,420
is a limiting aspect in biology I

316
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,830
around the time that you know there's
going to be sequenced was around here

317
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,939
and this is where we are now so this is
a graph the information content in

318
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,600
GenBank

319
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,280
so when you have an event like this
where you go from a long time with

320
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,490
almost no information

321
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:31,620
and then suddenly a huge shift like this
things change it causes a paradigm shift

322
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,220
in with you think about the system
you're studying dominant you can't

323
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,120
deceive looks a little like internet
usage where

324
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,160
you know back here almost no news on the
internet I'm in now almost everybody is

325
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,180
on so genomes again

326
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,860
I'm just because we have the sequence a
genome doesn't mean that we know what an

327
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,940
Evite codes for

328
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,310
right I'm we can try to predict where
genes are

329
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,110
a but we still don't know what those
jeans do

330
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,800
on in addition 12 the fundamental
components which makes like an ape

331
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,300
or worm different than a human is not
just the jeans because we share so many

332
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,770
G's in common with East

333
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,400
and worms in apes um but the control
elements to turn those genes on or off

334
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,910
on this is a right area biology which is
waiting to be

335
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:19,080
explore its called the cis-regulatory
code

336
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,439
it is it's that control mechanisms for
jeans are

337
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,750
so having all this information primarily
what it does is it causes people to

338
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,190
think about the system in any way

339
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,750
if you're studying a black box and you
don't have a good map it

340
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,800
you know you're gonna sort of put on in
one place and see what happens in

341
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,330
another place but if you have occurred
an entire map

342
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,370
it's like is like certainly having a map
of the world you get is now and it'd

343
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,750
did you have a question

344
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,680
is it is the genome is the information
content to the genome

345
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,390
both necessary and sufficient it depends
on the organism

346
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,320
on for instance

347
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,929
a cell let me just talk about this for a
second thinking about the whole system

348
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,990
in 1996 East was the first you carry out
a organism sequenced

349
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,560
now you've got twelve megabytes 12
Megabass is a sequence

350
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,060
you can predict that there's about six
thousand jeans

351
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,770
a for the first time people are
realizing women I

352
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,280
any I need to know what a database is
because I need to keep track of all

353
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,110
these genes

354
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,980
their methods for knocking jeans out
views %uh

355
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,570
so if you've got 6,000 targets and law
graduate students

356
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,610
you can say well let's start knocking
out jeans and see what happens

357
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,650
so what what what was done as these
community made a knockout collection

358
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,810
they made they try to make six thousand
different strains have yeast

359
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,889
in which each used was missing a
different gene

360
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:47,670
so that they were able to make about
4,000 streaming

361
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,060
4,000 strains because about 2,000 the
jeans are absolutely essential

362
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,429
you knock out the gene the organism is
dead right on

363
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,970
so necessary and sufficient it sort of
depends

364
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:02,680
some some single mark outs not catching
axe

365
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,680
the Easter alive you wanna knock out a
second gene now the stirred

366
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,730
%ah is there information content
required for organisms that outside the

367
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,350
genome

368
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:25,870
arm what's that

369
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,160
well there's there's metagenomic
elements

370
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,210
so like E-coli has a genome

371
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,100
Easter genomes but they also have
plasmas

372
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,660
and these plasmas like little circles of
DNA that can be shifted between strains

373
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,250
I am 12 Cardinal DNA is also yet so

374
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,460
my country we make is so an extra
genomic element yet so

375
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,530
you know was an organism anyway

376
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:55,530
I mean look at mad cow disease you have
a protein which is infectious

377
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,550
there's no nucleic acid it's a it's a
structure it's a self propagating

378
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,440
structure

379
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,330
arm so one thing that changed

380
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,649
a along with all this okay East you got
six thousand jeans

381
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,130
6,000 targets well make make copies of
all the genes

382
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,140
so do six thousand PCR reactions and
make six thousand peace the DNA

383
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,150
and then build a robot I mean most most
microbiologists are not robot builder's

384
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,930
but is actually not hard to build these
robots the use of the shelf technology

385
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,610
so here's an XY 0 but this is a linear
stage

386
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,320
this is on your stage this thing is on
your stage so here's

387
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,750
a homemade robot they can execute motion
in three dimensions

388
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,260
a so people started realizing well if
you can

389
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:40,740
have XYZ robot and you've got us a
genetic elements there are a lot of

390
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,730
things you can do

391
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,250
but one thing that we do is we take and
we'd

392
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,240
create slides in which we spot down a
little bit have ever used in on a slide

393
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,760
so here's a slide got six thousand spots
on it representing the entire use genome

394
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,300
100 class so for the first time ever

395
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,080
remember I said that people use to
surgeons one at a time right well

396
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,889
why do an experiment to measure just one
gene if you can measure 6,000 jeans

397
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,060
if you do measures 6,000 jeans the
summer with the data looks like if you

398
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,320
scan that slide after after doing
experiment

399
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,810
each one the stock has a different gene
the color the dot represents the level

400
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,070
of expression that gene

401
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,570
but you don't even have to know with the
jeans due to measure them

402
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,169
but let's say you're comparing you know
healthy tissue cancerous tissue

403
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,420
and you see some spots fluctuating does
your things to go study

404
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,400
right and now you've found a bunch of
jeans the difficulty here

405
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,580
is that nobody knows what to do this is
that this is the six thousand point

406
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,129
vector

407
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,570
representing the state of a system a

408
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,169
again most microbiologist are not very
good at math that's why people go into

409
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,990
biology right

410
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,890
um I'm

411
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,210
so how do you you know and this is every
experiment you do is going to generate a

412
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,780
six thousand point doctor with used

413
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,050
you do in humans you can have 40,000
point doctors on

414
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,129
how you compare 40,000 point doctor how
do you compare a hundred

415
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,530
experiments so the data generation is
huge on

416
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,170
you know physicists and mathematicians
are getting involved now

417
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,500
but the main point I want to make is
that now you've gone from a black box

418
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,920
that you used to be able to poke

419
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,910
and measure one output but now you can
poke it and measure the entire state of

420
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,150
the transcriptional system

421
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:22,630
you can measure the you get a snapshot
of the activity all the genes that once

422
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,670
on and this is really powerful a

423
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:29,060
and so this is what you probably heard
the term genomics this is what you know

424
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,659
mixes

425
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,980
its instead of looking at things one at
a time you think of them everything at a

426
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,380
time

427
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,810
you wanna like you want to study the
spinal cord development

428
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,960
study snakes they're all spinal cord
right

429
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,980
on but that means you have to sequence
the genome but we can see chris did you

430
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,450
know now

431
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:49,110
um so the whole genome with the organism
you want to measure all the genes

432
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,620
to an array experiment you can measure
all the genes on there's there's

433
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,220
but you know when I showed you was
measuring the or any level over gene

434
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,570
that already has to be translated into
protein and that is also regulated step

435
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:04,840
so there are methods for studying of
proteins have an organism once

436
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,870
arm all these proteins interact with
each other

437
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:11,830
proteins interact with each other the
interactive DNA does all kinds of

438
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,060
interactions in the cell

439
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,159
so if you want to think about 20 can
love those things you can do

440
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,350
high-throughput screens to try to
measure all the interactions at any

441
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,100
given time

442
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,460
and and but again it's just one point
I'm

443
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,870
you know if you keep the cells this
happens if you call themselves down this

444
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:32,080
happened to dispose of the aspirin that
happens if you know do something else

445
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,669
put them in UV light whatever I am

446
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:39,010
so with all this information now

447
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:42,580
people are thinking in a different way
everybody wants to have a network map of

448
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,370
the organism

449
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:48,190
arm so this is a map of E-coli and as
protein-protein interactions E coli

450
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,240
and you can start seeing structures from
these maps I mean

451
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,170
people been studying that was for a long
time but we don't know really what they

452
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,270
mean and biology

453
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:59,290
arm here's another map view East

454
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,520
protein-protein interactions more
proteins

455
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,300
more interactions a

456
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,650
yes the Liceo the dots are are
individual proteins and the lines

457
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,680
between the dots

458
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,130
reflect that somebody has made an
interaction between those proteins

459
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:19,040
so one question is mean if your gonna
measure six thousand things here in six

460
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,030
thousand things there

461
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,629
do you know your experiments to measure
all the protein-protein interactions

462
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:27,350
you have a way to summarize the data to
view the data to do something with it

463
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,320
most people I know they want to be able
to draw these pictures but they don't

464
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,139
know how to do any sort of network math

465
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,560
they don't have a computer on these
things they don't necessarily know

466
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,659
does this they have the predictive power
what does it tell me how can I how can I

467
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,310
compute

468
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,909
on the structure arm

469
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,970
which is you know i think thats a good
thing to do

470
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,180
but even if you can't do that you
probably look at the structure right

471
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,960
here and realize that the protein at the
centers pop you really important protein

472
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,610
on um

473
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,860
but along with these sorta network maps
on

474
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,650
people also started thinking their data
in terms of these kinda structures

475
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,960
so here's a little map summarizing sea
urchin development

476
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,100
it turns out that this map is also true
for humans the sea urchins and humans

477
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,580
early on have very similar developmental
events

478
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,270
and you can you can sorta represent
those events in terms of

479
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,490
figures like this and went when I first
saw this

480
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,890
the first thing I thought it was it
looks like a circuit diagram there's

481
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,380
there's things which were activators
distinguish the repressors arm

482
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:32,570
in if you can and Cody you know your
biological system

483
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:37,120
was something like this now I kinda
wanna know how do I tweet this

484
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,660
I do understand the different components
is obviously cause the modules

485
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,950
arm it's got all these different parts a

486
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,760
should we be able to sort of look at
this pic counterparts and make our own

487
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,250
network diagram something

488
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,810
yeah

489
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:57,230
can it be displayed doesn't however the
table on

490
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,150
yeah I think you can

491
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:04,980
yeah on a so if we revisit now

492
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,790
what is by having me I'm

493
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:12,360
so so what does what does all that just
leave us it leaves us you but now we've

494
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,240
got we're swimming with information

495
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,620
were surrounded by genes and parts we're
surrounded by

496
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:21,650
entire systems unlevel snapshots of
activity

497
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:24,650
on so now people think about things in a
different way

498
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:31,650
arm

499
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,750
so if we wanna now probe systems we can
start asking questions along this level

500
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,630
um you know you want to understand the
system so you can sort of change

501
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,860
existing systems now you can see the
system

502
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,480
you can change it you can knock out
jeans you can study

503
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,520
you know remember those jeans and as
promoters which control the jeans

504
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,600
so you can try to understand what the
activity the promoters is

505
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,180
you can put genes in places where
they're not supposed to be you know

506
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,770
maybe there's a gene in your toenails
it's not supposed to be expressing your

507
00:27:57,770 --> 00:27:58,340
eyeball

508
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,430
so what happens to express a toenail
gene in your eyeball

509
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,620
on if you have jeans

510
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,860
you cannot you cannot only sorta miss
expressed them to knock them out but you

511
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,700
can try changing them to see what
happens you tweak them

512
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,850
a you can try to create new proteins

513
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:17,660
which is almost impossible because
trying to avoid try to start with just

514
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:21,170
general sequence space in a ball
something new on

515
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:24,700
it's basically impossible it's
impossible because its its

516
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,990
it takes too much DNA to cut to try to
search through any consequence pace

517
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,290
but it's also impossible cuz when you
have to try to do it you end up evolving

518
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:35,000
things which bind to class in plastic
and then

519
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,930
you don't get anywhere I'm but that
doesn't mean that there are other ways

520
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,930
to go about

521
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,950
making new proteins arm and

522
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:46,320
these days we also talk a lot about can
we just create a whole new systems

523
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,970
given that we've got so many views on
the system's can we just create new ones

524
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,720
um so before talk about Thomson

525
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,340
individual circuits I want to to just
remind people have or maybe introduce

526
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,240
people to

527
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,580
a few basic components I'm here's a
figure

528
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,590
a gene on you would be expressed in this
direction

529
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,050
and remember that genes are promoters
and a

530
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,280
whether this gene is expressed or not
depends on the

531
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,800
sequences in this promoter and it
depends on whether those proteins run

532
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,340
which will bind this promoter and turn
the gene on

533
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,929
or other proteins which combines
promoter and keep the gene of

534
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:27,800
on proteins which bind and keep the gene
offer called repressors

535
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,150
arm and repressors I'm can be
inactivated

536
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,240
for instance if you're a if Europe
bacteria

537
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,440
and you have a gene for lactose you want
to express that gene

538
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,490
much was actually lactose around in your
environment so

539
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,190
the lactose gene will be repressed until
there's lactose around

540
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,410
and what lactose will do it interact
with the protein and within russia the

541
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,010
protein

542
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,610
the repressor comes off another gene is
expressed so

543
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,530
there's activators and as repressors
this is the same bacteria

544
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,580
in millions are some things are just way
more complicated

545
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,000
arm but nonetheless given a bunch jeans

546
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,429
given a buncha transcription factors the
general system

547
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,580
is that its see you know signals coming
to the outside world

548
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,600
are and they transmit the signals
through transcription factors to

549
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,790
activate gene expression

550
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:18,300
so if you want to try to convey
understand this system

551
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,600
arm there certain tools that are
available I want one sort or

552
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,630
is something called a reporter gene
where

553
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,850
arm you can hook things up to a gene
such that when their genes expressed

554
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,260
you can see it being expressed another
thing to do is to simply not cook

555
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,270
something to the gene but to just
replace the gene

556
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,090
with the reporter gene that way you can
measure the activity of his promoter

557
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,670
a by looking at their the reporter and
some examples

558
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,630
reporter genes I'm are shown here
there's a there's a bunch of diff kinds

559
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,760
reporter genes

560
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,900
but when the most popular ones is

561
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,310
protein is found in jellyfish it's
called green fluorescent protein

562
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,850
it was like that from jellyfish you know

563
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:05,160
has a long history GFP I'm but it turns
out to be a really powerful tool because

564
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,640
you can shine light on an organism Intel
AppUp expressing GFP you're not

565
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,690
on there's another you know you've all
seen fireflies maybe

566
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,230
you can does an enzyme which which
allows fireflies to make light

567
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:18,230
and so you can take that enzyme and use
that as a reporter gene

568
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,740
there's a a protein which metabolize
sugar

569
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:25,480
you can use that as a gene this is a
hundred different use colonies

570
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,840
all with the particular promoter hooked
up to this reporter gene

571
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm in the reason why they're different
levels have blue there is because

572
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,370
each colony has a different mutation in
the promoter

573
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,410
so the mutation the promoter is
affecting the expression of this gene

574
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:42,030
you can see that here on some jeans

575
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:45,570
some reporter genes here's one that
codes for diphtheria toxin

576
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,159
so if this reporter gene is expressed it
actually kills the cells

577
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,410
now why would you want the reporter gene
which kills cells

578
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,880
consider that you know diabetes in
diabetes in your pancreas there certain

579
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,060
cells for beta cells

580
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:03,820
which produce insulin arm for various
reasons like pregnant women go to

581
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,950
fluctuations and

582
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,260
in the the massive their beta cells
sometimes the best selves just gone

583
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,790
missing

584
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,080
and then you've got diabetes sue if you
want a system in which you can study the

585
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,129
regeneration a beta cells

586
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,140
you could target this gene into beta
cells

587
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,070
on in the case in this case there's
someone doing this with a take

588
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:26,870
diphtheria toxin and they put they put
it under the control the controllable

589
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:27,620
reporter

590
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,650
so in your a controllable promoter

591
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,160
in this case the from work to be turned
on/off attempt recycling so

592
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:39,210
you have a a strain of mice which are
expressing which have this gene

593
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,140
in all the beta cells and you can
activate it by simply giving the mice

594
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,850
does attempt recycling so when you do
that the my suddenly become diabetic

595
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,350
and that allows you to study what
happens when the cells regenerate

596
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,450
themselves

597
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:55,460
if they regenerate themselves so you can
get this team to express a particular

598
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
tissue

599
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,730
and you can use it to study certain
phenomena I'm

600
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:03,710
yeah

601
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:07,419
I it's not always on so it whether it's
on or not depends on

602
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:14,419
if this promoters beings activated or
not he would lower if there's the right

603
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:18,169
metabolite around so it uses some a
tablet to generate light

604
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:23,720
and yeah on so here's some examples of
organisms which have been

605
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,960
transfected were changed or modified by

606
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,039
putting reporter genes into them through
the desert

607
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,499
to pictures of mice that have GFP inside
the mouse

608
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:37,389
so the green the mice a green I some be
made a green rabbit

609
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:41,779
p a these are fish the you can find in
fish stores

610
00:33:41,779 --> 00:33:46,269
so in this case these fish are
expressing GFP up but there's a lot of

611
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:47,799
fluorescent proteins in the ocean

612
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:51,710
and so people have isolated either Peter
mutated GFP to be a different color

613
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,249
or they look at other see species and
found other colors a protein's

614
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:59,999
one is why FP yellow fluorescent protein
for them so RFP red fluorescent protein

615
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:04,200
any such as zebra fish that have been
transfected with these reporter genes

616
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,749
on here's an example uva

617
00:34:07,749 --> 00:34:12,810
appear so on the pic on the right as a
regular pic the pic on the left is a pic

618
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,020
that's been transfected with

619
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,839
why FP on now I should point out that
people just do this for kicks

620
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:24,099
I mean the rabbit was actually serve an
art project but the other things

621
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:29,520
I'm the reason for doing this is so you
can study certain things

622
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,649
for instance here's a picture of a mouse
with lymphoma

623
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:36,049
and you can actively in real time
without killing a mouse

624
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,710
study the progress of lymphoma arm

625
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,339
another phenomena you can study is on
when people have

626
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:47,699
blood transfusions you know you're like
a like a bone marrow transplant

627
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,230
arm often you end up finding cells like
let's say twenty years after someone has

628
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,440
a bone marrow transplant

629
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,670
if you section their brain you'll find
nerve cells which came from the

630
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,720
donor even though there were no nerve
cells

631
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,380
in the donor Boehner also

632
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,609
you know once you this is a Purkinje
neurons and once you're born

633
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,770
you don't make it work engine Iran's so
if

634
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,980
yet if you take a green mouse and have
it give a true a

635
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,310
sometime transfusion or bone marrow
transplant to a sick mouse

636
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,950
on and then looking at my house later
you can find cells

637
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,069
that were never transferred but yet are
there meaning that

638
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:32,180
either cells are fusing or there's some
strange kinda event going on but as

639
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,250
the point is that you can study these
things if you have markers on

640
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,440
here's an example of modifying herpes
simplex virus

641
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,710
by adding to the Sybaris gene a so

642
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,380
you can with this allows you to do is
track an active infection

643
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,210
here's a mouse which on day one had was
exposed to a virus and its allies

644
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,400
a and then over time the virus spreads

645
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,079
into the nasal cavity and everything but
then by Dane I'm infections gone

646
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,400
you know you can study this without some
kind reporter gene

647
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,690
released the weight they studied before
reporter genes to kill the mouse and

648
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,180
slice of his head into the you know

649
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,819
look at stuff on so

650
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:14,880
so with all this genomics with all these
modifications we can do now

651
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,540
on so this notion has been coming up

652
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,299
you a lot of conversations I've had in
the last two or three years with people

653
00:36:21,299 --> 00:36:22,480
I

654
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,990
where people are starting to think I've
biology is parts

655
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:31,810
yeah

656
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,430
are you can you can try to put a
reporter gene on any particular gene

657
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,919
on you what you don't know is if you

658
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,990
touch a glove on to the into some gene
if the original protein will be

659
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:47,700
affected somehow you know sometimes the
protein will cease to function

660
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,030
it's got a reporter gene attached to it
a in that case you can just try taking

661
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:52,750
the promoter

662
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,849
you know it's okay if a cell has two
copies a promoter

663
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:59,040
so you can you can leave the original
gene in place with this

664
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,170
promoter and its gene but then copy the
promoter and have a reporter to that and

665
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,130
put it somewhere else

666
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,490
so that you can sort of view the active
in reporter

667
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:13,580
with a report urging yeah it's not

668
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,580
well reversible is it that's a good
question because for instance if your

669
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,299
gonna engineer a virus to go to go
attack cancer cells

670
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,900
you wanna know it you can control the
event and that something's not gonna

671
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,500
happen to it

672
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,130
so reversibility is something active
area have

673
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,750
no engineering on and

674
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,250
it also depends though like I'll E-coli

675
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,680
in yeast which were transfected with
things depending on how you to inspect

676
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,970
them taken some time to check out the
DNA and not have it anymore

677
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:48,970
yeah it depends very small organisms
organisms so

678
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,869
typically you would you would serve try
to clone the reporter gene onto a piece

679
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,369
of DNA in the lab but then getting it
into the genome into the organism

680
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:59,390
it just varies a like the

681
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,049
while yet as there is on

682
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:07,210
so here's a this guy the he's a
developmental biologist for now he's

683
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,410
into systems biology

684
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:11,480
and you know heat makes the

685
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,390
the comment scientific fields like
species arise by descent with

686
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,150
modification

687
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:20,050
so things have been the same in
molecular biology for

688
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:24,750
past couple decades but now with all
this information all these genes things

689
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:25,450
are changing

690
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,700
to to sort this to this notion that
people are surrounded by piles of genes

691
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,540
and proteins

692
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,830
so the idea that biology is parts a is
kinda out there

693
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,880
and if you're surrounded by parts don't
use or want to do something with them

694
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:41,210
if you think you understand the system
can you put them together in some leeway

695
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,470
p so

696
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:49,230
what would be the simplest thing you
could do with some parts so these guys

697
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,440
decided well

698
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,520
let's see if we can do something very
very simple let's see if we can design a

699
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,080
cell

700
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,720
which exists im into stand either two
states and will call the toggle switch

701
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,270
on and as a as a as a construct

702
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,339
this is what it would look like given
the things sort of already told you

703
00:39:07,339 --> 00:39:11,690
arm you have a reporter gene see you got
something you can track and see

704
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,980
if it's on or not on and that's it if
the cell is expressing reporter gene

705
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,849
it'll be green

706
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:20,800
if it's not personal 14 won't be green a

707
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,310
and so how can you how can you serb make
that sell

708
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,609
either exist in a green state were not
reinstated

709
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:31,730
using from off-the-shelf components
here's one way to do it

710
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,760
I you can take to differ promoters

711
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,980
he to these promoters is repressive a
promoter meaning he could be turned off

712
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,780
for the protein

713
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:43,080
and you make each promoter encode let me
know

714
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,390
control the repressor the officer
promoter

715
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,640
on so this this is sort of a confusing
way to look at it but the other thing is

716
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,080
remember repressors

717
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,580
can be inactivated by inducers here's a
different view

718
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,098
same thing to promoters facing apart
each one

719
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:03,140
is going to control the expression of a
gene arm

720
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,348
and depending on the configuration of
this whole thing

721
00:40:06,349 --> 00:40:09,930
a reporter will be expressed so if you
can see if you turn

722
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:13,000
if if this promoter is on its gonna make
this repressor

723
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,570
by expressing transcripts which could
translate into protein

724
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,119
so if this promoters on this promotes
gonna be of

725
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:23,270
if his promoters of

726
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,339
you're not gonna make the reporter gene
the cells are not be green

727
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:29,930
that's one state the other states

728
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,210
is if this promoters on

729
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,210
on then you're gonna express this whole
transcription unit meaning you're gonna

730
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:38,190
make a repressor

731
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:42,470
and reporter gene that repressor is
gonna turn this promoter of

732
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:45,710
on so you have green cells enough for
motor

733
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,720
so that's good its it's that simple

734
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,030
that you you designed to sell which
exists only

735
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,070
in either two states not partially
between the states

736
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:59,290
I the green or it's not green so what
characteristics does this have

737
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,430
that people might might think about 1

738
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,690
is that 'em it has memory

739
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:10,570
because these repressors respond to
things

740
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,790
so up if he the cell can exist

741
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,900
in 12 States and you can add the inducer
by the repressor whenever you want

742
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,180
so consider for instance like if you
design a repressor

743
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,270
to recognize some environmental
contaminant

744
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,790
and the cells are sitting out there in a
stream bed and disposed to recognize the

745
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,170
venue

746
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:34,320
I don't know finney p cadmium comes by

747
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,660
I'm if if the cells are exposed to
cadmium maybe I'll turn green

748
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,850
and they're gonna stay green even if the
cabin goes away because once the switch

749
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,799
has been flipped

750
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,170
it stays in that state a.m.

751
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:49,390
but then you can also be set it by
adding the other inducer so you can

752
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:51,960
stably make the sale going to one side
or the other

753
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,390
he'll stay in estates which got memory
and you can always reset it

754
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:58,799
so this is a really simple example it's
probably one of the simplest examples

755
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,240
are taking components

756
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,470
in doing some engineering some attention
engineering to make the cell

757
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,990
do want two things on in this is what
the DNA would look like

758
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,930
so you can make this in the lab where
you can order it from a company those

759
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:12,169
companies which do DNA synthesis

760
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,480
arm but it's basically just putting a
much phones together in a particular

761
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,619
configuration

762
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,680
I'm so this is an example love

763
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,759
what you would call bioengineering her
work

764
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,830
yeah it works it works

765
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,339
yet they can make a green E-coli but it
doesn't mean

766
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:34,770
you can imagine a here's here's an
example a few years ago

767
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,900
a used to be this column in nature on

768
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,930
where this guy would come up with wacky
ideas so this is like 20 years ago this

769
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,540
guy said why don't we just take a heroin
addicts

770
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:48,480
and infect their guns with the E-coli
that make heroin

771
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,369
because then or methadone because then

772
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,619
you can just you know have all the
methadone you want you want to break

773
00:42:55,619 --> 00:42:56,869
into people's houses

774
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,630
if you want to get off it just takes
many by arts

775
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,560
I'm but it was a joke back then but this
would be a a system where if you need

776
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,720
some drug

777
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,420
I you can induce the production of that
drug for some sort I'm

778
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,500
we were turned off you can induce is off
his office so the reporter

779
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:17,800
you know I said you could be green but
the reporter could be anything

780
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,890
I'm so there's a lot of uses for this
kind of thing

781
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,549
on and but again it's best for the most
basic thing that one could think up to

782
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,530
do

783
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:31,080
arm and its hard most molecular
biologist don't think in terms of this

784
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:34,160
stuff because usually biology is way too
complicated to try to do something

785
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,799
intentionally

786
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,880
that on but that doesn't mean that given
all these parts

787
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,770
in given certain principles that you
can't try to do something

788
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:44,380
and so it turns out that engineers have
been dealing with these kinds of

789
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,880
problems for a long time

790
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,700
a first of all one reason why it's hard
to do this is a molecular biology is

791
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,700
because there's no standardization

792
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,300
not have the parts fit together in the
same way if in my lab I'm working on

793
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,940
something and someone else is out there
working on something

794
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,060
we're not going to the same way when are
our pieces are gonna fit together in the

795
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,009
same way

796
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,010
so there's been no effort standardized
stuff

797
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,950
especially outside these community on
but that doesn't mean it's not possible

798
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,290
to make certain standard

799
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:14,050
fillings the second thing is on
something called abstraction

800
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,780
I'm one way to deal with complexity is
to just hide it and make it not

801
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,599
necessarily

802
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:21,660
not necessary for you to know if for
instance if you buy

803
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,490
you know about the stereo components you
can have them together without knowing

804
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,109
anything about voltages

805
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:29,598
you have to have an oscilloscope report
meter to hook up your stereo

806
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,200
and that's because abstraction in the
third principles

807
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,020
something called decoupling where a lot
of biological elements are just way

808
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,810
maybe over engineered they're just they
have so many functions that we don't

809
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,980
know about this hidden stuff in there

810
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,619
on and a lot of that stuff to be
reengineered be simplified

811
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,710
if you want a protein which is one
function

812
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:52,460
study a and record it so it just has
that one function and not ten other

813
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,560
functions

814
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,950
so these are principles that one could
apply to biology and if you to apply

815
00:44:57,950 --> 00:44:59,010
these principles

816
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,770
you can get stuff done so there's been a
group at MIT who's trying to do these

817
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:03,910
kinds of things

818
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:07,330
us to hear something called the registry
a standard biological parts

819
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,020
where they look into the genome and they
say look we all use promoters

820
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:15,800
we all use activators will use
repressors what we characterize these

821
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,530
things

822
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,960
let's measure their activities so we can
report them in standard ways

823
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,330
let's give them the same feelings on the
end so that we can put them together in

824
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,549
a standard way

825
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:31,410
yet

826
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:34,989
oh yes so the question is is there a
risk for doing this there is

827
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:38,759
a I'll try to address that hint

828
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:42,930
um but you can make

829
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,890
can watch the parts and if you can make
it looks a parts can you do something

830
00:45:45,890 --> 00:45:46,440
interesting

831
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:51,499
a so let's let's just applied East
engineering principles to a simple

832
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,079
system

833
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,890
on here's where you want to engineer
some bacteria

834
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,089
which usually don't smoke very good um
to

835
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,759
to do either two things if they're going
an exponential phase so if you take some

836
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,869
some liquid broth and put bacteria and
their

837
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:07,900
to grow in what's called like wide open
you know

838
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,690
foot pedal to the metal fallout mode
where they're consuming all the

839
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,190
nutrients they grow to certain rate

840
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,859
but at some point the exhaust all the
nutrients and a slowdown in its

841
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:16,900
consideration

842
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,559
that's two different phases exponential
and saturated

843
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,660
arm and this group wanted to make it so
that when they were growing

844
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,019
in saturation face this from like mint
but when they exhausted all the

845
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,160
nutrients and stop growing Islamic
bananas

846
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,989
on it's not that hard to do because

847
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:37,690
there's a Gina petunias which can take
known metabolites in e.coli

848
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:42,209
and convert those something that smells
like mint there's a gene from East

849
00:46:42,209 --> 00:46:45,890
which can convert unknown alcohol into
an acetate

850
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:49,259
personal like bananas so if you want to
make this

851
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:52,259
construct a you could simply have to
take

852
00:46:52,259 --> 00:46:55,670
E-coli and in and these two genes and

853
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,729
make some something called devices
soldiers will be here's where

854
00:46:58,729 --> 00:46:59,920
abstraction gets involved

855
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,979
instead of taking the complexity if you
could go to the standard registry a

856
00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:04,079
biological parts

857
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,359
and Paul of these devices from the shelf
then you put them together

858
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:12,969
in this case the chassis is a strain of
E coli was somebody has already made

859
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:16,479
so that it doesn't stink very much it
doesn't really smell like anything

860
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:19,650
it's an off-the-shelf part on

861
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:24,319
he to these devices is composed of those
two genes they showed some regulatory

862
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,308
stuff arm so in the end you've got to
reporters

863
00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:32,039
one is going to smell like meant was
missed like banana remembered

864
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:35,279
they have to be controlled by the cycle
of the cell like what state the cells

865
00:47:35,279 --> 00:47:35,829
are in

866
00:47:35,829 --> 00:47:38,829
so you can use a promoter in this case

867
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:42,519
the promoter here is a promoter this on
when the cells

868
00:47:42,519 --> 00:47:45,989
are in stationary phase but it's not on

869
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:50,539
when they're in rapid growth phase okay
but that's really all you need

870
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:55,309
because on you can take that same
promoter and go to the registry a parts

871
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:59,049
and get something called inverter so
with the inverter does

872
00:47:59,049 --> 00:48:02,170
is it says it just inverse the signal
coming from here

873
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,380
so if this is gonna be on stationary
phase then you can spend

874
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,259
and putting inverter in front that
element that control element will invert

875
00:48:09,259 --> 00:48:10,180
its activity

876
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,589
so now you're gonna control this gene
make it to the upside with that does

877
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:16,989
so I am even told you what an inverter
is at the molecular level

878
00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:19,539
but you don't even have to know what it
is because that's obstruction working

879
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:20,019
for you

880
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:23,039
are and of course the inverter has parts
which

881
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,459
cause it haven't heard activity arm so
there's a there's a whole movement

882
00:48:27,459 --> 00:48:31,229
love it and started by these guys time
92 nd

883
00:48:31,229 --> 00:48:33,479
called the internationally
genetically-engineered machines

884
00:48:33,479 --> 00:48:34,239
competition

885
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,930
it started just a few years ago and
every year it's been more than doubling

886
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:38,779
in size

887
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:41,979
on any ideas for people to get together
and think

888
00:48:41,979 --> 00:48:46,089
love ways to take parts and put them
together in novel ways to do things

889
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:50,759
on here's just a couple of examples I
love a cell-cell signaling network

890
00:48:50,759 --> 00:48:54,920
where cells with the same proteins are
signaling each other and depending on

891
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,789
the location and

892
00:48:55,789 --> 00:48:59,140
the depending on their gross location on

893
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,749
they're sending out signals and
responding in different ways on

894
00:49:02,749 --> 00:49:05,999
these are e.coli cells which are cycling
through three different colors a

895
00:49:05,999 --> 00:49:06,839
protein's

896
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:11,239
on here's a network for for engineering
three different cell types to play the

897
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,109
Simon game

898
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:16,288
where the cells will only respond if
they're given 3 Q's in a particular

899
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:17,019
sequence

900
00:49:17,019 --> 00:49:20,279
if you mess up the secrets they won't
respond arm

901
00:49:20,279 --> 00:49:23,539
these are E-coli which have been
engineered to respond to light

902
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:27,430
so in response to light they pump out
two molecules arm

903
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,609
here's an example using used to grow

904
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:34,249
a a malaria drug arm and business

905
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:38,910
this is a example have getting mice to
see a collared vacancy before

906
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,078
arm it's not necessarily a circuit but
it's just the way I've

907
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,930
changing and heading into actively to a
system that I thought people would find

908
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:45,558
interesting

909
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:48,849
I'm so I think

910
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:52,049
the last things decoupling

911
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:55,349
or discover belief quickly the idea here
is to reduce complexity

912
00:49:55,349 --> 00:49:59,739
on this is a viral genome viral genomes
are packed really really tight

913
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:02,929
they're hard to study because there's so
many elements

914
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:07,269
on which overlap so here's two genes
which overlap with each other

915
00:50:07,269 --> 00:50:10,509
so they're hard to study you don't know
why the overlap you don't know if

916
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:11,619
there's some

917
00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:15,299
if they have to overlap arm so this
guide you and he took the

918
00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:19,589
T-seventy know much as shown here in
hebrew he separated all the overlapping

919
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:20,660
genes

920
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:25,160
and basically made six hundred
simultaneous changes the genome

921
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:29,089
and yet the phage are still alive after
all that

922
00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:32,578
on is a form of oppression but but

923
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:35,699
the notion a biological compression is

924
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,469
is difficult and you know this is the
first example of someone taking a genome

925
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:40,719
novel approach

926
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,489
making so many simultaneous changes
anything is still alive

927
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:47,549
on so this is something that people are
doing now is trying to tweak

928
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:51,839
genomes and how me change so you can
simplify the system so it's easier to

929
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,709
study

930
00:50:52,709 --> 00:50:55,199
this could be really important if you
want to try to design a virus that's

931
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,190
going to attack cancer cells

932
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,559
I'm sought that some skin stop there
because there's some

933
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,799
well last thing is arm parts

934
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:08,140
we need more parts if you wanna make
parts find parts and use parts me more

935
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,459
parts to this guy

936
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:12,569
on one out filtered seawater around the
earth

937
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:17,058
and edited by sleeping like a million
jeans just in seawater I'm

938
00:51:17,059 --> 00:51:21,140
so now we got supports I'm

939
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,150
it's very principle very important that
on

940
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:26,969
these engineering principles I talked
about there's no known engineering

941
00:51:26,969 --> 00:51:32,059
principles for dealing with machines
that reproduce or evolve

942
00:51:32,059 --> 00:51:36,170
this is essential to think about because
like you said there are risks here

943
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:40,209
arm in dealing with them is gonna
require a lot of open standards and open

944
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,410
community

945
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:46,819
a sharing information much like the same
expertise system hacker community

946
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:49,929
be and so on so

947
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:56,929
me that's it here

948
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:09,230
question

949
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:19,160
yes %uh the the question is do with cost

950
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:23,609
be it said it can be expensive to do
biological research

951
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:28,019
but if you've ever thought about biotech
startups they often take place in

952
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,259
people's garages so there are ways to

953
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:33,459
to there are ways to get things done

954
00:52:33,459 --> 00:52:36,650
that aren't that expensive but there's
also things like make magazine which

955
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,249
will tell you how to build the thermal
cycler

956
00:52:38,249 --> 00:52:41,469
on for like 100 bucks so

957
00:52:41,469 --> 00:52:44,140
you can do a lot of powerful things
without a hundred dollars a technology

958
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,190
for

959
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:48,589
for that for that 100 or PC technology
you can build new jeans which

960
00:52:48,589 --> 00:52:55,589
I'm so it is possible to do things even
with a lot of money

961
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:04,850
yeah

962
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,348
yet what the lunatics

963
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:27,119
that's why we need open community arm
because you have to be able to monitor

964
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:27,670
each other

965
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:30,890
if somebody doesn't bad you need a lot
of knowledge will give the respond

966
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,650
on the last thing is that that you know
that the defense department is thinking

967
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,329
about this

968
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:39,410
so companies which do gene synthesis if
you decide not to do yourself you can

969
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,839
ordered

970
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:44,160
genes from a company they're watching if
you order smallpox virus

971
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,788
you're gonna have a knock on your door
so we have to be done I think

972
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:54,789
the next talk has come

973
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,849
you I'm right

974
00:53:58,849 --> 00:53:59,200
yes
