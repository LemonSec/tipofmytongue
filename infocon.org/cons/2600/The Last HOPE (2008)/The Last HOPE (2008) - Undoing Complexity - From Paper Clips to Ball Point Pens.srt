1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,230
New York you almost made it through the
first day

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,910
it'll be dark soon but don't leave
there's plenty more common

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,790
check out the Robert steals

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,839
books if you like got the DVD purchase
area is gonna be selling them through

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,890
midnight minus a minute or two tomorrow
night when the heat is on for hours

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,410
multi-hour spy improv tel aviv exciting
later on tonight got a couple things in

7
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,080
this room in the fourth track

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,120
we got a extravaganza

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,230
film all high the things going on make
sure your

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,030
plan to hang around up next is
understanding

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,760
complexity ressie some

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,360
locks I think is Marco get your name

13
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,930
the white talk to my sorry another

14
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:54,510
yeah welcome everyone thank you 30

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,899
good afternoon everybody I we're gonna
talk today about

16
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,860
undoing complexity and high security
locks I'm great turnout this afternoon

17
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,940
thanks for all common

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,280
I'm we were talking a little while ago
about how to start this off

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,110
and we thought we started off the way we
started off an 18-month Odyssey

20
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:20,140
research project that ended in the
release of a book last week

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,860
on cracking medical high-security locks
many have you this morning word John

22
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,250
King's lecture

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,950
on asthmatic order and this is a
continuation I

24
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,700
and so what we really thought we would
do about to start the

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,060
festivities this afternoon I'm we have
and let me introduce everybody this is

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,450
Tobias blues man s my co author

27
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,549
are our medical book I

28
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:48,420
toby is from Venezuela lives in Miami
and as a locksmith for

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,869
about what twenty years fifteen years
your steers to be

30
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:56,100
yeah is no longer working I and

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,650
and work for a medico art dealer for

32
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,670
about ten years and is intimately
familiar with medico

33
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,720
I had actually contacted me a

34
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,769
in my capacity as a lawyer a couple
years ago

35
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,669
on a decoder the the reinvented for
medical and we became

36
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:18,730
really close friends and embarked on our
research project this is Matt fiddler

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,999
we've lectured a number of times here
before

38
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:26,519
and so we're gonna talk about the real
world of high security and I'm doing

39
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:27,370
complexity

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,510
what we thought we would do is introduce
this

41
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,659
I'm we have some medical cylinders here
both profile from Europe

42
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:40,200
and US these are all six PN medical
locks they're all factory standard

43
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,359
this 16 actually is a the

44
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,840
profile so nurse from Europe for fiber
in the US for 6 p.m.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,109
I we've got a a deadbolt so under

46
00:02:51,109 --> 00:02:55,419
and we've got a mortise cylinder these
are both 6 p.m.

47
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,279
here we're opening these were bumping
now you have to keep in mind these are

48
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,639
bomb proof locks

49
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,120
I according to the manufacture we're
opening these with one

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,889
a4 keys that we derive from our research
little virtually open any

51
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:14,809
biaxial RM three cylinder in the world

52
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:20,359
that's non master key aide that lock is
open

53
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,809
now I what this this here's an

54
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:30,059
with everybody medical challenge us and
so there's nothing in these locks

55
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:35,879
I this is the same kinda lock that the
12-year-old girl opened at Def Con last

56
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,429
year when we spoke out there

57
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,689
this is a high-security medico cylinder

58
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:45,159
bombproof math and Toby has got

59
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:50,209
a profile so longer and while these guys
are opening those were gonna try to open

60
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:50,930
this one

61
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,930
and then or explain why it so difficult
and we thought we'd begin this way

62
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:05,549
this what's up

63
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,320
help her do this while

64
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,779
talk and then we'll explain why this so

65
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,950
that that's how this research project
began

66
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,050
I I had met with medico a

67
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,130
we used to be are really friendly basis
a long-term

68
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,280
I not anymore unfortunately

69
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm not really our desire but that's the
way it turned out

70
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,430
and so Toby and I embarked on an
18-month project

71
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,460
once we figured out that we could bump
open

72
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,690
America so under as we go through this
medico had a press release on August 4th

73
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,990
2006

74
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,010
after we introduce general into the
world at Def Con

75
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,190
I medical announcer locks were bomb
proof

76
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,360
I am not okay now

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,710
let me explain to you Toby just open
this lock normally we can do this

78
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,380
in about 15 seconds training

79
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,940
okay because I'm I'm a little bit
disappointed that's that's our normal

80
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,560
time

81
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,320
I the distinguishing feature how many
have you read John's lecture this

82
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:18,820
morning

83
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,790
okay good show good show up

84
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,630
this lock has four AR expand Senate
these are these are the AR expend so we

85
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,140
loaded the seas were supplied to us from

86
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,419
a senior representative medical I this
is a brand new profile so under

87
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,410
for AR expense one would be enough
there's 40 from

88
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,300
we can routinely open this we're not
saying we can open all of them

89
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,960
but if anyone in the security field or

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,669
that has security responsibility here
thinks that air expands our the

91
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,790
answer they're really not it's the

92
00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,390
and have the beginning rather than the
beginning of the end

93
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:05,510
and so they it is a problem it does not
solve all the problems

94
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,270
and so what we're gonna talk about today
is reality and high security locks in

95
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,049
complexity

96
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,520
Matt switches over I'm so it

97
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,270
as as Mark said we're gonna go through
some background will try not to

98
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,240
duplicate too much that john didn't come
through his talk

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,790
I bullets let's get to some mechanical
locks are typically

100
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,010
the for security fair barrier I as John
talked about and people ask questions

101
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,950
you know what what locks Ron Jon's house

102
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,200
I often they're the only security
barrier barrier

103
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,280
on and you have to ask yourself you know

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,320
what are you protecting I and what sort
of time axis

105
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,950
we should be considered to to have
protected an entity

106
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:48,070
I most locks to appear secure

107
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,860
as you look at these locks as you look
at the profiles of the key ways to them

108
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,169
they look very very difficult I but many
are not

109
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,669
I you have to understand the ratings
were gonna get into some the

110
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:03,200
you l 437 be hman and see ratings

111
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,650
and what those mean for high security
locks and I will dive into the layers

112
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,580
security I relieved the methodology by
which

113
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,710
we're able to go through and
systematically defeat these locks

114
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,690
I will talk about disclosure full
disclosure

115
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,870
on and you know the impact you the
manufacturers to the consumers

116
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,240
on the manufactures don't often no I and

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,979
often don't disclose these defects on

118
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:36,520
you know the question to you is is why
someone else just

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,000
open on I am why is this important well

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,200
many of you r are in it. and from

121
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,190
from an IT security perspective I'm it's
incumbent upon you to

122
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,900
protect your your information your your
server rooms

123
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,080
I so it's so it's important that

124
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,469
that you realize the risk posed with
certain locks

125
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,380
what the standards mean and what it
means 10 this is especially important

126
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,610
with high security locks because they
really are used for critical

127
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,539
infrastructure

128
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:08,530
I the White House Pentagon royal family
in the UK

129
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,289
I weapon systems these locks are relied
upon the keep people

130
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:16,479
out and so they have profound importance

131
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,680
and you really need to understand that
everything that glitters

132
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,479
may not be gold and I think it was side

133
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:27,310
Doug fair to say you know talked about
defense in depth multiple layers of

134
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,310
security but security clearly begins

135
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,549
with a lock I'm so for us

136
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,078
as researchers we find lakhs puzzles I
am

137
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:40,500
the more clout complex the more features
on the more difficult they are to open

138
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,760
I but with that comes from more
complexity comes more bucks more

139
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,819
vulnerabilities and more exposures for
us to uncover

140
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,160
I all them are apparently secure many
these

141
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,600
I thirty-year-olds designs

142
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,290
on to to our knowledge some %uh these
have never been discovered some these

143
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,300
vulnerabilities

144
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,250
and I my comment on that actually
medical was a forty-year-old design

145
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,180
it will it's the ostensibly the best in
the industry

146
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,990
and it took us a long time but we found

147
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,930
a design I won't call it a flaw it's a
design

148
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,010
issue that's a vulnerability that had
never been exploited be four

149
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,010
and we figured out there was twelve
steps so we went through to exploit this

150
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:24,600
lock

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,589
and we never thought we could do it we
actually shared all our results with the

152
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:29,200
company

153
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,500
every step of the way they never would
confirm or deny anything

154
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,290
so we just kept open in their locks and
Keifer and kept proceeding

155
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,819
and now of course it's a big problem so
the important thing is just because

156
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,260
everybody tells you it's secure

157
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,329
and there's patten's don't believe it
always look at it was skepticism there

158
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,380
so very good locks out there

159
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,790
I represent some lock manufacturers here
and in Europe

160
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,140
that make really really good locks and

161
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,829
you know we can't find the flaws but
that's not to say they're not there but

162
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,579
always view with skepticism next slide

163
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,300
it well and one last point II and the
last bullet is that you know of in

164
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,740
there's cops made to 2 Kos in
implementing these designs so

165
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:17,920
a very expensive what did block to
manufacture they may add at the last

166
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,280
minute implements I'm very inexpensive

167
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,800
components and often those are the ones
where it were able to exploit

168
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,270
right and it's not apparent at all

169
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,490
and and I make one other comment if you
if

170
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,100
probably many have you ever read it on
my blog we posted

171
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,470
two editorials about responsible
disclosure which will get a little while

172
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,670
but Medical has now recognized the lock
support community

173
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,599
and what John King D A the editorial the
way posts it it's not due to altruistic

174
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,959
motives they did it for a reason

175
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,900
the I work irony is that many of the
Loch sport enthusiasts and hackers and

176
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,959
IT professionals and security people

177
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:04,640
are the ones that have to find the bugs
that the manufacturers cannot find

178
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,040
and so it's been a long time coming Matt
my gave a lecture four years ago where

179
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,180
we proposed a joint partnership between
manufactures law enforcement

180
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,199
and the hacking in Loch sport community
nobody would buy into it so

181
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:23,579
it's coming of age and we need a lot of
diverse very clever people looking at

182
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,430
locks for vulnerabilities

183
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,220
its its the thing to do so you need to
understand the difference between

184
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,459
conventional on high security locks

185
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:36,290
I and what that means conventional
cylinders obviously our easy to pick

186
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,439
and pump open if you go down to the
village you'll see I

187
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,670
and and learn how to pick in and bump
open many many conventional Saunders

188
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:46,680
there's no key control so there's no
patents protecting the

189
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,560
the key there's no proprietary key ways
I or additional restrictions

190
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,250
I in a very limited forced entry yeah
conventional locks

191
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:59,880
are everything from quickset I'm to me
arguably the worst lock in America but

192
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,320
they sell 'em everywhere

193
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,829
this is what general and open two years
ago at the Afrikan

194
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:08,199
to the higher security lock with the
conventional locks are very limited

195
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:11,350
security capabilities and you need to
understand that

196
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,510
and so were differentiating I'm because

197
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,290
summer you folks in your job to select
high-security cylinders

198
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,640
and in many cases and and let me tell
you the next book

199
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,110
is about multi lock the first book was
about medical

200
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:31,890
they're not the only high security lock
on the block and lots of them have

201
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,180
problems

202
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,870
and so we're going to talk about so that
that the sanction you understand its

203
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,730
conventional walks can only go so far

204
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:45,690
in protecting you and they can be bomb
there's no key control to speak of

205
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,140
there's a lot of problems but they're
more more there is less expensive

206
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,149
so I threw up I'm on the screen is more
to cylinder this more cylinder and

207
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:57,440
I don't even make it out right on the
tip of my finger here is

208
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,220
I U L with the little circle around it
this is a you l 437 rated lock

209
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,930
and what that means is I there's high
high tolerance is to it there's

210
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,029
I resistance to forced entry there
certain security pins in it certain

211
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,980
hardened anti drill pins on in must
resist

212
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,920
forced and covert surreptitious entry
for a period of time

213
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,399
and risky control requirements against
that but as you can see we began this

214
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:23,640
presentation

215
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,860
I work pretty easily cop how's that
that's a couple seconds to Bob open now

216
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,920
again that's not all of them but

217
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,610
I and that particular lock which happens
to be a mortise owner we're going to

218
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,930
disclose next month a very serious issue

219
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,850
I'm that will allow that to be opened
very easily

220
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,610
0 go so I'm layers of security and in
this is

221
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,660
really critical to understand the layers
of security the layers

222
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,100
inherent in Medicago and how we're able
to expose

223
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,200
and tear down those layers much like you
wouldn't software and exploit them

224
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,790
I'm obviously each one is a separate
point of failure the add additional

225
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:04,130
complexity and with that comes
additional vulnerability

226
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,310
on we're gonna show some pictures here
up different at

227
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,560
layers of security or components
inherent within

228
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,720
high-security in conventional security
locks

229
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,490
sliders sidebars check pins there's a
whole host of additional components

230
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:22,070
that can be added to high-security
cylinders I to increased

231
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,860
their their resistance to attack

232
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,200
I so it go ahead art well

233
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,610
from an engineering standpoint when we
look at layers of security when we want

234
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,420
to attack a lock and when we started
with our project we sweet we looked at a

235
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,870
number parameters

236
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,140
and obviously we want to know how many
layers and the ability to exploit each

237
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,750
design feature

238
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,000
and if they're integrated layers of
security or are they separate

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,630
how they work in the Primus for example
there's two

240
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:56,920
independent layers of security I this is
the shins

241
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,130
conservator Saudi I'm there you go thank
you

242
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,170
I'm in this leg in this lake primus and

243
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:09,350
OSA locks there's separate layers of
security with the site bit mailing

244
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,740
their ego I'm so the key is very
different than medical

245
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,490
in medical everything the cuts are both
angled and vertical

246
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,470
in in one combined cut in the %ah saws
an app lawyers and some other locks

247
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,100
their separate functions we went through
a really detailed analysis when we

248
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,410
prepared our book

249
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:34,270
to tell everybody that different so you
understand the pluses and minuses

250
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,910
four different kinds of high security
locks so when we got in the medical

251
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,319
you'd understand what's good what's bad

252
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,380
okay so convention layers of security
there's really one

253
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,560
and and we don't need to dwell on the
slide but

254
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,390
I it's the sheer line and that's a a

255
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,750
that you can't do anymore with the
conventional pin tumbler lock

256
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,279
them maker sure line so you can put
mushroom when security tumblers like you

257
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,970
see on the left hand slide

258
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,209
the the green lock I that's a mushroom
p.m. to make picking more difficult

259
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:11,480
these locks that we've opened today by
bumping

260
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:16,220
all have at least two or three mushroom
pins in a

261
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:20,200
and so we've and and I might tell you
that

262
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:26,330
toby's best time at lockpicking up a
6-pin Medicus owners 27 seconds

263
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:31,589
mine is about they had two minutes but I
don't pick locks as much as Toby does

264
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,839
by bubble water but I don't pick up so
the the bottom line is on conventional

265
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,060
layers of security there's really just
one that you have to understand and

266
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,010
that's why they could be bumped open

267
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,439
now more layers of security these

268
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,800
5 pins on top or AR expands which we
just bombed open

269
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,420
the user medicos answer too high
high-security

270
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,750
and these as a point of history

271
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,019
were created about 1993 1994

272
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,829
in response to a very sophisticated
attack that came from Europe

273
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,819
using wire probes Sol these pains again
though

274
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:15,198
its jet it's another layer of security
but sorta but not exactly

275
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,390
the other layer security in the medical
m3 you see at the bottom which is the

276
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:20,199
step

277
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,300
on the side of the key it does not it's
listed in their patent is providing

278
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,639
another level of security

279
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,050
it does not a paperclip or a piece of
wire

280
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,230
that offsets a slider 40,000 seven-inch

281
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:36,600
its that layer of security is gonna

282
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,360
and here here's a I image of the
paperclip inserted

283
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,030
into the net medicare so under fire as
very high tech

284
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,178
now the paper clip doesn't open the lock
the paperclip

285
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:51,690
neutralizes that particular layer of
security

286
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,679
okay next slide

287
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,640
okay so again wire harness high-security
locks important to a lot are you folks

288
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,690
because

289
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,590
you have critical infrastructure that
means protecting

290
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,840
as assets people and you need

291
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,360
to rely on them us when you do not want

292
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,460
somebody that an hour that's the bottom
line

293
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,560
they can hack into your systems all they
want but if they can enter into your

294
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,649
server room

295
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:24,720
or your credit card room or your cache
folder whatever its over

296
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,700
and so high-security locks you specified
because

297
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,710
love the standards that you well and the
builders hardware manufacturers

298
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,429
association promulgate

299
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,520
because you don't have the ability to
test your own locks so they do it for

300
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:38,980
you

301
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,270
and publish standards the problem is is
as we work very well documented

302
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,490
the standards don't address all the
issues and that

303
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,740
really is a primary problem and less

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,290
you def unless you attack the lock the
way the standards address it

305
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:57,899
they won't even look at the method of
attack we broke the deadbolt

306
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:01,530
the medical deadbolt last year with the
two dollar screwdriver

307
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,050
we filed a complaint with you well they
wouldn't even address it they said

308
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,980
it's not in the standard don't talk to
us about it change the standard before

309
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,770
we look at the lock

310
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,080
and so it's a perfect catch-twenty two
next

311
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,678
okay so critical design issues again
there's multiple security layers the

312
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:19,870
question is

313
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:24,260
is there more than one point a failure
and this is really critical

314
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,350
because each security layer must be
independent

315
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,710
the security layers all operate in
parallel so if one fails you still can

316
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:33,860
open the lock

317
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,300
so when medicos case there's three
security layers in their latest

318
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,629
generation

319
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,669
we've neutralize two out of three pick
the third like a conventional pin

320
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:43,830
tumbler lock

321
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,590
or we neutralize all three next

322
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:53,379
three design factors the standards
require three design parameters for

323
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,470
high-security this is what you guys are

324
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,550
were I relying upon

325
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:02,668
and that's a resistance to force entry
their resistance to covert and

326
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,320
surreptitious entry

327
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,860
and their key control or as we prefer to
call it

328
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,080
he security and key security means you
can't knock off the blanks

329
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,300
you can't replicate the key issue can't
duplicate them

330
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,790
and you can't simulate I'm so when
you're handed the key

331
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,010
as an employee ever high-security
facility

332
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:27,080
the assumption is that you can't go down
to the local locksmith or hardware store

333
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,230
Home Depot

334
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,370
and duplicate that key well

335
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,250
that's a real problem so Matt bring up
the

336
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:40,710
this is a medico deadbolt so wonder
where the paperclip in it

337
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,310
and the simulated key that we show you
how to do for a dollar

338
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:48,850
this war bypass any medico

339
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:52,580
m3 keyway even the most restricted

340
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,750
key ways that you guys think our
proprietary restricted nobody can get

341
00:20:56,750 --> 00:21:00,000
our factory controlled don't believe it

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,510
the problem is there are layers of
complexity when they came out with this

343
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,929
lock in 2003

344
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,130
they white and that the key way by seven
thousands over the edge

345
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,890
what is seven thousands mean well not
much to you guys but it meant a lot to

346
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,660
us

347
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,850
because we get sticker little simulated
key and

348
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,040
and and actually duplicate a working key
like it's in that lock

349
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,470
and bypass every key way which means we
can make bump keys

350
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,070
we can make coat setting keys we can
make the actual key for the lock

351
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,280
no key control major major probs

352
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,260
as we know up the fastest way to open a
lock is obviously with the key

353
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,790
whether it's replicated simulated or
duplicated

354
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,100
now so so the slice pretty interesting
and and we give a talk time last year

355
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,120
or the year before on standards I'm you
ellen Beach MA

356
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,460
and we details and provide matrices that

357
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,710
that depict the time I the certain tools
that are required

358
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,480
I to you for that are accepted by the
standards

359
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,429
on sofort for forced entry I well for

360
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:09,230
covert entry it's 10 or 15 minutes
depending which standard

361
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,750
on but the to restrict the text tools
that can be used

362
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:16,230
so as Mark said the two dollar
screwdriver that was

363
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,480
I fashioned for the for the deadbolt
attack

364
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,380
was not considered to be acceptable
because it wasn't in the list tools

365
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,520
an annual does have a requirement that
all the criminal sign a form that they

366
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,840
will follow the

367
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,939
mandated to our requirements for
breaking in the locks

368
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,220
so that I guess you don't have to worry
about and in regards to bumping the

369
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:36,669
stick

370
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:39,780
the standards don't contemplate future
attacks

371
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,879
so as far as zero-day attacks they don't
exist in the standards perspective

372
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,520
its has to meet at matrix has to meet
two-time criteria

373
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,020
the certain tools and method by which
they they apply those

374
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,889
otherwise I it doesn't apply

375
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,900
okay so attack methodology here's what
you ought to come away with from the

376
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,309
standpoint

377
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,379
don't assume or believe anything

378
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:09,910
when a manufacture tells you they're
locks are bomb proof

379
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,299
don't believe it if their pic resistant
pic proof

380
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:19,910
take it with skepticism it's not that it
may not be true in certain instances

381
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:23,179
the problem is that a lot of
manufactures a lot a high-security

382
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:24,679
manufactures

383
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,980
cannot open their own locks

384
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,640
they may come they design um they all
want engineering school

385
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,840
they make things work really well and
reviews are very high tolerance locks

386
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,549
these are not

387
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:42,240
simple locks but they didn't grow up
breaking things

388
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,220
and that has to be an embedded thought
processes lots of you guys know

389
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,910
in order to be able to crack locks their
proposals

390
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:55,650
and they don't hire design engineers for
the most part

391
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,230
that know how to do this me here's the
theory

392
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,760
medico does not know how to bomb open
their own locks that's where this all

393
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,679
started

394
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,190
and it was suggested to some but their
senior technical people

395
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,240
watch the video of general and the
twelve-year-old

396
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,390
she figured out how to do it they
haven't

397
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,110
and this is the problem and it's what
everybody at risk

398
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,150
okay so here's here's really

399
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:25,380
our primary role the key never unlocks
the lock

400
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,770
and everybody says what does that mean
the key doesn't unlock the lock

401
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:34,690
the key actuates the mechanism that
controls the bold or lapsed

402
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,539
if you can get to that and circumvent
the actual internal locking mechanism

403
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,470
you're going to open the lock we call
that mechanical bypass

404
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,890
and bat is what we did in the medical
debt bold attack

405
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:52,919
that they had to urgently change the
design their locks not once but twice

406
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:56,620
and before they got it sort of right and
so

407
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,049
the lock never unlocks the lock and if
you can feel

408
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:04,490
any the internal components moving
against other internal components

409
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,890
you're going to open the lock eventually
and that was our first see Hobbs a

410
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,929
famous American locksmith a hundred and
fifty years ago

411
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:14,940
the figured out that program okay so

412
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,330
very quickly medico is the dominant high
security lock manufacturer in the US

413
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:21,610
they started forty years ago

414
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:26,309
they own they own seventy-plus percent
above the high security market

415
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:30,730
in this country they also sell all over
the world and mainly in the UK and

416
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,760
France

417
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,660
I South America and really there relied
upon

418
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,190
this is the price this is absolutely the
prize

419
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,160
that everybody's been trying to go after
because it presents such a problem the

420
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,570
covert entry teams

421
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:48,030
so that is one of the reasons we went
after it

422
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:51,070
I really it's because they told us we
couldn't do it

423
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,570
and and they were really were good
friends of mine

424
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,139
and they said you can't do this

425
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,410
okay so we went and did it and we kept
doing it and we kept getting more and

426
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,880
more sophisticated

427
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,610
but that the medical history from our
standpoint is only part of the issue

428
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,340
what you guys really need to be
concerned about is the methodology of

429
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,070
how

430
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,320
we did it and that's really what we
outline

431
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,830
its where we started and how we worked
our way through the problems because we

432
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,500
had the crack their codes

433
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,789
we had that we had to overcome a lot of
difficulties

434
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:29,379
with in order to come up with four key
so we're open all their locks

435
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,010
we had the crack their colds to figure
out how to make four keys to forty-six

436
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,100
thousand different

437
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,309
combinations and so we figured it out
because there were some

438
00:26:39,309 --> 00:26:42,918
there was all kinds a design issue so we
figured out how to exploit

439
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:48,210
so the bottom line is medico came out
with their original lock in 1970 their

440
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,730
second generation in a dev

441
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:55,610
about 85 call the biaxial the third and
current generation came out in 2003

442
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,440
which is called the m3

443
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,190
which has a little slider which we
bypassed with paperclip

444
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,940
in 2006 bumping was introduced to
America

445
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,380
I the announcer locks were bomb proof in
2007

446
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,650
it was revised to virtually bombproof
now

447
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:16,380
it's virtually resistant

448
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,799
and you know actually matt said we
should raffle of one other copies of my

449
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:22,580
book

450
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,559
you're somebody would really come up
with the best definition a virtually

451
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:27,910
resistant you get the book

452
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,289
and and our last slide will show you how
we're gonna do that

453
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:35,169
I so and by the way medical has made no
public statements

454
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:38,730
at all since we started this go

455
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,410
so deconstructing lessons have security
what did we learn from

456
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:46,630
this 18-month Odyssey I

457
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,220
we discovered serious vulnerabilities as
I said what we really learned in

458
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,289
confirmed is don't believe anything
anybody tells a

459
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:57,650
about high security locks and

460
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,860
there's serious potential security
issues

461
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,510
and it it really and a result of course

462
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,850
in us sitting down and really developing
how to do this

463
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,850
and writing about go or

464
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,330
so why is this important on you know as
we said the methodology the

465
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,870
the approach by which you can go ahead
and look at something that someone tells

466
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,450
you is is not possible is not doable

467
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,150
I'm clearly the appearance of security
versus the real world

468
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:30,809
I am medical claims that that these
locks are our bomb proof

469
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,049
ultimately changing several iterations

470
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:39,760
on their knowledge representations above
what these locks can do is

471
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,549
is critical to to how you assess these
many people rely on a manufacturers

472
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:45,270
claims

473
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:49,700
and again rely on those standards and
we're here to tell you that's that's not

474
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,690
true

475
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:54,150
I'm again we want to demonstrate our
methodology will go into the four

476
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,210
components have that

477
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,510
coming soon and is obviously advocating
sick more secure lock designs

478
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,570
on medical meet many many mistakes they
fail to listen

479
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,220
on we believe and as john I'm

480
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,220
spoke out this morning and when we
further talk about the air expands

481
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,360
that there's been embedded problems for
many many years

482
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,620
on the problems got compounded as we
said as additional features and

483
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,750
functionality

484
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:25,150
to extend patents in to increase
security in the locks were

485
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,320
added additional water abilities were
added as well

486
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,600
on the field to connect the dots that
they weren't able to duplicate

487
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,260
you know throughout this exercise over
the last 18 months they've been briefed

488
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,740
even notify they've been contacted
they've been proven provided all the

489
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,710
details

490
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,460
above our findings and they couldn't
connect the dots yeah

491
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,059
the and this is the best in the industry
honestly

492
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,990
and they're really good company but they
didn't listen it's Erica

493
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:54,320
its and they thought they knew
everything and they thought this was

494
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,439
impossible that we were crazy

495
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,850
and you know I kept on that may be a
separate incident but we're still open

496
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,620
your locks

497
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,580
okay so here's how but we always did
maintain our sense a humor throughout

498
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,620
this project

499
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,770
even if they didn't I medico invented
the twisting PN

500
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,690
it is a brilliant design it was one of
two that i think is the most innovative

501
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,880
in this century unlock design

502
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,929
and this is just a photograph a biaxial
key

503
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,520
showing the angled cuts and the the
cylinder the bottom

504
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,110
this is a video that we did on the
multimedia addition of our book

505
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:33,919
at shows how we set the side bar code
and the little red angles

506
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,190
core on the on a key next to it
correspond to how the their

507
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,919
angles are set to open the lock okay so
again

508
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:45,400
there's three layers of security in
america lock because it is high security

509
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,440
one is the sheer line two is the the
sidebar

510
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,710
which must be retracted and is
controlled by the angular cuts

511
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,020
on the peons and three is the slider and
as we showed although they claim in

512
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,740
their path the sliders a security layer

513
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,289
that's theoretically to through but it
can be bypassed with a piece a wire

514
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:09,129
40,000 since the course just happens to
be the normal paper clip

515
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:13,220
there's also a are expand so how do you
open a medical Lochiel if the plans

516
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:19,120
you rotate that means it worse a slider
and the lock opens very very simple

517
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,970
so this this is a cutaway that Toby
produced

518
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:26,299
we shot a macro ever this is a biaxial

519
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:31,370
I showing and zoom in on the channel's
man real quickly

520
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,480
okay so you can see number for the

521
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,820
lavender arrow is the channel in the
peons that actually john is probing with

522
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,000
his pack

523
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,279
and the the sidebar lake which is a
yellow a row number three

524
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,309
goes into that channel when they all go
into the channel

525
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,399
the plot the sidebar retract and the

526
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,090
blood can turn okay and and this

527
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,450
this PowerPoint to be available we don't
expect you to follow all over

528
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,690
but we use it really for lecturing and
you guys can have it

529
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,919
so and week we just need to say the
sidebar

530
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,740
is medico security so if you defeat the
sidebar you defeat the lock

531
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,100
and so that's really what we
concentrated on it was a very

532
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,990
complicated problem

533
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,169
if you guys like really intellectual
puzzles

534
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:25,409
that have real world security
implications your love what we've done

535
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:30,669
I we had the crack the sidebar and how
to get the side bar code

536
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:34,220
because we can walk up to a lock and
open it with no

537
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,230
prior intelligence we can't pick at we
can bump it

538
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,510
we can create a special coat setting key
for which we've applied

539
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:46,650
for several patents that one of these
four keys

540
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,340
well virtually open every medical lock
in the world

541
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,440
that's their favorite term so

542
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,169
thats thats the sidebar is their
security

543
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:01,390
and it's a 40-year-old design that
really has not been changed

544
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:04,779
in forty years and I gotta tell your for
one minute

545
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:08,490
when I went to medical as a lawyer to
talk to him about

546
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,169
hopis decoder that he had invented
before I met him

547
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:16,940
yeah I do like that and their senior
technical guy

548
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:21,510
looked at me we were having coffee at in
a row and a locksmith convention

549
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,900
any says you mean that crackpot

550
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:30,650
from Miami he doesn't know anything is
used a thirty year old technology have

551
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,100
wires to probe are locked keys in

552
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,279
we're not dealing with them and so any
you need to get all the toby is

553
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,279
his email addresses crackpot its
security dot or

554
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,279
I third yeah okay slide

555
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:52,010
okay so this is how up the plugin
sidebar these are all the pins are

556
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,110
aligned

557
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,669
and I think we gotta zoom in so there
you go okay

558
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:00,720
so this is what a medical lock book blog
looks like

559
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,940
that is capable of being open the pins
are all aligned its share line as you

560
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,840
can see

561
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,040
and all the gates are aligned with the
legs are the sidebar so the sidebar

562
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,929
is being questioned by one over thumbs
so that that blood can turn

563
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:17,299
next like this slide that is locked

564
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:20,799
the pins are up and down which would be
in the plug in the shell

565
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:25,830
and as you can see the the channels are
not aligned the pins are all twisted

566
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:29,359
so that this law cannot be open go ahead

567
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:33,060
I'm so again what we go through the the
different attacks on the exploit

568
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,199
vulnerabilities

569
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,730
I am reverse engineering is Mark spoke
about the details are on the book I'm

570
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:39,949
not trying to put the book although I am

571
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:45,668
I but I there's a lot of detail there we
don't have enough time to talk about how

572
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:49,668
the the side bar code enumeration in
codes and keys were created

573
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:52,850
on us we got here

574
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:57,009
I design enhancements for generations a
lock by action on m3 and their new

575
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,720
bilevel oxo again

576
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,510
and I'm and beating this to death but
the introduce introduction

577
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:07,060
up additional features and functionality
to add layers of security or 2x 10

578
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,759
packet

579
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,600
on patents are mexico's is largely a lot
of trouble and I might make one other

580
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,230
comment if any of you have integrated
their new

581
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:18,520
by a level lock which is they're cheap
and

582
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,770
medical clone that has a sidebar that
isn't one

583
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,350
I you need to really understand that the
implementation have

584
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:32,069
via level in an m3 system can lead to
the compromise if your entire facility

585
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:36,890
because there some design parameters
that we discuss we won't do it online

586
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:41,150
that compromise the security because
they can be visually decoded

587
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:44,930
with a little poor scope that we show
you how to do that in a video

588
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:49,770
and so the problem is every time you do
a new iteration of a lock

589
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:53,940
to extend your patents you can cause
yourself a lot of trouble next

590
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,170
okay so we exploited all the design
features we will

591
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:02,720
basically week codes the design the coat
regression how the geniuses

592
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,779
at medico in the nineteen eighties
figured out the coat progression all the

593
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,370
crypto boys

594
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,790
and the key building design tolerances

595
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:15,859
and all the keying real rules we took
all this data

596
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:19,690
we mixed it all together in our heads
and we figured out how to use it against

597
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,420
up

598
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:26,010
and we open their locks by designing
exploiting their best design features

599
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:31,560
next okay so the results of our product
project here's the payoff

600
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,980
go ahead so the payoff is the title the
book open in 30 seconds

601
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,980
on covert and surreptitious entry in

602
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,810
in as little as 30 seconds or four Tobi
27 seconds

603
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:46,089
of forced entry multiple techniques I am

604
00:36:46,089 --> 00:36:49,100
32nd some much less than that

605
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:52,810
I and and it does truly affect millions
and millions a LOX

606
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,500
and complete total ownage I love key
control

607
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,010
said a word on it and his work

608
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:03,730
he's from connecticut yet understand

609
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:06,900
alright so the this a picture before
code seven keys

610
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,319
these are the four keys to the kingdom
as we column and

611
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:14,480
and these will and you'll notice there's
a specific lack of code detail on these

612
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,350
keys

613
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:18,920
so you guys can take these images and
replicate them so easily

614
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,040
I'm these keys as I said well virtually
open every one other non master kit

615
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,920
Saunders

616
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,569
that were produced according to the
codebook there's one codebook worldwide

617
00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:32,630
pre December 2007

618
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,930
so if we demonstrated early in the
beginning the results the project

619
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,200
I'm with pumping we can rule reliably
bomb open

620
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,859
virtually all biaxial in three locks I
am

621
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:46,230
produced from monkeys on medical blanks
on

622
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,830
and simulated blank so do you have that
one you're with and that's really the

623
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,020
problem because we have the capability
creating any blank for any medical

624
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,770
m3 in lots a biaxial ox we don't have
any restrictions we can also go

625
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,200
extrapolate the top level master key

626
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,690
to own a system and in a restricted key
where proprietary cue a system

627
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:11,029
this is a big problem because if you've
got access to keys it's a primary

628
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:12,089
requirement

629
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:15,410
to crack the master key levels the top
level master

630
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,500
and as you all know if you have the TMK
you own the system

631
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,150
so the first rule is you have to be able
to get the blanks

632
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,319
okay and this is what America bump key
looks like it's a very complex key

633
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,109
you guys can come up here afterwards her
I think we got up we got a signing

634
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:34,779
in the back so we'll show you the locks
or gonna be the lockpicking village all

635
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:35,589
weekend

636
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:39,130
if you have any questions but this is
what the key looks like so

637
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,759
this was gentle and last year at Def Con
when

638
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:48,170
this little 12-year-old who had been
become a star at 11

639
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,350
she opened the medico cylinder several
times

640
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,870
at Def Con last year medical said no way

641
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:58,190
this is a phony lock this is a phony
demonstration

642
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,450
so we see all the locks an hour after we
did this

643
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:05,109
sent him to some forensic experts and
they validated

644
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:08,520
this was an off-the-shelf standard
locked opiate pain that

645
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,259
to medical codes no problem

646
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:16,170
so key control key key security as you
said a total compromise a key security

647
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:19,239
duplicate Rep you replicate simulate
keys

648
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,799
for at virtually all in threes in some
by execute waz

649
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:27,469
on restricted proprietary and we talked
about the widening of the m3 keyway

650
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:31,009
that allows us to to introduce on many
other

651
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:36,350
the keys or planks I we could produce
bump keys and codes and keys

652
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,640
so this is this is a critical picture
here and you can see in this

653
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,089
a in the cylinder the red line
indicating how we're able to you up

654
00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:49,130
wrote in breach that key way the
interesting thing about this picture is

655
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,569
the standards mandate

656
00:39:50,569 --> 00:39:54,830
parecen turkeys that anyways the words
crossed the center line at least twice

657
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,489
to the so you can't move a pick up and
down

658
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:01,109
and so we don't know how they're meeting
that standard we're addressing there

659
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,350
right now

660
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:06,430
but this key way we can stick are
simulated Blanken

661
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:10,370
no problem that works like a factory
original

662
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,170
okay and and this is a simulated blank
an m3 this is what our keys look like

663
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,850
when we simulate them it's a dollar
blank we go through all through this

664
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,770
piece a cake no problem and again even
with the

665
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,250
reduced with on the simulated blanket
still maintains the rotational angle

666
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:31,739
able to rotate the pens and open up the
block

667
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:35,100
looks coming around it

668
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,029
you're so is so we show that show the
the paperclip I had to explain this to

669
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,029
mark he had no clue who MacGyver was but
I am

670
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:46,219
this is a truly that the security of the
m3

671
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:49,310
who is MacGyver cook I'm

672
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:55,210
okay so picking I'm again in as little
as 27 seconds for 6 p.m. lock

673
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,469
arm this does not mean high security
standards now again this is not every

674
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:01,000
lock

675
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,049
these are very very good locks but

676
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:07,710
we can open up and we can pick
individual plans without upsetting other

677
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,290
plans

678
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,839
would basically figured out how to do
whatever we wanted with these locks

679
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:16,830
and the real problem that you folks

680
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,319
there's a vulnerability that we discuss
at length

681
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:23,600
that will affect every system

682
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:28,910
that house Mata ko where you have a
problem with an employee that may breach

683
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,529
the security within a secure area

684
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:35,750
they can take their office key and go
use it

685
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,009
to pick open another office and this is
a very

686
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:44,049
very serious vulnerability most attacks
come from within

687
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:47,839
i'd I work a lot of investigations its
from within

688
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,950
and so the ability once you're inside to
go open a rear access an area where you

689
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,259
don't have authority to be

690
00:41:54,259 --> 00:41:57,600
0 problem if you know how to pick locks
and this is not

691
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,830
a problem I can tell you that

692
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,330
Toby was recently at a facility a very
high security facility

693
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:10,540
took the director of securities change
key

694
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,160
went into from another office and opened
his in 35 seconds

695
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,779
now can he do that with every lock no
can I do that no

696
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:22,170
but it is a serious serious threat the
you all

697
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:25,430
need to understand and be educated about

698
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,000
so this is one of the the locks it was
using the video demonstrations

699
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,020
I in the book and CD and clearly Toby
spent way too much time cuz it's really

700
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,710
damaged

701
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,080
I

702
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,200
raining steel applies yeah I hope the
rating still applies

703
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,279
we've we picked medical locks with
standard X

704
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:49,580
nothin special no sophisticated decoders
nothin

705
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,980
we're just open up going so we talked
about the top level master key and

706
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,210
ownage was something else I had to
explain to mark by Tom its

707
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,160
total on each of the system and we can
determine the side bar code

708
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,069
I where multiple side bar codes are our
employees as Mark said use a change he

709
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:07,520
wants

710
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,680
from one facility on totally on the
system

711
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,069
of forced entry techniques a lot of
these I am aren't necessarily provided

712
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:19,430
in detail in the book they are available
on the government CD

713
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,160
I but we we have released information on

714
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,759
on the the phone abilities inherent with
the deadbolt I thirty second bypass

715
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:32,710
and there's multiple hybrid techniques
180 be developed was a reversed picking

716
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,750
technique

717
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,680
are more to some ramen interchangeable
core core locke says Mark described in

718
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:41,350
in a month we're going to be releasing a
very very serious vulnerability that

719
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:42,210
affects Miley

720
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,839
millions and millions and millions and
millions of locks and can be carried out

721
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:46,400
in about

722
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,880
ultimately in about 10 seconds so this
is the dead-ball

723
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,040
that we open with the two dollar
screwdriver in twenty-five cents where

724
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,339
the materials

725
00:43:55,339 --> 00:43:58,710
priceless priceless here I

726
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:03,450
I only with mastercard I this is a
mortise cylinder and this is what we're

727
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:05,339
gonna be talking about next month

728
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:09,799
and like I said ultimately about 10
seconds this lock is open

729
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:13,049
and so again patten's

730
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:16,380
here's why here's really the role
patents don't mean anything

731
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,799
the patent office does not issue a
patent based on security or insecurity

732
00:44:19,799 --> 00:44:20,949
have a lock

733
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,509
the issuer on on obviousness on utility

734
00:44:24,509 --> 00:44:28,109
and that hasn't been done before and so

735
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:31,100
it doesn't have anything to do with
security that's what the manufacturers

736
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,020
claim so you need to understand the
parent verses

737
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,650
actual security so forty years of
invincibility doesn't mean a lot for the

738
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:39,500
next like

739
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,560
saw let's talk a couple minutes and we
would

740
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,680
urge you to read the editorials about
responsible disclosure versus

741
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,710
what we call irresponsible
non-disclosure just

742
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:56,239
we think that the lock manufacturers all
of them the do high security locks

743
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,180
especially have a duty to tell you if
there's a problem

744
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,560
as a customer and as a locksmith and as
a dealer

745
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,520
it's your security it's not theirs so
we're really pushing this concept

746
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,710
and making an incumbent upon the
manufactured to tell you what the

747
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,739
problem is

748
00:45:13,739 --> 00:45:18,750
and to fix it so if medical release is
there a rx pins

749
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,940
in all of their locks what about the
millions have locks that are out there

750
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:26,500
that they knew about this problem since
1994

751
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,989
when they started selling a our
experience what about

752
00:45:29,989 --> 00:45:34,080
all those locks why didn't the White
they wait 15 years

753
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,870
honestly to fix the problem if in fact
they're gonna fix that which

754
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:42,380
is our information so we think there may
be responsible disclosure

755
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,040
on on your part if you find a flaw our
phone ability

756
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,529
in a new lock we don't think it has
anything to do with

757
00:45:49,529 --> 00:45:54,290
anything in lakhs their out there are
ready unless they're gonna go off pay

758
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:59,460
to fix up it doesn't help you to tell
the manufacture about the problem

759
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,980
if you've already got the locks
installed

760
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,920
so again we think they have a duty to
customer we covered it in a very

761
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,660
into very detailed editorial so we won't
do it now so we can take a couple

762
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,609
questions

763
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:19,120
and this is this is the last frontier
this is what I ever did to earlier

764
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,400
the last thing that we have to crack and
we're gonna use

765
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,170
maybe the Enigma code machine that do it
is the figure out what virtually

766
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,489
resistance security means now we think
it might take a couple years

767
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:35,029
to work our way through that because
unfortunately my brother lawyers were

768
00:46:35,029 --> 00:46:35,850
involved

769
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,839
in drafting this meaningless language so
if any of you have any suggestions

770
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:40,350
please

771
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,029
email us to questions when what and

772
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:48,969
and so we'd be glad to take some
questions for maybe six seven minutes

773
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:52,219
anybody have any questions

774
00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:59,219
thank you

775
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:27,160
up

776
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,618
my favorite locks I are I like Primus

777
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:35,029
I like ABLOY and I love ever

778
00:47:35,029 --> 00:47:38,359
MCS from Austria the magnetic code
system

779
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:42,259
we used it as V model in our book

780
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:47,839
because it is absolutely control if you
don't have the key to that lock your not

781
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,640
going to open it end of story there's
for embedded magnets

782
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,709
8 rotors two sidebars it took 10 years

783
00:47:54,709 --> 00:47:58,399
have joined engineering were two
universities in Australia make the lock

784
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,589
they're not available in America yet
we're working on it

785
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:05,538
they're a terrific block very exactly
virtually resist verse

786
00:48:05,539 --> 00:48:09,529
now they're now they're virtually
resistant but to answer your question

787
00:48:09,529 --> 00:48:12,749
for strong I don't know where medical
was gonna go with mechanical locks and I

788
00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:14,009
i really wanna stress

789
00:48:14,009 --> 00:48:17,900
I've always love their company I think
they got great technology but they did

790
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,410
not

791
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,170
listen and it's a forty-year-old lock I
don't know mechanically where they're

792
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,799
going frankly I don't or

793
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:27,519
any mechanical manufactures really going
two minutes go ahead

794
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,640
next question what obviously over the
past decade there has been a rise in

795
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,819
electronic access control systems

796
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:37,229
and I was wondering if in your hands if
your experience there's been

797
00:48:37,229 --> 00:48:41,440
if hardware mechanical systems have had
a decrease in importance

798
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,979
and how you think the industry will look
at another 20 years it's going to look

799
00:48:44,979 --> 00:48:45,900
really different

800
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,959
let me just address one thing and maybe
I could talk to offline

801
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:52,430
for most of these electronic access
control systems

802
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,538
there's mechanical Saunders as a bypass

803
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:58,869
because everybody's afraid of electronic
failure so what r you know what and

804
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,190
there's no water trail on the mechanical
locks

805
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:04,940
so what are you gaining it twenty years
it's gonna look a lot different

806
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:10,249
next I you mentioned that the rotating
pens as one of two

807
00:49:10,249 --> 00:49:13,709
above the greatest innovations in your
opinion what was the other one

808
00:49:13,709 --> 00:49:16,829
mas Hamilton the XO seven XO a tax on
I'm

809
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,880
okay thank great lock very last question

810
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,289
last question for those of us who

811
00:49:25,289 --> 00:49:29,739
acquired m3 cylinders before December
2007

812
00:49:29,739 --> 00:49:33,049
um would agree kim

813
00:49:33,049 --> 00:49:36,999
solve the problem at least in part

814
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:40,680
can you solve the problem is that your
question

815
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,529
right by reaching a if the code but
prior to December 07 yeah

816
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:48,249
well let me tell you first of all we can
crack their locks after December 07 it

817
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:49,940
just takes is a little more work

818
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:54,299
but not much its sixteen keys were we
will all that down with intelligence

819
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:55,099
gathering to

820
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:59,049
after two keys and so the problem has
not gone away

821
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:02,259
if they implement if you put a are
there's two answers within it

822
00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:05,390
body and they are experience and

823
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:08,589
we have a list have safe site barcodes

824
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:13,299
we've put out now they may violate
medicos rules

825
00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:18,410
but we can't open and so that we felt we
had a duty to do that

826
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:21,999
if medical window we did most
importantly do you know why you can't

827
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:22,459
open them

828
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:25,890
do I know what why you can't open those
ones Korea

829
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,058
yeah we know exactly why why is that

830
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:33,809
shit up yeah okay why is that Packers
because our code setting keys won't set

831
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:35,819
the proper side bar code we can become

832
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:40,400
but it it may take us more time rather
than walking up with the Kia picking up

833
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,150
thank you

834
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,390
yup thank you all very much will be
offline

835
00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:48,879
where are we riser
