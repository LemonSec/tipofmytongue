1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,750
something outside I was kinda weird
URL's

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,350
but that's just my personal opinion
regulations there's a ton of them

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:13,930
I am obviously everybody's

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,820
probably familiar with paper I'm
guessing there's a few these others that

5
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,880
do you guys have seen

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,599
everybody signed one other stupid
disclosure forms when they go into %uh

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,090
pick up their pharmaceuticals

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,840
legal pharmaceuticals

9
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,450
I

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,290
so real quick

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,580
problem didn't really exist about fifty
years ago

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:41,800
thereabouts I mean used to hide it
identity theft and people in the

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,470
wild wild west would no change the name
a couple times

14
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,629
but it wasn't widespread

15
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,830
obviously about to ten years ago

16
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,570
in the rush to make everything available
online

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,349
people forgot about privacy and sold
within the past 10 years they've kinda

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,630
try to figure out how the hell fix
everything

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,270
they broke so

20
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:14,899
um I found I kinda interesting 304

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,530
million people in the US and 227,000
disclosures

22
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:25,070
if I had to guess I'd say that probably

23
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,200
everybody in this audience with the
exception of maybe fifteen people

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,760
have had some sort of disclosure whether
that wet weather

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,320
they actually received a notice or not
are and

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,189
that's my favorite example right there
in the middle veterans eccentric cetera

27
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:44,939
so it happens to everybody

28
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,310
um a couple with the interesting

29
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,189
website six that are people that are out
there

30
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,820
exposing what idiots are out there
putting all this information on the

31
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,500
Internet

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,869
I in the politicians ex-senator the
Virginia watchdog is probably my

33
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:03,499
favorite

34
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:06,979
I'm she does pretty good work I'll

35
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,990
in fact being from florida

36
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,569
I found JW's brother jet

37
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:16,790
Jorge De Beers brother jet are former
governor

38
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,989
at your interested there's a social
security number minuto

39
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,310
his wife's on there too nice lady

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,760
Spanish I'm not gonna play this

41
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,750
because its long but basically $20
million records

42
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,819
and Riverside this is this this will be
in the

43
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,750
PowerPoint presentation you guys go
online and our

44
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,989
to receive stock down we've got this on
their

45
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,959
this whole presentation as well as the
movies at the end

46
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,810
movies the president

47
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,260
demonstration at the end are on there as
well so

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,329
okay

49
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:05,049
PI adjustments so this is the actual
anonymization

50
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:11,019
or tsunami is Asian portion are you got
two main

51
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:14,510
changes that you can make you either
have a random number

52
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:19,739
and anybody in here attend the Debian
deal a couple minutes ago

53
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,040
okay perfect example you screw up with
RNG

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,548
you screw up everything else so I

55
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,879
random numbers is far as the

56
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,879
random numbers go got the three

57
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,159
main at the top I obviously if you go
through and have a

58
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,429
lookup table you gotta trust whoever
owns the lookup table

59
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,439
and administrators aren't the only ones
that have access to that

60
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,819
not that anybody here whatever try to
break into a computer

61
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,870
but it does happen so the second one

62
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:00,019
is a some sort of mathematical function

63
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:03,939
some sort of the

64
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:07,420
mathematical function are replaces the
PIII

65
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:11,319
and we'll look at the different methods
of doing that a couple seconds

66
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,079
np-hard net medical functions anything
that you use to pretty much do

67
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:20,950
crypto would

68
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,120
okay um so

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,480
anonymization soon on a position

70
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,810
anonymization you can't put it back

71
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,500
your move it it's gone

72
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,700
there there's no way I'm reforming the

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,280
that the person that the information
came from a tsunami is Asian

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,420
you can go through and put it back I'm
gonna use anonymization for all love it

75
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,990
just please bear with me on the hotseat

76
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:54,470
normalization is kind of interesting if
you go through and

77
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,040
expect their Rob Bob

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,900
and Robert are all the same person that
this was something that was a problem in

79
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,210
Las Vegas when they were trying to catch
cheats

80
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,010
out there bob smith suddenly became
Robert Smith Nick couldn't figure that

81
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,110
out

82
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,580
the example if the into this has a

83
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,430
airline as an airline now watch list

84
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,380
that will go through and with those
particular people

85
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,900
I'm

86
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,280
are settings with those with those
people

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,070
obviously if bob smith tops on the plane
and and Roberts miss this is the one

88
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,099
that's on the watch list

89
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,930
you probably don't want him pop in on
board not that anybody would ever be

90
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,220
denied

91
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,370
entrance onto an airplane that's here

92
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:52,370
I let's see

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,940
UK I at the bottom there who has access
to the table

94
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,660
that's a pretty well known problem and I
think we'll talk about that

95
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,720
a couple seconds later but it's so well
known I'm not gonna cover basically

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,660
you you have to lock it up in some form
or fashion Google does that

97
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,020
as far as a who has access

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,960
to the data that they collect from
everybody that uses the Web Site

99
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,669
they have procedures in place so that
you can go back through nm

100
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,890
figure out who did a search on Jeb Bush

101
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,870
Virginia watchdog and Tampa or something
like that

102
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,850
so this is the actual

103
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:38,930
anonymization if you notice a

104
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,000
obviously social security number and
address dozer

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,660
direct identifiers you can find
theoretically anyone with just those

106
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,750
pieces of information when you start
going into the other is those great

107
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,000
portions

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,620
I you get into the hipper requirements
that we're talking about P II couple

109
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,430
seconds ago

110
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,250
and you can start putting people back
together

111
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm if you have enough for them so you
actually if you want to truly an honor

112
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,440
my eyes the data you're gonna

113
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,680
end up with the guys first name maybe

114
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,320
the state the reason think you'd even
have to skip his

115
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,080
age but anyways that's the anonymization
portion

116
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,580
so everything from now on is
anonymization whether it

117
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,340
removes everything or not will deal I

118
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,480
data replacement I let's see d
identification you can actually go

119
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,180
through

120
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,650
if you just use a straight RNG and start
replacing all the PI you can replace

121
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,400
everything

122
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
going back in actually trying to

123
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,590
reconstitute anything abuse or value I

124
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,380
is where you start getting into some
difficulties in particular

125
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,409
if you want to do like medical research

126
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,070
the company was founded by medical
doctor

127
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,469
so Canada natural hipper related

128
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,669
that's where most the stuff came from
you want your doctor to be able to go

129
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,789
through enough figure out that

130
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,820
you visited a couple different hospitals
you don't necessarily want to

131
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,200
have two different random numbers point
to you at those two different hospitals

132
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,570
it's the

133
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,690
again this is a straightforward as far
as

134
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,190
the replacements go the tables

135
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:37,110
what those down as best as possible so
hashing is where we get into the first

136
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,820
to the mathematical functions

137
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,410
I what I say about it

138
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,490
it's a hack cheats it's supposed to be a
one-way function

139
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,990
I obviously with some the collision
problems that we've had in the past

140
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,740
I if if you have that information it's
not necessarily going to be one way

141
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,770
and you can go through and serve
reconstituting especially if you have

142
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,230
something as simple as a nine digit
number arm

143
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,640
you can reconstitute that as far as a

144
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,500
hash collisions go so its

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,810
you example there you go

146
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,660
replacing them with math functions some
other popular ones there

147
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,719
are you start getting into the shop
functions and you've got a reasonable

148
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,410
expectation for good math there
encryption

149
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,860
I asymmetric versus metric I wanted to
talk about that for a reason

150
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,860
I'll so asymmetric you're going to do
about it

151
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,720
obviously the private key holder gets to
control who can see whatever data

152
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,820
I a couple other companies that actually
use the

153
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,650
PTI version on

154
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,140
it's it's that trade-off that

155
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,550
that that was the purpose this talk if
you've got

156
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,110
the hash function it's one way
theoretically you can go backwards

157
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,170
you using out private key

158
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,219
a public key crypto

159
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,630
the person that actually owns the day t
have to get the year

160
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:16,700
okay authorization from them and if
you're using the symmetric key crypto

161
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,970
others kinda trade of you you've got you
can either

162
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,140
have the in person using public key

163
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:29,130
kinda hybrid thing or have somebody
that's trusted like the government

164
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,459
picking go through and now

165
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:37,310
kinda say hey you know a warrant is
issued yada yada yada

166
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,020
I am that trusted third party is a
moderator that's where you start getting

167
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,130
into

168
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,180
who do you trust

169
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,910
its city

170
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,150
so one of the interesting things as far
as actor talk if he goes

171
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,610
it lease with our product if you were

172
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,100
if you have pointers for all these
things and go into that a little bit

173
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,660
more

174
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,350
that to a function can very easily
become one-way few

175
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,190
to lead the reverse pointer that's why I
was asking about the databases earlier

176
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:12,050
so for companies that

177
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,060
do this I custodian and sit there

178
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,270
cook custodia X and Savior very well
known over and

179
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:25,120
Europe in the EU this is a big problem
over there yada yada yada

180
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,460
I am we'll talk about that more in total
seconds

181
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,860
I safe here uses the hash and

182
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,560
symmetric crypto because they don't have
a slight wave

183
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,220
going one way versus to

184
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,069
norian and I were developed that there's
more detail if you guys download this

185
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:53,120
others more detail unfortunately with 55
minutes we're not going to get to the

186
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,149
other portion going through 75 slides

187
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,490
so you guys can download this if you
want a little more detail on how these

188
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,509
different companies

189
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,339
do their signals a shift so

190
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:09,589
data mining will concentrate on that
because earlier we talked about

191
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:14,360
table lookup pretty well understood what
the files down I

192
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,310
as far as replacement goes

193
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,629
will talk about hasher's descriptive the
whole reason this started

194
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:24,660
I said some conference in DC go figure

195
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,689
and a the guy did Nora

196
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:32,480
Steve Jobs type very energetic I mean
big guys got its

197
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,839
finger in a light socket on the time and
I P

198
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,980
he gave a keynote speech spoke with him

199
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,920
and a couple words my card for trustee
and say types

200
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,378
and they were mentioning that you would
never want to go

201
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,240
have go through a new script tiger feat
for

202
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,350
a one-way function because or do
something like this with

203
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,240
hashing one-way function tried skin

204
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,540
okay you would never want to

205
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,849
try to do something where you can
reconstitute the data because they have

206
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,850
a really big computers i think is what
they said

207
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,870
so all rights

208
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,050
so here's the actual problems so we we
mentioned

209
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,250
will mentioned evian thats

210
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,620
I collisions brute force key length

211
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,350
we talked about that a little earlier in
the day the antarctic the geyser

212
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,390
are mentioning that people are out there
using a thousand pities

213
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,230
and its there's no real you need I

214
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,290
our show the brute force a

215
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,390
statistics in just a second but I mean
it's it's

216
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,040
its decades if you're going to brute
force them there's gonna be another flaw

217
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,219
that you can find whether it's

218
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,250
porky choices week he's you should go
through and

219
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,899
blacklist all those keys his Wheaties
even without going through

220
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,140
other the Debian flawed but you should
just never use and we pull those out

221
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,660
trouble the other companies put them out
as well see

222
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,189
so

223
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,140
you've got the a broken hash functions
in the middle

224
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,360
they can go through and and you've got
that collision problem

225
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,420
soon as you have that fixed amount of
data you're kinda hose because the whole

226
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,450
purpose behind see donna is Asian

227
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,830
I is to go through and have you know

228
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,890
my social security number equal some
random each and every time that I'm

229
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,640
going through and using it

230
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,780
I so that's one of the reasons that you
cannot put

231
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,780
random numbers in there I'm

232
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,680
oh the GP you thing at the bottom

233
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,940
there was some study think it's at the
year the

234
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,030
the link is on the bottom there you can
read it but they

235
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,020
they went through and and a pre
calculating hash tables and there's

236
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,490
enough memory on

237
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,170
graphics processors that you can go
through put all these hashes and you

238
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:05,690
were

239
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,240
he into the cards memory and run through
the tables

240
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,730
very quickly have in order order one

241
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,970
search against them

242
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,190
and essentially find and fix known

243
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:25,310
quantity a time so here we go about
their bien

244
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:29,850
I I thought it was six years ago I guess
it was 2006 my apologies

245
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,050
I'll netscape had a SSL

246
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:38,680
good flaw once upon a time basically any
these are going to have some problem

247
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,680
relying on trip tho

248
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,820
with the week he's in there kinda
difficult

249
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,590
and hash functions we talked about that

250
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,560
you don't want XYZ you don't my social
security number 2.2

251
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,630
two different numbers especially within
the same

252
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:03,630
same record at defeats the whole purpose
have seen on a position

253
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,738
hardware security modules obviously
acrid

254
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:18,279
crypto modules if you have a flaw in
them you can go through break

255
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,379
anything that's actually pretty with
them he just sounds kind if

256
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,980
eliminate most to those issues see

257
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:33,259
Colby risk it though so if you have an
overflow in the crypto module

258
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,730
which theoretically those things have
been pretty well come Dover

259
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,670
but if you have a risk of if you have a
flaw in the crypto module you

260
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,889
you're kinda those I

261
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:49,679
Colby wise I mean you're releasing it to
use

262
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,769
and that was the whole point behind the
poultry

263
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:58,279
attack there's the brute force numbers

264
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,480
T

265
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,459
so for a military intelligence agency
with a 128 bit

266
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,860
he it says

267
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,610
infeasible so nation-states
theoretically can't brute force 128 I

268
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,980
would bump that up to 512 probably

269
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,049
but I mean he did

270
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:26,789
the numbers are there it's if you
actually have to go through and and

271
00:17:26,789 --> 00:17:27,429
start

272
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:30,710
doing that many calculations it's just
invisible

273
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,260
a let's see we keys

274
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,440
so another thing they can go through if
you are if you

275
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,460
go through and in have a limited number
of keys I've you're not doing proper

276
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,070
rotation eccentric cetera

277
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,899
you can go through it now handle a
statistical attack

278
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:52,970
and figure out want to what information
is actually there

279
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,010
either because speech patterns are
pretty well understood

280
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,230
or because I have

281
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,029
I mean there's just ways it going back
through in figuring out what information

282
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:06,210
was Ingrid

283
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,070
because it shows up consistently think
that's how we broke a

284
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:17,070
wanna ciphers during work were World War
two

285
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:26,399
speaking way too damn fast and I'm it
seemed medications so we get into

286
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:32,759
from hashes RNG incorporation

287
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,570
doesn't work I crypto you can go through
and and

288
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,529
get the phipps validation kinda criteria
validations theoretically bills will go

289
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:43,840
through and actually

290
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,289
make sure that you're implementing your
crypto properly

291
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:50,840
open SSL 13 that its

292
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,529
more or less secure obviously it's not
going to

293
00:18:54,529 --> 00:19:00,779
a work that well long-term because
there's always going to be some other

294
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:01,460
softwares

295
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,179
haha I key storage keep them in the HS
NC can't you can read them at a memory

296
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:08,729
somewhere

297
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:15,159
so the trusted third party for lookup
tables

298
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:18,879
um that's kinda wanna BC's behinds

299
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:23,339
some stuff that we do and unfortunately

300
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,369
the government's going to use them
they're going to do something somewhere

301
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:32,869
so it's kinda better to rain in at least
a little bit up front so that you know

302
00:19:32,869 --> 00:19:35,408
you guys can go through and find my
information

303
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:38,739
because they did something stupid so

304
00:19:38,739 --> 00:19:41,879
right now they're think they can be
using

305
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:45,009
lookup tables or or handing out watch
list since then

306
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:48,649
suddenly Mohammed ida hands per se nada

307
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:53,349
both get pulled over just because their
names you want one of the guys you don't

308
00:19:53,349 --> 00:19:54,089
want the other

309
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:59,279
see

310
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,099
okie rotation so if you aren't

311
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:06,139
pulling the keys frequently enough

312
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:09,869
that's where you get into that
statistical analysis attack

313
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:16,869
against the crypto C

314
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:31,409
pretty straight forward I hope

315
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,949
probably don't want me to read the rest
of it I alright

316
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,270
now getting to the demonstration which
is probably why must you guys are here

317
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,830
in order to do that and then have to do
a quick explanation its

318
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,429
how we do things but promise to keep it
quick

319
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,500
and then we'll get to the

320
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,070
airline passenger example because you
guys said

321
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,090
your more technically savvy been threats
to the world

322
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,620
okay

323
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,960
we go through ever

324
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,930
have a fast key server encrypt
everything in and dump it into a

325
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,750
database

326
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,170
so all the keys are in pretty other
pointers to the keys are in cryptid

327
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:20,260
and for something else the secret to
consult the data is encrypted

328
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,930
you know that's

329
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:27,230
the middle part that's important your go
figure

330
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,400
see create a file you create a key that
red line they're supposed to be 80

331
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,080
pointer

332
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,330
it's hot it's red its own cryptic your
scripted

333
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:44,169
you store it in cryptic EU store that
that's a

334
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,980
you've got a crypto module that you're
going to be working in there the only

335
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,170
thing that you store with the actual
data

336
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,890
is a the in pretty pointer you can go
through and reconstitute to see that in

337
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,610
a database tables and couple seconds

338
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,750
I you wanted the credit

339
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,260
you go through there's an authorization
step there's a

340
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,610
ACL surgery but against the who can
actually access the key pointers

341
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:15,090
%uh lookup uses push down the crypto
module

342
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,129
the trips everything goes happy when you
are

343
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:23,280
stop opening the file it only opens
limited amount of information

344
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,830
time so for Kate what's what version

345
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,070
about the site for what's

346
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,700
the okay

347
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,940
so anonymized data sets I all these work
because if

348
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,120
what we call that hidden link which is
that in cryptic key pointer

349
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,120
down at the bottom the red box okay we
do everything this metric keys

350
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,930
the hidden link is a key point
everything for 2 with a symmetric key

351
00:22:54,930 --> 00:23:01,930
the ACLs again said anything scale this
thing she's

352
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,510
see the ACL so this has some insider
threat

353
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:12,220
capabilities and protections that may or
may not be refused and you guys if

354
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,730
for AV actually run servers or anything
along those lines

355
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:23,390
but you don't want other people in
that's one way about taking arid

356
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,590
and then out because the Federation you
can do to your

357
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,070
hierarchies virki material and that
allows you to do

358
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:34,590
multi-domain probably the

359
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,230
not as important with the repair but

360
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:42,040
hey it's going to be interesting if you
want to keep my company confidential

361
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,300
information

362
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,870
you want to keep that often the public
website and you want sure

363
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,170
SEC typeof information you won all three
of those a different tiers

364
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:59,170
so if you don't get slapped with
lawsuits

365
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,380
like I said everything's done with the
RDBMS

366
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:06,790
we've got a deal that actually link
single punch a different

367
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,730
databases and authorized access

368
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,540
you can then go through and access the
protected data records

369
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:18,170
is that works and

370
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,930
you've got the it would missing
something point is it you've got the

371
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,300
alias right there that

372
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,050
that's that in link that secret key
pointer and as soon as you actually had

373
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,300
data that comes in up here are

374
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,570
you're gonna go through pull out all the
non sensitive data

375
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,189
the non PIII stuff that we talked about
earlier the first name

376
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,460
first three digits at the zip code
eccentric center

377
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,040
and then you will pull out the sensitive
stuff

378
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,370
send it over to stand on his Asian
server service

379
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,000
agent arm second the in-house

380
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,050
if you're trying to do this in-house if
you're trying to protect your

381
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:56,930
information

382
00:24:56,930 --> 00:25:01,310
directly if you're dealing with somebody
like

383
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,700
the airlines and they're dealing with
somebody like the

384
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,720
FBI DHS

385
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,010
the DHS or the Department of Justice can
actually hold that

386
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:18,640
be that third-party hold the keys
control

387
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,050
not allow warrantless

388
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,360
type searches at the bottom

389
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,650
you go through and you get that de su
Nam and with that soon am

390
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,860
of I'll show you exactly what that is in
the database tables

391
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm but it's a cryptid itself

392
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,810
actually doubly tripling predicted
Witcher

393
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:46,810
allows you a method of going through in
restoring everything after the fact

394
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:51,419
you put this evening back in with the
non sensitive data and then you can do

395
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,070
data searches against it if

396
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,270
if if you have to find I maybe somebody
in the

397
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:01,320
medical community somebody visits a
couple different hospitals

398
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,730
that's the example that thing here you
can look at it actually might look at it

399
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,080
to you

400
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,770
but to in the medical community if the
if somebody goes through to a couple

401
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,820
different hospitals

402
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,450
and they have are no typhoid ur

403
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,270
or you know people were the

404
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,170
second hospital you probably want to
know that

405
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:26,850
it's the same person going to second
hospital verses having

406
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:33,290
to people and certainly having an
outbreak medical information

407
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,620
that's what i was just talking about I
okay

408
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,530
radiation poisoning sorry wanna know if
it's the same person

409
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,720
you go through pull out all the

410
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,020
I protected information kinda blurry a
little bit

411
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,370
we're using crypto to do it it's hip
compliance

412
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:54,380
a shitty it show you the example for
this

413
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,790
in a sec and we'll go through both
simultaneously and for the

414
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:04,030
airline passengers actually yet do this

415
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,570
for the airline passengers you've got a
no fly list

416
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,770
and that's what we're talking about
earlier with the hashing you can go

417
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,190
through

418
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:16,120
yet the bomb I'll

419
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,890
you want to find out if the other guys
any of the other colors

420
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:24,530
I'm in this particular example we go
through

421
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:29,720
because a passport number is you need to
know the different countries

422
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:35,130
we go through in cash her combined the

423
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,140
country code and the actual

424
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,500
arm passport number you can

425
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,940
put 345 different towns within a
database together

426
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:51,510
to make the alias that will be in being
cryptic cetera et cetera

427
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,450
and then use all that to determine if

428
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,600
this guy has the bomber not
unfortunately

429
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,900
you can't do this directly because a vet

430
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,310
I like I said the EU as

431
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,419
it privacy is a fundamental fundamental

432
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,480
right over there unlike here where

433
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,320
we say you know if you're in the finance
space

434
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,439
hey you shouldn't disclose somebody's
bank number and if you're in the medical

435
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,150
space usage shouldn't

436
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,250
expose their social security number

437
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,570
over there you should its exposing good

438
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:35,320
kinda different viewpoint if we actually
tried to do something like this over

439
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,928
here

440
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,310
it probably bankrupt a couple different
companies and

441
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:46,310
Albert might be one of them now

442
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,640
so same thing you go through pull out
pieces of information including me a

443
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,380
passport number in the country code

444
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,560
any return the country code because
that's not actually have

445
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:03,560
that's not actually PR and then this
safe harbor is that the only reason that

446
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,970
US companies can actually do business
with

447
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,430
the European Union we kind of promise
that we're not going to I disclose the

448
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,180
information

449
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,310
as much as we can't promise and that was
a big problem

450
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,610
back about to 10 years ago fifteen years
ago with her

451
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:23,620
IBM some the multinational conglomerates

452
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:26,800
multinational companies they just had
too many

453
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,090
at they they weren't doing business well
enough because they couldn't share

454
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,270
information between

455
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,810
their company and France in a company in
Germany I'm

456
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,040
so they got everything straightened out
in the EU and met with the

457
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,850
data protection privacy directive and

458
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,470
now they're trying to get everything
straightened out with the US they can

459
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,800
have that in place now

460
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,150
and to see you USA forever is heavy

461
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,460
how they did

462
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,030
okay so the database will look sorta
like this

463
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,520
you've got to the different airlines
country code

464
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,100
passport number and we're gonna combine
those two

465
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,660
in the anonymization service I don't
know if you guys can see this at the end

466
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,310
or not

467
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:11,659
but that setting cryptic pointer

468
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,250
there's a lot on it and this is
essentially a ticket

469
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,770
a pointer to got to the key

470
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:26,770
bit actually everything's encrypt it
with

471
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:36,050
in its second see if I can

472
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:53,500
as is often the case the best laid plans
don't quite work out the way they're

473
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,260
supposed to

474
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,470
I guess this does not have the
resolution it

475
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,930
one would expect so we've got to
enunciation demoss here the first one

476
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:07,170
is the medical that we just talked about
a

477
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,440
these work they're actually going
through in

478
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,510
kinda creating random data on

479
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,610
if anybody wants to fool around with
them we can set that up

480
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:20,190
we've got these built into movies
already

481
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:25,100
and you get to hear my lovely voice for
a more than five minutes

482
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:32,100
a

483
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:39,100
they're going to generate some data

484
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,130
yeah

485
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,820
I the CPT and icd-9 codes that era

486
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,899
diagnosis and patient codes

487
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm diagnosis and treatment groups

488
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,320
those are out what the medical community
the researchers would actually want to

489
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:00,169
correlate against and to get the SSN
number which you said the peace that

490
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,240
we want to keep private would pull out
the SS and

491
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,210
now one other things that ends up
happening with the

492
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,030
with these row numbers that's kinda been
identifiers that you could theoretically

493
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,720
go through in a

494
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,780
work backwards

495
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,649
if you were to hack the trusted third
service

496
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,750
you could work that back into

497
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,590
the hands the end consumer

498
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,580
today a however you'd have to we're take
care of a couple different

499
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,290
locations in their defense in depth
thing kind of comes into play at that

500
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,889
point I

501
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,460
one other way around it is just to you
other person on the

502
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,750
the person that's actually generating
the data the hospital

503
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,840
would go through and to put random
numbers in there against the

504
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,750
incentive the room numbers in just
submit all a bit in order

505
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:57,460
with random random numbers in there so
we had within

506
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:04,460
Nana my eyes everything

507
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,178
wait about six seconds um will go
through at the very end to this and look

508
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:14,470
at the pointers themselves

509
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,059
that might make a make make this look a
little more sensible

510
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,160
but the straightforward it's in pretty

511
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,160
it's going to come out to consisting

512
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,460
key link because it's a block cipher and

513
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,450
there's the data

514
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,680
anonymizer just put to everything back
into the Rose it

515
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,230
we started out with and you should have
the diagnosis and treatment codes at the

516
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,770
end

517
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:48,440
and that submit to the

518
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:55,440
data center those are the people that
we're trusting with all this information

519
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:10,169
okay view submitted data so if you were
to go through and find a couple people

520
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:15,799
vector visited a couple locations

521
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,620
will grab these two 115 116 you've got a
treat me code and diagnosis codes are

522
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,379
these people

523
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:26,540
that this person came in on who knows if
those two separate occasions

524
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,840
at or not but you can go through

525
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,470
and figure out because they have the
same alias

526
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:37,840
you can figure out who they were and

527
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,070
if the CDC want to go through and and
finest to people that

528
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,190
been exposed to the radiation figure out
if it was one person or two

529
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:53,190
they can go through and say 115

530
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,140
reverse the identity grab a social
security number and continue on

531
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,230
the reason that all this works

532
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:10,569
is because a

533
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:13,920
other tables themselves so you've got a
a

534
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,990
a pointer into reverse pointer that re:
that are included in these

535
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,680
tables and you've got to

536
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,430
hashed SS and so that the third-party
services gonna need to know

537
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:29,960
win I am when somebody's already in the
table

538
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,710
see you end up story hasher these in
this particular case the social security

539
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:34,160
number

540
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,009
and the if new data comes in

541
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:41,359
you don't want to give a different alias
that kinda defeats the whole purpose

542
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,700
so you want to find out if person a in
person be went to

543
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,319
different hospitals or if it's person a
going to both hospitals

544
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:53,450
see you would go through in a use the
hash to

545
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,098
make that determination if it already
exists you are returned the

546
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:01,460
Hidden Leaf here

547
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,319
actually you end up returning the area
switches

548
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:08,960
down the river further if you look at
the

549
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,430
this in mind you've got key identify her
key surveyed in a fire that allows you

550
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:14,910
to

551
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:18,308
figure out who it is that it generated
the key

552
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,369
and I returned it and then

553
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:25,920
you get the people's at the and spits
Bay 64 encoding

554
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,749
and then here's a being cryptic pointer

555
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:36,749
its down at the bottom you've got to

556
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:41,880
you reverse lookups and within this

557
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,670
um this first one is the encrypted
Hidden Lake

558
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,509
and the whole point behind it is that
this is the reverse lookup

559
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:52,779
so I'll show you the pointers

560
00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:58,539
if you want a couple seconds are reverse
in leach

561
00:36:58,539 --> 00:37:05,329
and hidden link for the ever so that you
can find a key point here

562
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:12,329
back into this 16 area

563
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:21,380
this my make it a little of more
sensible when you have the data come in

564
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,049
I you you put the hash in place so that
you can actually find it again

565
00:37:26,049 --> 00:37:29,529
we talked about that you crips the have
the data

566
00:37:29,529 --> 00:37:32,949
and you have the whoops

567
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:36,509
forward and reverse pointer sir that's
what you're just saying

568
00:37:36,509 --> 00:37:40,759
at their right there in those a

569
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:44,140
allow you to go back and forth between
our between the tater

570
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,819
tables and actually recreate everything
if you this

571
00:37:47,819 --> 00:37:53,479
delete this second table you can go
through and now make this a one-way

572
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,099
function

573
00:37:54,099 --> 00:38:01,039
defeats the purpose know what I wanted
to show in here

574
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,880
I hope that nobody can actually read any
of this and that there's nothing

575
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,989
straightforward it there's nothing that
you can

576
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:13,939
discern from any of this information so
any questions

577
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:18,069
you want to see the airline when it's
more the same as far as

578
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:23,169
the the tables go yessir Anna

579
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:30,060
there to read

580
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,970
you you would actually Tom if your day

581
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:38,160
for implement this in a database it's
very easy to putting up front

582
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,399
on if you want to put it in after the
fact

583
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,160
you've got to put this extra pointer in
here you've got to put it

584
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,569
a pointer on the individualized just the
pointer because everything else you can

585
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,390
do is look up

586
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:58,390
from there yes ma'am

587
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,680
yes

588
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,680
there's a couple different choices you
can either have

589
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,799
like the IT department I'm sorry the

590
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,800
okay

591
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,299
who she I think she's asking who stores
the day come on earth

592
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:33,559
me play

593
00:39:33,559 --> 00:39:37,619
I understand it you have like the secret
to data and you have a hash the

594
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:41,420
had a and then from there you have your
pointers that connected to you or

595
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,220
something like that

596
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,780
but I love that is just a one to one
link so

597
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,349
I mean orbiting yes it's all in cryptid

598
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,849
but I mean ultimately the lake if you
could identify

599
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:58,240
person to their pointer I seem different
hospitals have like different pointers

600
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,430
that their story would

601
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,578
how was this useful different huh sorry

602
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:07,630
it's okay to different hospitals can be
given different pointers

603
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:11,150
if you're doing this is a third party
service

604
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,349
very few doing this for the greater good
you're going to have

605
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:19,730
you have to have a central service
because what ends up happening is you

606
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,900
have to have some way every associating

607
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:26,039
back into you know an alias

608
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,220
if I give your social security number it
has two point back to something I am

609
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,839
what you can do is give different
aliases

610
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:38,680
to different hospitals or different
insurance companies

611
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:45,680
and then anonymized just within that
particular application they cannot well

612
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,880
they can

613
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,390
okay if you give everybody the same
alias

614
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:56,538
you can data mining against that pointer
on in that's what would happen in like a

615
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:57,650
medical research

616
00:40:57,650 --> 00:41:01,089
and you can also do this on the fly I'm
you can go through it

617
00:41:01,089 --> 00:41:05,009
and in for specific application

618
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,950
you know a for this particular research
we're looking at cancer patients

619
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:14,349
you can give them one set of aliases
okay that's just specific to them

620
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:17,670
they can go through figure out who
they're interested in but they only get

621
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,220
a subset of the completely

622
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:23,059
if that makes sense like they get their
own

623
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:26,460
they get their own alias pointer so they
get all the data

624
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,119
they can actually figure out anything
outside like they can

625
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:37,119
conglomerate Bayer aggregate that with
some other person's day

626
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:47,890
okay there's two different ways are
looking at that ok can we

627
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,120
talk about it afterwards okay because
there was somebody else that hair

628
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:57,970
question as well

629
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:04,970
Rep

630
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,739
you can right that was that was one of
the risks with passion is you're going

631
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,019
to have a collision

632
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:15,660
you've got it you know what is social
security number

633
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,788
nine did

634
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:23,190
exactly Diamyd

635
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,130
yes

636
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,770
they're actually using it in the you

637
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:35,770
that and and yeah I agree

638
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:39,579
I completely agree and in in that's
actually a big problem

639
00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:42,960
on the IBM

640
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,710
example they're using it for like names
and things along those lines that nora

641
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,829
its first three non-obvious relational
extraction or something along those

642
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:54,310
lines

643
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:59,109
it goes through an actually have
normalize is everything

644
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,319
so Bob Robert and Rob all

645
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,619
point to the same person they were using
it for the casinos because for some odd

646
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:07,270
reason

647
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,550
people would like to come in there a
cheat

648
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:13,880
so inning when they hashed it you know

649
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,480
like the NSA guy said there's no way of
going backwards for

650
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,570
bites you he didn't say that but he said
that it's easier to do with crypto

651
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:26,320
so anything else

652
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,730
come on guys it all makes sense

653
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:35,530
your brain hurts

654
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,180
okay well um thank you if you guys want
to

655
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,930
this presentation which has a heckuva
lot more well

656
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:50,930
cool I don't know what the hell I just
pushed

657
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,070
you

658
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,349
you know on if you guys want this
presentation you can go to

659
00:43:57,349 --> 00:44:01,960
received a car and its era it smack dab
on the front just a

660
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,230
register for it and the whole

661
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:11,810
whole nine yards are on there

662
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,960
web guy promises me it works it

663
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,180
there's a

664
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,970
Erica if you are go through in put on
create an account

665
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:31,970
it or give you

666
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,599
to give you a found i founder your

667
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:47,440
a word yeah

668
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,170
well anyways there's a ton of %uh
there's that there's these presentations

669
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,309
there's the movies that actually go
along at the end and and now

670
00:44:56,309 --> 00:45:00,190
a couple of additional files one on the
Col du

671
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:03,539
on how it doesn't affect what we do

672
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:08,099
which I thought was company just from
simple standpoint that the world was

673
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:08,749
going to end

674
00:45:08,749 --> 00:45:12,109
you know February when all these keys
were being

675
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:17,400
swiped left to right because somebody
stole a laptop that was an irony

676
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,140
so we found out that I did a quick
diagnosis and

677
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,499
it didn't affect us was gonna pull but
said

678
00:45:26,499 --> 00:45:29,599
each

679
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,579
each okay a you end up with every piece
of information gets its own key

680
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,920
so in every key is unique

681
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,529
you throw out all the week keys just
because

682
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:48,269
we do that and now is so you have all
these unique he's you can go through it

683
00:45:48,269 --> 00:45:50,160
and you don't have to worry about with
me

684
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,640
I'm we have system he's there's a set up
a hundred

685
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:58,430
you can set that as high as you want you
set it to a thousand euro take those out

686
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,368
there is a key expiration on them

687
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:03,380
they're stored but they have a limited
amount of information

688
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:10,380
they can actually for biggest story you
go on to the next 100

689
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:21,820
when they access the information

690
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,660
vay authenticate themselves to the
system

691
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:32,319
yes and once they of indicate that can
be certificate based

692
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,990
I'm once the authenticate there's
actually ACLs against every single

693
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:42,400
key the keys are in cryptid you don't
have the ACLU don't get the symmetric

694
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,520
key shift down to your crypto module

695
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:51,520
you can t crypt the the day yes sir

696
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:00,440
yes you can go through and in said a

697
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,910
said NaCl group and when you do that you
can

698
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:09,960
mom you get group controls well

699
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,940
right the the keys or encrypt it so
therefore you've gotta get

700
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,470
authentication to get the key to d crypt
the pointer to get there

701
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:20,890
on it on to actually make it all the way
down to the data

702
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,400
so it's a few at 8th

703
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,020
we can

704
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,410
talk more about that if you want you can
get kinda

705
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:35,598
involved yessir somebody gets

706
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,619
system so

707
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:42,569
say his

708
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,750
great for where

709
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,250
you route now because all that store
there's encrypt it

710
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,260
keys the database only has increased the
keys in

711
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,860
there's a key server that separate

712
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,370
in all it has on it is the ACL

713
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:06,430
access to key to the key David's so
you've got to separate pieces

714
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:10,910
you don't have here

715
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,170
in at in admin does not have decreased
rights

716
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,670
where is a user does

717
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,820
that there's ways if a setting up the

718
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,970
provisions in control civet you can go
through

719
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,560
at privileges eccentric cetera you can
get de kruif

720
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,250
rights to actually go through and grab
the keys the key server

721
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:36,320
just keep search tools very the
differences

722
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,570
so uses about D crib Shin

723
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:42,940
itself use well yes so that he's

724
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:46,680
stores yes yes on the key database or in
the crib too much

725
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,440
and so we're

726
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,350
works is that those services

727
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,810
there are moving from master keys on

728
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:02,490
the key server a game that's how you
start the key server up you can

729
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:05,700
do it with the groundfish que vem you
can do

730
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:12,700
multimedia a multi KeePass smart card
multi smart card start up for the system

731
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,660
see gotta if it reboots you know you can
have multiple

732
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,040
multiple people authenticate to it in
order to start the actual key service

733
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:26,620
so what you're asking

734
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:31,120
yes the key server key database in the
end work stations are all separate

735
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,640
machine servers so you've got separation

736
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:38,240
from that standpoint and I mean even if
you put these on

737
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,070
a file server if you put all the files
on a file server

738
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,690
the only pieces of information that are
stored are encrypted key pointer

739
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,140
which we call the Hidden Lake and the
encrypt the data

740
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:54,040
before it

741
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,339
if

742
00:49:56,339 --> 00:50:00,160
so were

743
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,440
is

744
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,470
its

745
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:08,250
books you you

746
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:13,790
the user side

747
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,440
can't you he's

748
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,130
for key database has increased to key
points that's correct okay

749
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:30,130
or up

750
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,420
strip

751
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:36,910
now it's cool go for it a

752
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:43,609
might have a picture might be easier to
work up the picture

753
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:46,979
there's 12 in the end work stations okay
there's three

754
00:50:46,979 --> 00:50:53,979
there's three parts

755
00:50:57,069 --> 00:50:58,560
its

756
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,328
this

757
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:03,089
we might want it there's

758
00:51:03,089 --> 00:51:06,409
his updated

759
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:11,380
or please good

760
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,779
right group to pick up tips for good
also

761
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:18,090
that you

762
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,740
inflated

763
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,380
table

764
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:27,460
but sit let's you and i sat there his
fifth

765
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:34,460
this that they can take more than five
minutes subsequent

766
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:39,230
if if if you crash well if you crash the

767
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,830
key server gate yes you will have an
issue

768
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:46,540
however you can federated scale you can
either

769
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:50,440
regionalized the key servers and have
trust relationship between

770
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,230
and you can put them like behind the
load balancer

771
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,000
and double not triple mob whatever just
add them had

772
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,380
had no answers

773
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,160
okay also is the best software you have

774
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,170
what your hospitals needle good

775
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:13,700
that that would be one of the reasons
that you do trust

776
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:17,540
and have a regional a regional database
regional key server

777
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,960
world so being

778
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,579
that me if physically in the hospital

779
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,920

here

787
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,460
good

788
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:09,210
review

789
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:10,730
you

790
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,290
real with right

791
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:16,650
here yes

792
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,839
is som good

793
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:24,470
are the the you actually

794
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:28,009
remember a couple seconds ago we saw to
the

795
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:31,420
the information that's actually sent row
ID number

796
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,599
and a social security number once thats

797
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:37,759
anonymized packets sent back to the

798
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:43,210
int the the ends database that's that

799
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,529
that you then replace or social security
numbers with the area's

800
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:51,990
re the original database yes sir he

801
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:56,200
said

802
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:03,200
the said

803
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:08,099
no never at

804
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:15,099
E on head

805
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,069
absolutely and what didn't work what
actually you can

806
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:23,799
give that day to you could even put that
server in China

807
00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:27,640
not that I'd recommend that but you
could put it in China and

808
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,359
and and they can mine against the data
I'll without any risk of compromise

809
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:33,019
because

810
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:36,829
the essence don't exist anywhere within
the dataset

811
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:41,130
or or whatever PI you want to put in
there doesn't exist within the date sir

812
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:47,300
his growth for wanted

813
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,890
day

814
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:55,310
or will 1

815
00:54:55,310 --> 00:54:59,440
your

816
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,470
um you keystroke loggers

817
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:06,170
probably going to be a a better-known

818
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:09,530
problem and you use you know

819
00:55:09,530 --> 00:55:13,760
anti-spyware things your I mean then
you're getting into something that we

820
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,860
really can't control

821
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:21,860
fortune said

822
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,330
good

823
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,609
the morning

824
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:28,620
he yes

825
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,980
you would

826
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:35,480
minds the that's absolutely correct

827
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,119
your feel yet

828
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,850
that's absolutely correct and in 10 the
one of the applications has been out

829
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:48,118
no we have a customer that a very large
customer

830
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:51,660
that uses for their customs control

831
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:54,830
so when a when somebody comes into the
country

832
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:58,930
you obviously don't want to you know
everybody and their brother

833
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,369
figure out that you went into that
particular

834
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:07,610
cheated so the the anonymized the
information stored securely in

835
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:10,970
the as far as the data races go there's
an incredible

836
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:14,710
essentially you're doing any critique
ripped call we've gotten

837
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:18,450
server server agents that run against
multiple databases

838
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:22,420
so you know whatever you using you just
make a call

839
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:29,420
you like maybe I'm how the hell do I
keep doing it

840
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,390
of side

841
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:36,720
alright you and you will probably need
to talk afterwards

842
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,740
if you feel up to it anything else thank
you

843
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:47,069
good thank you everybody for for coming
in tolerating my

844
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:54,069
rambling and over

845
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:58,940
with you to go site for someone to step
down

846
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,640
I guess a you hear my voice drone on for
a few minutes

847
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,710
what it actually makes here soon
probably

848
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:09,859
Iran you

849
00:57:09,859 --> 00:57:15,869
yep

850
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:22,869
now

851
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,790
I'm

852
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:27,200
sure

853
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,319
so

854
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,200
no

855
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,130
what one more thing I brought a couple
of orders if anybody wants there
