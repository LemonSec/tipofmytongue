1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,020
DVD's have all the talks here at The
Last Hope are on sale right outside the

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,940
vendor area here on the eighteenth floor

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,830
um and if you have a talk similar to
relationship packing run another sort of

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,429
screwball topic or something very
serious that you wanna talk about

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,670
um go ahead and sign up for the fourth
track and you so there's still a lot of

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,840
open slots left

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,740
um this is this room is so packed

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,100
it's never this pact on a Friday I'm I
probably shouldn't say this but I'm kind

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,610
of afraid it was gonna happen on
Saturday and Sunday when

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,010
you know the people with a job show up
iron

11
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,230
hands

12
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,290
okay it looks like mitch is getting
ready to go I

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,430
it is is my distinct honor and privilege

14
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,720
aren't introduced which basically
anything

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,940
image is heavily involved obviously
microcontrollers TV B Gone spraying

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,730
machines

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,470
I'm he's involved in the hackerspace
effort that's going on in San Francisco

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,870
right now in Noisebridge

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,270
um you have an awesome resume

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,550
and I love your hair gift-giving round
of applause just for his hair

21
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:12,550
but see

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,440
meet I'm not

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,640
I can keep throwing compliments up here
you know first give me one sector I

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,100
tell windows what supposed to do rather
that that's kind of a futile effort is

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,440
needed.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,210
his but

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,780
way you know why like well I'm here in
the wearing my hackerspace

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,380
village logo if you're interested
obviously if you're here you're

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,960
interested microcontrollers your
citizens I please

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,860
come check out the microcontroller
workshop going on in actresses village

31
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,900
we also have right next to the
microcontroller workshops circuit

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,330
bending severe just didn't

33
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,170
making all the electronic things make
noise in ways that they're not supposed

34
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,530
to make noise check that out

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,950
also we have alive video feed it to the
medal at in Austria right now

36
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,560
of on in I know some of you know about
the middle at know that they have this

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,369
really awesome phone booth in right now
on there's a Dell seen conference going

38
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,460
on at the metal out

39
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,689
Indiana right now and is one of the
items that conference people are

40
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:11,769
controlling

41
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,219
a little car that has a webcam on tits
roaming all around the hackerspace

42
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,108
village

43
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:19,049
and so that you know people are seeing
the look out the bounce in the people

44
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,400
things like that it's being controlled
from Vienna

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,419
and right now they're working on making
a live link so that people here can

46
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:26,189
communicate to the medal at

47
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:29,950
in Austria right now that's all going on
ackerson space village

48
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,629
on the factory just showed up they've
got a lot of school stuff going on NYC

49
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:34,399
resistor

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,419
is on the right and also at two o'clock
um

51
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:41,129
hackers Mart is opening up in the
hackerspace village if you have

52
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:44,939
any sort of need for LED's components
solder

53
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:47,319
other things like that work there's
things that you need if there's a

54
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,819
charter that you can't find

55
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,809
if there's other things you'd like we
actually around the clock for going out

56
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:55,669
and sourcing these things in new york
city so that you don't have to leave the

57
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:56,349
conference

58
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,590
we'll get it free and bring it right
here actually i

59
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,109
you know I know some certainty to get
around because the people are

60
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:07,069
out in New York City during khane
finding chargers and stuff for you guys

61
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:08,689
for the PC

62
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,799
I think that's also why I'm not gonna
cut it anymore

63
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,209
which is time with is my great honor and
privilege centuries two guys

64
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:19,459
miss almon give her huge round of
applause right now

65
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:26,459
analyst everyone

66
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,659
I hope a someone's you at least got more
sleep than the last night

67
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,309
I'm envious a few arm so I

68
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:37,329
a started this company currently
électronique support of my

69
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:42,169
one and only product TV B Gone I didn't
plan on running a business I'm not a

70
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:43,239
businessman but

71
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,529
the the world is a weird place so from

72
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:50,120
I put together this

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,919
workshop and the salk good to try to
give people

74
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,579
a hardware bug I yeah I think that

75
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,299
it's really great to be able to build
cool things

76
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:04,769
and I can

77
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,459
teach anyone to build cool things I've
taught thousands of people just with

78
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:10,959
this workshop that I've been doing

79
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,989
and this includes people who've never
even like

80
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,930
sewing a button or are soldered ever
before so if you're interested in

81
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,250
now learning or want to continue what
you've already learned feel free to come

82
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,240
to my workshop

83
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,020
now got lots of cider irons I can teach
outsider if you need to give your

84
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,020
freshers

85
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,190
on their lots of parts and I'm only
charging

86
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:36,940
just slightly more than what I pay just
like an break even for coming out here

87
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,000
so I just wanna pass along our

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,870
what I think is just a really cool thing
to do which is to play with hardware

89
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,960
and you know not be stuck with the
corporate crap

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,280
we would only have available otherwise

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,080
arm so I have some ideas what coal
projects are here's here's a few that

92
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,710
I think recall arm TV gone in a few
variations

93
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,810
a the last talk goes more infill

94
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:09,030
I worked out TV got kid with with her
and that turns of TV's

95
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,220
pretty far away like you know her 50 to
200 feet

96
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,010
the TV gone pro I just released turns me
off at a hundred years

97
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,159
it's kinda nice I i the I couldn't
resist some even though it is the hotel

98
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,070
Pennsylvania

99
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,250
I turned off all their CNN TV's
yesterday with the push one button

100
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,600
today they didn't work I'm skis in your
manual

101
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,850
said that they actually put table for
all the sensors

102
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,070
and I'm also sorry to say that the TVs
in the elevators are not remotely

103
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,130
control

104
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,710
from I'm tempted to hurt them but it's
the hotel Pennsylvania and we don't want

105
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,260
them

106
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,960
for me area so anyway cya I

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,880
helped a whole bunch love projects from
the Moors

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,540
many POV kid help you in this case
stands for persistence a vision that our

109
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,630
eyes

110
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,100
on make sense of the world a little busy
information sticks in her eyes in our

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,000
brains

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,720
after its gone

113
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,860
and if this kid here you can see it with
all this

114
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,500
light but you waited back and forth and
whatever you program it in with this

115
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,870
program in Port

116
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:22,620
arm you see pictures or words what every
program in it through this

117
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,580
the sea wave it through and it's a
really wonderful

118
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,159
sheep little kit that anyone can bill
designed for beginners and I thought it

119
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
would be really cool to

120
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,380
hackett to do budget from projects so
here's a few other projects that I did

121
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,880
not be talking a little about the moral
in the stock

122
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,190
also have parts to build all along
workshop arm

123
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,750
answers messing so i've a new project I
worked out with my friend Ralph

124
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,660
we are part of a San Francisco
microcontroller club

125
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,320
and on kinda am kinda interesting here
in our

126
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,990
21st century that there are a whole
bunch of geeks in big cities that get

127
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,430
together and form clubs

128
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,720
about microcontrollers and now the
meetings are a pretty big

129
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,220
so

130
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,000
the of here's the thing its a.m.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,590
a reset it and

132
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,060
if

133
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,080
so it has a up a library you can hack it

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,450
and it has a sound library have visuals
library

135
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,560
this one's kinda like pac-man the movie
the red one around

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,440
and try to get the green before the
yellow eats you

137
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,910
and as for levels its chemical

138
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,520
okay so is about microcontroller so

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,909
what is a microcontroller well it's a
complete

140
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,139
computer on a little chip it's not quite
as powerful as

141
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,490
like modern PCs or our Mac hardware but

142
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,680
it's really powerful and really cheap

143
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,350
so it's pretty much exactly the same as
any other one but it's on one ship in

144
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,750
there's

145
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,820
often of a little bit of extra hardware

146
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,460
so and most ones that are available now
like the ones on the many POV are all

147
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,780
these things here

148
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,710
um their hard work timers in it on
mention a little bit more about that

149
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,570
later there's also

150
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,080
input and output pins you can control

151
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,979
with the software and the software for
um microcontrollers

152
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,320
it's called firmware it's not quite

153
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,979
software cuz its you know it's directly

154
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,809
twiddling with the hardware but it's not
hardware so it's in the middle so it's

155
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:41,039
for

156
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,870
um what is a microcontroller too well it
does absolutely the exactly the same

157
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,029
thing that all computers do whether it's
super computers or

158
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,769
a PCs or Macs her or microcontrollers

159
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,930
they fetish instructions from program
memory

160
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,559
and execute them that's all to us that's
the next instruction

161
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,290
executed section X instruction executed
does that forever until you turn off

162
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,649
power

163
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:13,339
um so how do you make cool things with
my controllers

164
00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:16,699
arm offers you have to have an idea of
what to make

165
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:19,800
and then there's hardware and urs
firmware

166
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,379
and you don't have to do it in nestle in
any order and down

167
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,639
then the you just the make

168
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:33,089
something cool so

169
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:37,029
in software most people %uh go to catch
hacker conference is

170
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:41,509
know something about software I anyone
has done softer knows that one is off

171
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,999
things you have to do it beginning is to
you do a hello world

172
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:49,970
so if you can have your development
environment on your computer's

173
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,519
print hello world on the screen you can
do just about anything

174
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:59,879
or the equivalent to fan out for
microcontrollers is to make an LED blink

175
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,529
you can do %uh make an LED blink you can
do anything

176
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,759
really so

177
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,699
first call also you know that was the
idea and here's some hardware to do that

178
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,699
well this is a schematic now

179
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,149
you don't need to read be able to read a
schematic to do cool things with

180
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:19,629
microcontrollers but i wanna

181
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:23,829
teacher just a little bit about to a
hardware electronics here

182
00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:27,059
you know what's going on in the
background your hackers were inquiring

183
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,110
minds we want it now

184
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,519
so um that big box set in the middle
that's the microcontroller

185
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,680
representation and down for a little

186
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,699
a circle on the top next to the pus
battery the

187
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:43,970
the three lines at the bottom text the
minus term low battery

188
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,329
the zigzag that's a resistor and

189
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:52,499
that weird thing

190
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:56,240
that's an LED light emitting diode I'm
gonna mention just a bit here

191
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,689
by taking a little digression and
teacher just very very little bit about

192
00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:04,629
electronics electronics is dealing with
electrons

193
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:09,610
thats why its electronics so it can be
analogous in many ways

194
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,730
to water flowing through a pipe

195
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,300
so it's not what its ruling so flowing
through a pipe it's actually electrons

196
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,680
flowing through wires in parts

197
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,100
arm and there's this notion of current
that's one of the main things

198
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,420
and electronics and thats electrons
flowing

199
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,599
the faster the electrons flow the higher
the current and the unit iv:

200
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,749
that is amps and then a battery

201
00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:38,449
is like a pump pushing the electrons the
more it pushes the faster the current

202
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:39,309
goes

203
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:43,480
and um the the more the current and
thats bolts

204
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,499
and then resistors is kinda like a kink
in the pipe and they'll slow the flow

205
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,790
down

206
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:54,149
and the measurement that is homes and
there's a simple relationship with all

207
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,949
these witches ohms law

208
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:59,079
and like I said you don't need to know
all this but you can see that there is a

209
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:01,420
relationship if there's a King can also
down the current

210
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,628
the car battery it makes faster arm

211
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:09,910
and there's also a relationship with up
our how fast the battery will wear down

212
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,519
with all them as well so I diode is a
one-way valve

213
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,309
electrons only go one way through a
diode an LED light emitting diode when

214
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:19,980
the

215
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,970
valve elections are going they'll
correct way through the diode

216
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,089
it emits photons and you make all sorts
of

217
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:31,610
lights like these and the transistor is
one other part

218
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,730
arm it's like a remote

219
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,629
switch you put it teeny little we've got
three terminals you put a little bit a

220
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,579
current on the middle terminal

221
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:45,980
and it allows a large amount a current
flow from the top to the bottom line

222
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,199
and that's in the digital world we use
them as switches

223
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,249
so either turn the large money turn on
or off

224
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:56,480
and a microcontroller is nothing but a
bazillion

225
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,670
transistors set up in a bunch way so we
can

226
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,839
do sequences switching sign of

227
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,089
okay so that's your very basic
electronics

228
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:10,990
arm firmware really is

229
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,809
very much like software arm

230
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,079
so if you're familiar with suffered all
one other things you can do with

231
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,089
software is make a variable that can be
set to any value like

232
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:26,540
and that's exactly the same infirm where
so we have a variable

233
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,910
X we can make it be one

234
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,969
one thing though it from where it is
it's your

235
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,970
try to think about the hardware while
you're doing it on like with software

236
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,699
so with most microcontrollers their 8
its

237
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:45,350
so the physical memory actually has 8
little bits that can be one or zero and

238
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,749
that's in

239
00:13:45,749 --> 00:13:49,730
binary so that's why I put the leading
zeros on their and their

240
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,959
8 places here so um

241
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,129
thats that so the only difference is a
little shift in the way you can think

242
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:57,499
about it

243
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:00,889
okay but here's a difference with
software

244
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,550
you can't make output pins go higher low

245
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:07,730
because they don't exist you have
control over that but what firmware you

246
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,850
do and

247
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,129
output pins are I or

248
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:16,540
input pins are often called ports on a
microcontroller

249
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,889
so if I wanna make 8-pin go high

250
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,980
I can do with that first line says port
a

251
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,079
equals 2001

252
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,379
everyone turned off I just make more
zeros and that's it

253
00:14:29,379 --> 00:14:32,790
that's firmware that's an actual from
our program to turn a light on and then

254
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,389
off

255
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:38,439
is only one problem instructions take
time

256
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:41,879
very little time so love

257
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,319
and it can be depends on the clock and
the clock is a sort a heartbeat for

258
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,410
any computer and with more modern
computers are like three

259
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:54,860
billion clock pulses per second with
microcontroller it's more like

260
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,910
1,000,000 to like twenty or fifty
million

261
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:03,550
and still instruction happens in one yr
to yr 5 yr 10 to those pulses so it can

262
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,949
be really really sure to my time this
from where program actually will make an

263
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:07,939
LED blink

264
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:11,050
but you won't be able to see it because
it's too fast

265
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,100
so we need to put a delay in between
those test

266
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,410
to statements so you can do that with a
subroutine

267
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,949
Server Team you just call it it goes to
the subroutine which I have

268
00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:28,720
the bottom and then it returns when he
gets a return say men and goes back

269
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,420
where it left off

270
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,489
so in this case it's a little loop that
just goes around and around and around

271
00:15:33,489 --> 00:15:35,889
10,000 times

272
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:40,319
and it wastes time and then returns how
much time well

273
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:44,259
you can calculate it but Spain's was
easier to do trial and error

274
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:47,759
so if it's too long make 10,000 you know

275
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,429
try five thousand if it's too short make
try maybe I'll fifteen or twenty

276
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,639
thousand

277
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,589
so we're getting close to the hole %uh
hello world making a liebling thing here

278
00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:00,529
but there's one other way to

279
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,399
do with the lady and that's with timers
a hardware timer

280
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,529
so most microcontrollers have a harder
time random

281
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:11,980
and it's nothing but a counter it counts
from

282
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,360
some big number down to zero you can
tell it how fast or how slow to document

283
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,149
that number

284
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,249
when it reaches zero something can
happen

285
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:24,279
and you can tell the microcontroller was
a special registers what to do

286
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:27,799
on this case it just sets a flag so on

287
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,299
um we can say make it count at one
microsecond downward

288
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:38,249
said to 60,000 so after um a minute
it'll turned off

289
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:41,299
for a second a rather it'll turn it off

290
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:44,600
and that's really it so another cool
thing with

291
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,739
a software I'm not making like great
software here but

292
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:50,769
one thing you want to do with there's a
main routine that's the main thing you

293
00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:52,139
program does

294
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:55,779
at the beginning you initialize all the
variables and

295
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:59,410
set up all the hardware to do what you
want to do including set the timer the

296
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,889
countdown et cetera

297
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,030
on and then you do the program a key LED
blink and then

298
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:09,180
put it to sleep asleep just puts it into
a very low power mode so that

299
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,530
you don't actually have to flip a
physical off switch it just sits there

300
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,990
waiting for you to hit the reset button

301
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,200
saw my projects they do something for
either a minute or three hours later and

302
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,900
then go into sleep mode

303
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,890
TV gone arm of course I always have with
me

304
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,339
%uh it's now in sleep mode if you push
the button

305
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:35,339
it wakes up in does the thing that makes
the world a better place

306
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:41,190
okay so I'm one other thing just those
for a background stuff for

307
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,690
a doing microcontroller stuff and this
is the thing that scares most people

308
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:48,720
it's actually you have to have a
computer

309
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,060
to hook up to your microcontroller to

310
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,510
program it with some cool from where to
do the cool thing

311
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,910
love your choice so um the software you
need is different depending on what

312
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:04,730
microcontroller use and there's all
these different microcontroller

313
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,420
companies

314
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,660
and for they're all good and they all
kinda suck in their own way

315
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,620
%uh there's always trade-offs just like
all operating system sucking all

316
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,580
have cool things it's just trade-offs
you know so um

317
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,659
there's packages for the AVR which

318
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,720
a all the V's use problem

319
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,000
there's won the just double click it
installs itself

320
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,890
on Windows or Mac OS and it just works
and has a text editor

321
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,270
compile the compiled code and then you
can program your chip for you

322
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,480
on but you also need to have a little
hardware programmer

323
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,210
one of the cool things with AVR is at
the Harbor programmer is really cheap

324
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,230
arm most if it's built into the chip and
you can program it

325
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,760
what's up taken bill yourself and
there's %uh lady I don't you just talk

326
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,490
before

327
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:56,410
has one for like 15 or 20
dollar-something that the other people

328
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,090
have it for similar price

329
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,020
the the company makes a chip sells it
for like 25 or 30

330
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,450
arm so in school and um pic is also a
really good one

331
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,910
I use AVR discuss I I'll learned it more
so I keep using it

332
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,170
but there's nothing wrong with any
others those TV B Gone uses as i log c8

333
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,950
that's also good one arm let a lot of
good ones

334
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,460
but one thing just kinda up a plug for
AVR since i like it so much

335
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,690
um there's a a lot free

336
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,630
open source software and also free open
source hardware

337
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,060
plans that you can find online
downloading build

338
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,070
so many different projects and from

339
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,800
one other things that a mix it easy to

340
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,169
a make cool things with microcontrollers
is so many out there

341
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,010
and you can hack already existing
already working ones

342
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,810
and change them to make 'em cooler or to
just do something totally different

343
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,280
and one other things with
microcontrollers the hardware is almost

344
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,710
always very similar from project to
project a project

345
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,840
all these things have almost the same
hardware

346
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,550
but the firmwares different just program
was something

347
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,870
different different from where you have
something totally different

348
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,480
rather than the many POV I just change
the hardware a little bit

349
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,630
put new firmware and it's a brain
machine or its is RGB trippy late or

350
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:25,040
whatever these things are you know the
you can do so many different things that

351
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,780
arm back to AVR one other thing is

352
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,710
there's AVR freaks stock or

353
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,570
and there are thousands Keeks all over
the world 24/7 who would love nothing

354
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,080
better than to answer your questions

355
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,429
about AVR chips

356
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:48,020
say out strange but true

357
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,970
and if you get a hardware have the
hardware but maybe you'll be one of them

358
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,220
I know I often am home

359
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,400
so here's a real project this is

360
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,180
love like a brief overview how I'll
leave yet as many POV 3

361
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,570
kid works I actually made something very
similar to this with an older click here

362
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:10,720
a microcontroller 1990

363
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,690
cost a lot more than the technology now

364
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,330
but let's see you just wanna make the
letter M

365
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,490
you can program arm

366
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,290
the firmware to have a little section
which is just data

367
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,379
and the data can be representing am

368
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:35,380
so what I have here is columns so um

369
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,490
those are actually one bite love program

370
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,670
memory so what you do is take that by

371
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,570
all of them are one to make the LED's on

372
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,669
in the first column put that on all
those the

373
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,600
pins love a fee port a

374
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,100
and that turns all the lights on then
take

375
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,400
the next by which has only one it a

376
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,490
bit hi put app in the port which is
connected the LED's

377
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,170
now oliphant turn off except that one

378
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,600
and down and that LED lights

379
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,490
and then do the next fight the next day
than expected to finish and then just

380
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,710
rotate through and repeat

381
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,920
and when you do that

382
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,640
it just sits there and looks like its
flickering

383
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,760
but because a our persistence a vision
actually if you

384
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,650
wiggle your eyes back and forth quickly
without moving your head

385
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:38,200
the movement just your eyeballs back and
forth with crazy

386
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,250
arm like someone on the subway and you
might be able to see that there's some

387
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,840
strange things in there but its it's a
lot easier to

388
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:50,250
week and the crazy without doing that
just look at this so

389
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:53,920
arm so thats that's how that works and

390
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,230
like I said earlier I just hacked this

391
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,770
since it's a sin easy development

392
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:04,980
pro a platform really to do a whole
bunch of different projects the first

393
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,520
one actually he was a brain machine but
I'm gonna show you that one

394
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,150
last in the sequence on but some

395
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:20,150
here's a how to hack this into a TV B
Gone

396
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,120
so from you can see with the pictures
here

397
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,640
the hardware is exactly the same with
some minor differences

398
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,740
I didn't bother putting all the V
visible LED's only putting one

399
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,400
and I put in a on infrared

400
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,600
LED that's how TV remote controls work
with invisible

401
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,270
infrared light pulsing in the

402
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:51,150
certain ways so that when the TV series

403
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:54,240
the a a pulsing sequence for

404
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,310
of it does the cool thing and turns
itself off

405
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:05,310
if you tell you something else it does
on cool things

406
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:10,490
that's the infrared emitter and every
time it puts out an of code

407
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,920
the visible LED will blink so

408
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,370
I don't know if you can see that in this
light but I this

409
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,490
a has to thousand

410
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:26,000
a bytes AAV program memory and it can be
program through the program import

411
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,730
and that's not really enough for too
many coats only for eight

412
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,310
codes so I actually hacked this hack

413
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,320
and came up with a TV B Gone kid along
with lady at a

414
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,020
that has 8k flash which is enough for 44
the most popular codes

415
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,750
and I also for that put in four infrared
emitters so that it

416
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,040
and on yeah

417
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:57,040
and the same battery so it gets out to
you know 150 to 200 feet

418
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,330
another thing that I did just because I
thought school was

419
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,720
a.m. a trippy RGB light and each of
these projects uses a different aspect

420
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,970
have microcontroller to just try to a
show

421
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:15,240
what Michael controllers can do we have
one thing up

422
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,760
this is a half

423
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,740
with the TV B Gone kid glued to the brim

424
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,840
here's the batteries and here's an
actual activator switch

425
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,830
so you can look stylish intiki and I
gotta do is here to scratch your head

426
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:39,830
look at it he ended turns off

427
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,430
yet so anyone can do that it's very easy
arm

428
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:50,500
actually wrote a small article and make
magazine last issue

429
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,810
about how to do that the trippy RGB
light

430
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,480
is just kinda fun one rather than have

431
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,180
all red lights I only need three lights
one of them red one green one blue

432
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,120
and with the coping with it red green
blue is you can mix them together in

433
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,190
various intensities you can get

434
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,960
any color that a computer monitor can
help because that's exactly how computer

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,280
monitors work

436
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,120
or TVs but we won't talk about them arm

437
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,790
on the way that I fairy feet brightness
is with this thing called

438
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,110
pulse width modulation and

439
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,930
that's a to a more advanced topic but
what you do is

440
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,020
you um turn the lede on an off

441
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,889
very quickly so you can tell that it's
actually

442
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:38,830
blinking cuz it's going faster than your
eyes can now see that

443
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,830
and but you have it on

444
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,120
for a half the time an offer half the
time then it gets half brightness if you

445
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,370
have it on

446
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,460
for a lot an offer just a little

447
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,640
then it's really bright if you have it
on for just a little an offer most that

448
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,800
time that it's really damn

449
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,120
let me show you this

450
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,590
so here's a a more powerful version up

451
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,200
you know if you can make it a low-power
when you can to help high-power one in

452
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,920
high-power zones calls

453
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,800
it maybe you can see that these are
actually

454
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,770
look like they're kinda linking now
rather than I don't can you see that

455
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,510
or is it too bright in here yeah is it's
it's using pulse with

456
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:25,470
oh yeah helps it won't make a pattern

457
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,050
in the air cuz it's just a doing pulse
width modulation rather than trying to

458
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:29,530
make

459
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:32,570
words and pictures but that's it but if
you

460
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:36,120
then put this and a diffusing

461
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,160
a chamber

462
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,160
like this Parmesan cheese shaker

463
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,730
I am if turn on lights maybe we can

464
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,690
make that work um maybe you can see
there's more than just

465
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:58,400
red green and blue happening here
there's some yellow n

466
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,070
you know it's not that part the sequence
was making to eat colors

467
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,409
news lime green aquamarine it later

468
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:13,410
so it's just it's just the what it is

469
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,190
this is a totally silly but this is a a
solar bug but so

470
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:23,210
way overkill with microcontroller but
what the hell microcontrollers are only

471
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,600
a dollar so why not

472
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,800
put it to use arm one of the things
that's been so popular is a a fibro bot

473
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,010
so if you take a motor and

474
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:38,470
put something off-center as it rotates
and it vibrates like in your cell phone

475
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:44,250
and I did that by soldering a.m.
alligator clip to the rotor uva motor

476
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:47,290
this is basically the same as in many
POV kid

477
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,370
except that it has as one of its output
up to a motor so I did that because high

478
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,840
the motor spins

479
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,620
I have another bit hooked to a speaker
so as the because high on high and low

480
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:01,680
it makes sound to the speaker and %uh
then I have to the LED's going to UV

481
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,890
the antenna here and I S l's solar cell
going to an analog input

482
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,030
and you can program this a
microcontroller so when it's less than

483
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,149
a certain voltage or more than a certain
soldiers you can do different things

484
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,050
so this one if it's a low voltage no
light it just sits there any blanks

485
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,090
if it's a high-voltage he sings and
dances

486
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,090
so vibrating the motor makes him

487
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,070
wiggle around any moves forward on is
pic cleaner legs

488
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:34,820
and the speaker is set to chirp kinda
like an insect

489
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,189
the so thats that cute little guy

490
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:42,230
and down the LED cue is

491
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:47,240
actually the first project I helped with
New York New York City NYC resistor

492
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,280
a new hackerspace that just formed in
New York City

493
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,940
and we got the idea for this from are
these really big cubes

494
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,550
in Chaos Computer congress in pearl and

495
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:02,690
these guys are crazy a in order to make
these big ones there's

496
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,310
outreaches number outsider connections
you have to make we just had a half an

497
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,730
afternoon so we decided to make a key
with 27 LED's

498
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:12,990
shaken cue and down and with

499
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:19,680
without its kinda cute maybe I'm

500
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,340
baby like a little art light sculpture

501
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,480
this one's just green the one in Berlin
those really cool cuz each one has red

502
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,280
green blue LED's he

503
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,300
any color in every node being really
bright and

504
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,580
and they spend no weeks have their lives
programming

505
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,919
feign it's great

506
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,600
so yeah finally the last project that
I'll talk but here's the brain machine

507
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,470
so brain machine is basically the same
as

508
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,170
so many people use kid except to the
LED's go in for your eyes

509
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,460
too long go to a headphone jack which
have two speakers for years so it's

510
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,290
sound instead of light

511
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:05,040
and then instead of programming it to do
the the timing for

512
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,020
making a pattern in space its time with
brainwave frequencies

513
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:14,910
so if you put in a sequence a brainwave
frequencies for

514
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:19,320
waking up than maybe you don't have to
caffeine although

515
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,620
if you want to anyways if you do it for
going to sleep if you're having trouble

516
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,540
sleeping there you go to sleep

517
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,399
if you do it for meditation which is
what I put in here then your brain

518
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
synchronizes to it

519
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,910
and you meditate and the thing that
makes this really fun is that you

520
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,870
loose in 8 colors and patterns from your
subconscious mind along the way

521
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,230
a lot of people seem to like a loosening
down

522
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,660
so this makes it so it's a you can do it
with or without enhancements

523
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,980
on yes so up

524
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,240
I've got a bunch of these if you haven't
tried it or want to try it again

525
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,590
a I've got a chairs cuz you know I
really

526
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:59,740
stand and what about balance are you
doing it for people to

527
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,110
try them out my workshop our at the
mezzanine

528
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,950
and I also have parts for those and all
these other things that the missing

529
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,970
so um oh yeah a these are really popular
party's

530
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,940
so and Hector conferences

531
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:20,330
everywhere I've been including like
family parties little kids just go gaga

532
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:22,510
over these things

533
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,970
maybe it's cuz it like spinning around
really fast I don't know

534
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,059
kids kids love it so I yet whether the
party is

535
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,840
a bunch of urban hipsters or you know
family members

536
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,620
whatever it's fun home

537
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,750
we don't have sound but and here's the
head

538
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:52,440
let's turn it on

539
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,710
so there you go that's kinda that's what
you hear and see when it but these are

540
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,600
a free press here admit all men and this
product is and make magazine volume 10

541
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,450
go and get it departs

542
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:06,570
Medrano and have a great weekend ok

543
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,330
so I was a little video that pre-made

544
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,670
news doing weekend projects from Maxine
I am

545
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:19,110
and now it's basically you all a you had
to say here there's a lot more you can

546
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,809
learn about microcontrollers

547
00:33:20,809 --> 00:33:25,399
sites give you really brief overview arm
and you don't have to know most the

548
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,830
stuff I was talking about process called
have a background for what you're

549
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,010
playing with

550
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:33,290
and maybe that's porns more ideas so

551
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:40,290
yet make make cool things cuz if we
don't will

552
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,380
i'm dumb I have the plans these are all
open source info free from plans and

553
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,670
they're on my website confit Electronix

554
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:57,000
so yes there's any questions feel free

555
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,450
was see all down at my workshop

556
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:06,500
um

557
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,310
the bring machine has one sequence that
I have on my website

558
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,150
and if you have any questions use the
microphones

559
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:19,130
is the recording all this but some 0 I
have a

560
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,120
a meditation sequence other people have
come up with other sequences and that's

561
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,719
on the blog on the Make Magazine website

562
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:32,720
makes enough com microphone

563
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:39,730
yeah

564
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:47,020
ok maybe not okay

565
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,589
is the microphone working other it's
working now okay

566
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:56,629
my question is a related to the code
protection bits that are found in some

567
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:57,770
microcontrollers

568
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:01,050
%ah summer the microcontrollers you set
a better

569
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:05,510
fuse and all of a sudden you can no
longer read the code back out to them is

570
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,930
there

571
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,328
has there been any effort to like fact
that I get around that because it

572
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:11,800
certainly would be nice if to take
things apart

573
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,180
import from around there because it
should be relatively easy

574
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,450
disassemble and stuff read yeah it's
very easy view is that if you have

575
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,609
access to the program memory it's very
easy to disassemble it and figure out

576
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:22,540
what's going on

577
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,200
%uh but there is no way to get it out if
they bring those fuses

578
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,960
unless you have an electron microscope
then you can cut it open

579
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,770
and look at the actual physical layout
and see what's on what's

580
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:39,500
what's of and in now China and other
places where they don't really respect

581
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:43,470
that's changing now in China lot but in
places where they don't respect

582
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,680
intellectual

583
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,000
property on they do that so if
something's really popular within three

584
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,089
months still have their electron
scanning microscope and all

585
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:55,810
cut it open and lookin what's inside and
duplicated

586
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:59,180
and sell it cuz you know scanning
electron microscope you can do for

587
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,700
what tens of thousands of dollars and if
they're gonna make millions on its well

588
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,260
worth it

589
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,359
but us for as hackers there's no way we
can do that

590
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:12,819
I'd like to to provide an alternative
answer to that question so it is yes

591
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:16,290
there are fuses and yes there are burned
in one way or another

592
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,529
but oftentimes they have burned in a
reversible

593
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:24,680
way well all you gotta do is shines and
UV light on specific parts up to chip in

594
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,328
a a great place to start looking for
four points days to fly logic

595
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:34,740
block fly logic dotnet day they do that
and very offense level but day and

596
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,310
funny to funny studio step come will
tell you I did you done your

597
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,130
microcontroller

598
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,530
oh that's that's really cool so are you
have one thing if you're going to use UV

599
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:47,200
drive to cut the chip open and you got
to be sure you don't erase the program

600
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,150
memory while you do it

601
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:52,240
of yeah it's cool

602
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,180
thanks another point you might be
interested in summer those controllers

603
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:00,299
if you from the mine reduced voltage you
can often get them to Sourav

604
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,190
heaviest temporary sort of breakdown in
such a way that they will spit outdated

605
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,369
expected that supposed to too often get
you into them
