1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,129
can launch the missiles all written like
that written with ease

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,130
relief aid any you know any use

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:09,219
can be potentially illegal and its it
scares me

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:14,200
should scare you guys I I'm gonna give
some lessons and the biggest will I want

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:14,639
to say is

6
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,999
it's really hard to tell the criminals
the people we wanna stop we wanna hold

7
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:20,919
them aside say

8
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:24,150
their bad and people that do well what
we do

9
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,509
now if you're if your research if you're
researching security

10
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,949
if you are out helping you know helping
your

11
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:35,030
your corporate clients on and I i
decided to be a little cheesy

12
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,359
so it's really hard to tell the
criminals apart from the good guys so

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,800
we have a freelance security researcher
now evil computer criminal can anyone

14
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,929
tell the difference here

15
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,199
and that Family Guy

16
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,329
help desk you know who's trying to fix
our stuff okay

17
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:56,850
up lesson number one just because you
can do it doesn't make it a

18
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,159
doesn't make a beagle arm the think its
usual business practices for

19
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,340
defending your stuff doing research I
it's fairly normal to go and rifle

20
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,950
through

21
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,140
you know hot somethings somethings
acting wacky my network

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,580
are 1users doing something of I should
go and basically poke around their

23
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,060
system to figure out who they are

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,070
if they're up to no good are for just
being you know we're

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,510
kanzi I'm and I give an example

26
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,290
love her recent case out love I'm North
Dakota

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,230
I this guy David rates I it's kind of a
pain in the ass but he I'm

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,600
base for suspects Sierra I love

29
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,840
of doing something wrong I'm not sure
what does I've only read the court

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,030
documents never actually says what he's
doing

31
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,540
but he basically gets does his own
transfer on CA riskiness urs

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,730
water all the machines you've got okay
um

33
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:52,990
and from an IT point of view if you
didn't want to give up that information

34
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,110
you wouldn't allow you you wouldn't
allow the DNS server

35
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,510
give you some transfer right you know if
it's sort of like

36
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,850
he didn't want me in this room you
shoulda locked the door

37
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,980
ob unfortunately

38
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,000
out Sierra seem to have a better lawyer
than

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,250
brits does and they successfully argue
on we can grant you permission

40
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,600
we can grant you permission to go run

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,100
host dash L on our system and I'm

42
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,600
you have obtained important

43
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,549
data about our company now he's on the
hook for

44
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,840
now it's only civil charges it's not
criminal charge but he

45
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,170
if if the DA had the same thought would
have been sorry

46
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,720
that's five years up to five years in
prison for computer hacking for doing

47
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,530
something that

48
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,410
its one-line it's not Italy arm

49
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,549
and I give the analogy to some people
that you know downstairs is place where

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,060
they have all this stuff

51
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,170
that's useful like you know beverages
and snacks and what not I can just taken

52
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,030
walkouts a convenience store

53
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,020
um just because you can k can walk it
doesn't mean it's not legal

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,980
okay where's this going possible to
study

55
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,910
Eagle on also when you with these nice

56
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,030
be Hui laws prosecutors got a bone to
pick

57
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,940
can make them hurt people now a lot of
times we want you know

58
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,870
there's this old ruled the law called
hard cases make bad law

59
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,470
someone is bad we want to punish them we
want to find some way of making them pay

60
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,930
%uh maury true great example more into
something a ship back

61
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,840
you know we've all heard a percocet
Megan Meier myspace suicide case

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,150
chill adult should not do that teenagers

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,430
but she's been charged with

64
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:45,150
among other things two counts of a
unauthorized access to myspace

65
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,340
servers because she went in

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,540
creative username and used use the login
to

67
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,760
get information about Megan Meier on

68
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,149
normally that would in the old days

69
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,560
you know prior to this year that would
ban at most a contract violation if

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,130
myspace had a desire to actually sue her
for whatever it would been civil charges

71
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:10,310
now its up to five years in prison

72
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:16,649
for something that normally we thought
was just normal briefing arm

73
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,608
and the others another scary cases a
citron which allows

74
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,159
retroactive up unauthorized access

75
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:28,248
you have been given he basically
completed files on his work laptop

76
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:31,460
while he worked for a company and

77
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,448
they retroactively charging because at
the time he was planning to leave the

78
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,240
company

79
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,439
if it was still simply had way you know
had a a company laptop

80
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:43,900
deleted files on it I A C went after him

81
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,309
not for breach of contract not for
unfair competition

82
00:04:48,309 --> 00:04:51,569
but for a violation out there

83
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:55,550
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act arm if a
prosecutor was convinced

84
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,139
he would be looking up to 10 years in
prison

85
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,919
for deleting files on his work laptop

86
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:06,589
presumably your authorized to do that
you know you don't wanna have to ask

87
00:05:06,589 --> 00:05:07,270
your boss

88
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,758
boss arm I have all this some all these
image files that I downloaded for

89
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,839
personal use

90
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,449
kinda leedom now

91
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:21,069
okay so permission is now getting fluid
people are using it

92
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:26,039
up in a weird weird way okay where am I
going with this

93
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,430
don't be unlikable and unfortunately
most people in this room most people

94
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,139
were interested in him

95
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,240
in security most people are interested
hacking are not

96
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,689
particularly likable from mainstream we
look funny we talk funny

97
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:43,439
were interested and funny thanks and its
unsafe to be outside the mainstream

98
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,110
with these ferry very broad very fake
loss

99
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,520
okay now this is a chunk of on

100
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,628
something that every time you use Yahoo
you agree to

101
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,559
if you violate any of this it's now
criminal

102
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:02,770
so you'll read the Terms of Service
every web page you ever gone to right

103
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,558
and you understood just to say that
there's danger stuff out there

104
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:11,740
okay is that enough I'd

105
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,020
okay therefore basic laws that affect
but researchers

106
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,609
and bought defectors arm the wiretap act
which prevents you from

107
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,080
I intercepting up electronic among other
communications

108
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,770
while in transmission you ob

109
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,109
any it mostly for it explicitly protects
the contest the communication

110
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:35,599
stuff like headers meta data about it

111
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:38,599
is safe that's a different law thats my

112
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,430
it gets a lot more difference to people
who are who are sniffing packets

113
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,009
are there's a broad prohibition against
interception except

114
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,809
out for a couple exceptions will get
into in a sec um

115
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,839
contemporaneously is important

116
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:56,369
I'm pulling stuff office desk is not in
perception

117
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:00,089
pulling stuff of the wire its

118
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,369
I it does two things: it criminalizes
the intersection

119
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:08,119
and it criminalizes the disclosure if
you know

120
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:12,279
that it was illegally intercepted

121
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:15,649
now there are a couple exceptions which
many of you will fall into

122
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:18,749
hopefully on valid wiretap or are

123
00:07:18,749 --> 00:07:23,349
well I put five in there arm I really
don't wanna get asked about 5-6

124
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,349
all to start screaming profanities and
while that might be an interesting part

125
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:30,279
performance arts and not really helpful

126
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:33,649
um more importantly that prior
permission of a party to the

127
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:34,960
communication

128
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,689
under federal law any one party to
communication can say

129
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:42,419
yes you can intercept my day yes you can
intercept you can wire technical is my

130
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,409
conversation if I allow

131
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:47,789
some states require all parties to
approve

132
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:51,289
but under federal law all you have to do
is have one

133
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,289
are you can also use it to identify
source electronic interference

134
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,479
the way this is written it looks like
radio interference but it doesn't say

135
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,199
that

136
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,110
so it's a potential defense if you are
somehow arguing that

137
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,449
a up say it and I'll service attack
against you

138
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,479
well thats elektronik its interfering
with my stuff I'm allowed to find

139
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:15,699
I'm alive sniffers packs interment
where's coming from

140
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,899
and provide are providers very

141
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,800
it's very broadly written if you are
offering a service either to

142
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,849
other people are bought two other people
either employees

143
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:31,479
our customers you are providing
electronic communication service

144
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,208
doesn't say is: but it clearly includes
ISP's here on a corporate lawn

145
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:39,440
you ronna education away you are clearly
a prizefighter

146
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,829
under the wiretap act and you are
allowed to

147
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,480
sniff packets to your heart's content
provided

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,110
it's necessary to render service are
you're using to protect the rights or

149
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,800
property

150
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,000
of the provider on

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,410
its also allow for fraud against

152
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,370
a phone company not using the phone
company

153
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,839
if a is using the fuck you is using the
tell

154
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,730
telco to defraud be the the telephone
company

155
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,880
see can not sniff the packets for that
purpose

156
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,170
if they're using from the phone company
the are allowed to sniff the packets

157
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,579
of there are exceptions to the
prohibition on distribution once you

158
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,639
pull packets

159
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:29,110
to actually give the ob to actually give
the contents of that

160
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:33,000
transmission to another party on you are
barred

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,589
unless you either did not know it was
obtained illegally

162
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:40,610
are arm you have permission %uh

163
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,620
one of the parts involved now

164
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,050
this is the explicit content to the
communication not meditate

165
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,019
if you are so you doing research from
botnets and you say

166
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,970
arm here are the types of packets
weekend here the amount secured

167
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,940
characteristics if you're not giving
specific information about them

168
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:04,540
you're safe like an actual you note the
content of

169
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,339
on trap and trace this allows the car to
capture meditate

170
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,970
arm where it's going where it came from
time

171
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,620
size arm it is also been used to gather

172
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,730
from to and subject lines on

173
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,050
emails it still fluid we haven't yet
figured out everything

174
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,699
cover-ups so if it's about the
communication it likely falls on track

175
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:28,139
and trace which allows

176
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,690
basically I testing maintenance billing
you have a much greater protection on

177
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,230
the provider on the provider example US
recipient may also

178
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,379
just accept but I'm allowed to broadcast
the suppression

179
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,050
capturing

180
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,459
one last important law stored
Communications Act this is for polling

181
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,009
data

182
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,779
from desk arm are actually any storage
no matter how temporary

183
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:56,199
this has been used to arm define dado

184
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:59,620
say for example packet waltz resin in
the memory of a router

185
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,629
is in storage no matter how incidental

186
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:07,170
as long as it's not on the wire now I
I've read one case for the talk about

187
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,920
polling data of a router

188
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,329
but it's completely it I wouldn't
guarantee that that's a safe place to

189
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:16,620
safe place to sniff packets unless you
have something else

190
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,829
back but

191
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,959
it's still a protection there on the
provider ex

192
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,360
protection hundreds for communications
act is very very broad

193
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,690
you're allowed if you hold the data the
date is on your system

194
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,250
your love to read for any reason

195
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,910
so unless there's some other guarantee
of privacy

196
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,649
arm your mail server whoever owns it

197
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,019
can read your email

198
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:48,060
arm there's maybe a slight rank 1 some
states that don't permit this

199
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,610
but under federal law you're generally
protected

200
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,540
and the fun one Computer Fraud and Abuse
Act this is not been really used coupley

201
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,050
has a change in a couple years until
very very recently your people rely

202
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,649
are prosecutors realizing it's nicely
broadly written

203
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,810
so you can get you can kinda figure out
asserts meet attacks against people

204
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,550
like I'm makes the following

205
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,639
unauthorized access a legal if you opt
ain't if you

206
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,959
either unauthorized without
authorization access another system and

207
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:21,800
obtain

208
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,790
financial medical federal interest
namely state secrets

209
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,660
Tomic energy stuff our financial
information

210
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,730
that's a violation up to 10 years in
prison ob

211
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,990
if you have a fraudulent intent with
fewer

212
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:40,959
with your access and it causes five
thousand dollars in damage

213
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,220
and that five thousand dollars can be
calculated as it cost us five thousand

214
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,949
dollars to clean it up

215
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:52,339
we had a higher forensics guy and 20
answered the phone and Otis 5 grant

216
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,029
on to find out

217
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,329
what happened that's that cat gets
calculated

218
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:03,019
so its really really easy to hit five
great

219
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:07,209
I am recklessly causing damage without
permission

220
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,490
see you can affect the intent but if you
say for example

221
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:16,199
right a 0 a worm travels across the
internet your name is Robert Morris

222
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,730
that was the first uses I've 18 USC
10:30

223
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,529
so few recklessly cause damage by

224
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:27,560
you committing an act on the Internet by
transmitting information

225
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,069
arm you can get caught up on this

226
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:36,290
okay we have state laws that affect this
stuff are

227
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,660
if you're in an individual state you get
affected by the state laws as well

228
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,719
they often mirror federal laws because

229
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,160
up basically legislators or easy arm

230
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,949
they've already written at the federal
level why should we rewrite it

231
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:56,209
full descrip I wiretap laws the one big
exception

232
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:59,959
some states have are what they what we
like to call two-party States

233
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,300
all parts involved in a communication
have to give

234
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,529
have to get permission and

235
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:10,120
the other thing that will affect ice I
for CC'ing I affecting pot

236
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,240
researchers is common law courts

237
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,139
I nuisance which is arm if I if I
operate my property in such a way that

238
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:19,850
affects

239
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:24,540
your property you can sue me for the
damages I've cost

240
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,740
I'm slander and libel I say negative

241
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,009
untrue fact about

242
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,759
other people either imprint libel

243
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:39,639
spoke slander I am liable for your
losses

244
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:45,050
and some states still allow a privacy
tort named intrusion into seclusion

245
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,480
I broadcast true but private fax

246
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,220
about you I may be liable for your
emotional loss

247
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,370
where did this come into play against a
botnet researcher are medicare

248
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,439
okay I'm capture you wanna start with
well

249
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:04,629
I wanna see how a bot works I want to
capture

250
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:09,449
the raw excusable so couple different
ways you can you can actively doing

251
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:12,730
hot I think I've heard there's a malware
site so you know

252
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,560
Russian hosted site i cant download you
know the latest version of

253
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,730
up some new some new exploit and dished

254
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,839
the code that makes happen I skin 0
click Control

255
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,509
ob you know exploit you know exploit
this box click here

256
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,399
arm now you can

257
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,269
actively go out by FTP you can actually
go out by using

258
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:38,230
a vulnerable browser are application
that another

259
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,189
exploit another XQ no executed but will
taxi for example

260
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:45,759
arm affordable website a web browser
sale I can explore

261
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,829
I wanna find a tax that attack that
browser

262
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,579
I just basically you know go to thought
you believed bad sites

263
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,800
with Mike Fontenot browser hopefully I
pick up some malware

264
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,920
that I can later at a loss are you can
simulate you can use a honeycomb to go

265
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,249
out and get

266
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:05,350
okay fairly straightforward your

267
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,730
going out trying to get this menu of
passive stuff you can build a honeypot

268
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,610
arnett

269
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,350
that's a basically saying going hey
attacked me come on

270
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,149
area hi I mister you know ask excusable

271
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,100
come on it and you save a copy you know
are you can

272
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,589
you know actually collected from end
users who have said hey

273
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,850
my boxes exploited other some
interesting code here let me go play

274
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,740
with

275
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,749
so those are the methods to go get now
where

276
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:35,949
what's possible you can screw up thank
you can go get

277
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:39,290
arrested are sued in Sana'a civil action

278
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,999
4 that work okay

279
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:46,040
I and I'm actually I i talk to someone
who had this

280
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,110
who did this fame is configured it all
to go out

281
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:52,819
and check for vulnerabilities up it was
broke

282
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,529
it basically the last some guy in the UK

283
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,040
on and activated a script

284
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,410
that sent SMS messages to all it is om

285
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,899
Randwick a heating ventilation air
conditioning company

286
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,010
on that that the guy was attacked on

287
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,579
have SMS messages going to their cell
phones saying like you know

288
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,139
it was kind of like idea to say like go
to this address and go fix their stuff

289
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,470
I and you they had really nice little
web script our script on the web server

290
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,620
that would allow it

291
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,750
the guy was running the company to come
to click and say you know go here to do

292
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,470
this

293
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,890
unfortunately update the guy went to me
and ask

294
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,950
he wasn't on my congresswoman practicing
law yet op

295
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,950
he wrote this wrote the script I got
fined vulnerabilities well

296
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,080
it basically hammered this Scottish guy
server

297
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,860
and he sent several thousand SMS is to
office workers

298
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,960
so you know every and I think their
charge

299
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,140
charge in like 10 tense per so the guy
gets like you know several thousand

300
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,960
dollar cell phone bill

301
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,410
of and Fig trace it back to

302
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,600
my guys like others a scion sconce

303
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,310
fuck past

304
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,879
understand y Kawai what happens a call
about this like

305
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,200
so you're going out looking for
vulnerabilities like you wrote it like

306
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,840
yeah it seemed to be it broke his surfer
interestingly

307
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,389
like okay mins ago

308
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:24,890
into my cat socks like not your lawyer
hands like

309
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,900
consuming like and and gonna do in this
holding up your flight five things like

310
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,670
that's not good okay but that's ok call
you tomorrow on eventually figure out

311
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,170
like

312
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,440
of a hundred box and say I'm sorry and
that that's what that work but

313
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,950
imagine instead if you did that to
someone who was

314
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,840
angrier band you know down then the
Scottish Scottish guy can't really

315
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,399
you know comment come to the united
states and so Am up and you know like

316
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,960
we're not gonna see no mister mister
hagas flying over going I want justice

317
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,700
it's just funny that's a Scottish accent
I can't really do that

318
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,960
I'm but imagine if it's instead you do
that too

319
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,800
all I'll mid-size companies and you just
pound shit

320
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,720
wanted the box cuz you're your your
honey clients is misconfigured

321
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,010
like arch hit she hit a random site %ah

322
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,710
six times a second and instead you just
basically have it you know have yours

323
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:24,680
thousand of thousands of honey clients
pound their server

324
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,370
0 echoed books you've in government on
it now serves

325
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,480
you were intending to do I it's possible
so if you make one Shipley

326
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,710
and negligence is important work if you
intentionally do it

327
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,030
that's we've review now committed a
criminal act

328
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,629
of but if you negligent you just loops
arm

329
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,520
I use the sample config file supposed to
writing my own

330
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,980
I'll is it bad if if we just basically

331
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:54,440
pipe Piper everything 83 can do that you
know pops plumbing supply

332
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:57,710
group think bob can be cast

333
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,850
on its that was that was for the big
hype

334
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,460
home you could also potentially getting
use in store

335
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,490
as you used your property in such a way
that it's for with

336
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:11,660
my property I have read if any these
cases yep it's

337
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,370
but a lot of computer geek lawyers like
this is

338
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,170
this is going to be someone's gonna sue
under this and eventually okay

339
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,910
what about this downloading from our
positive for E I'm

340
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,960
and I i wrote a paper about why effort a
paper about this cuz I keep on like

341
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,270
looking at it going I

342
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:36,670
other work to do but the hypothetically
is you Kevin our POS because you're

343
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,590
Symantec

344
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,629
you have in our project has your you
know week dude 94

345
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,640
likes putting virus code on the way the
post now where repositories

346
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,830
if you illegally downloaded from
Symantec semantic is going to come after

347
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,500
you because execution by subscription if
you want to do research from our stuff

348
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,850
versus week dude is you know in his
baseman

349
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,610
working working kinko's up

350
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:05,690
he's not going to be able to come after
you for for you know staking

351
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:09,860
a log in and going in taking stuff but
it's potentially a

352
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,110
%uh violation contract and with the
changes

353
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,470
in the interpretation of I've 10:30 it
may actually be a criminal act to

354
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,450
up spoofer a username go in and download

355
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,420
someone's malware the chest gonna get
sued by an actual criminal

356
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,720
its era because it's really hard so I
can people calling at 911 going to

357
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,510
we got ripped off on the scope deal I
mean it still happens

358
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,710
but it's really unlikely that ya

359
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:40,630
we're on our we run out I where server
and a virus

360
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,110
now where coding sigh and and this dude

361
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,510
downloaded largest of and out you know
we have spammers the search man

362
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:51,620
were starving here you know I'm sure
it's not going to happen but if you're

363
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,400
some if you're

364
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,210
an actual you know no we're not we're
not hackers were security researchers

365
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,630
on those people might actually go on
hire someone like me to go in

366
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,200
right behind ya right RIAA going I get
any stuff left

367
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,300
now what will take at okay

368
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,250
passive capture legal issues arm if you
configure your honey Potter

369
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,170
it correctly I'm its possibly nuisance

370
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,830
if if you used actual life she said if
you into the building like a true

371
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,949
emulated honey net where it's an
archival an x-box playing like to punch

372
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,300
of

373
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,419
on patch windows ninety eight boxes arm

374
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:34,640
but actually had you know I K now I a
buncha

375
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,760
I got a bunch on patch ninety eight
boxes as my honey that

376
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,270
if a up if it gets compromise and is
used to attack someone else

377
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,210
it's potentially a nuisance claim on I'm
gonna give the fight alert

378
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,030
now up it's not actually well okay know
it's actually been sued for it but it's

379
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:52,410
just

380
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:57,280
it should be out there so if you can dis
you should monitor any

381
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,620
honey net honey pot that you're running
to make sure it's not actually

382
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,310
you know fucking with other people

383
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,570
I and the final one end-user collection
arm

384
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,750
if it's without permission and and try
to think that how you would do this

385
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,810
without permission like

386
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,120
oh I'm you know I'm gonna go and hacks
are into a box its already been

387
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,310
infected and sank out the

388
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,678
yank out the pot and patch the system

389
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,679
and I i've talked to people like what
got this great it's gonna be a white box

390
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,730
gonna go out and look for bad pots

391
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,240
and two-week delete the bad part
compassion system so it doesn't happen

392
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,330
again

393
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,428
I thought that works that would be that
would be cool

394
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,620
except violates federal law and what if
you get

395
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,700
wrong what if there's a vulnerability in
your own code and you basically go

396
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,630
and on Patch thousands of systems you
you gonna be

397
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,550
really you can be mister popular

398
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,990
so ob if you the unlawful access

399
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,820
if you're capturing life packets I don't
know how you do that with an end-user

400
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,790
collection

401
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,240
unless you may be you know I'm gonna
capture without permission now to get

402
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,210
permission

403
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:08,630
of your if you either your the IT guy

404
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:13,560
at installation you to say I'm gonna go
down I'm gonna go Paul

405
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,960
code of your box are you could just say
its it's our box

406
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,360
you know it's the company's computer
were allowed to do whatever we like to

407
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,900
so it's really for this hypothetical I'm
gonna go out and download code of your

408
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,030
machine without you ever knowing about

409
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:35,178
okay this is also the hypothetical the
River Center Inc

410
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:38,560
like could get cooking now where
manufacturers to you under the Digital

411
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,320
Millennium Copyright Act

412
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,928
I thought that's the most ask for to
requestion I've come up with today

413
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:49,450
you know it's like know if that's that's
more like to you're doing a drug deal

414
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,720
your comment come on we're doing a drug
deal shop the sky

415
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,890
and the cokes bat like you double it's a
double whammy like it's not gonna happen

416
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,970
but I thought of

417
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,000
home what about kato

418
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,950
member at the I'm going to trick you
into downloading malware

419
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:13,380
well potentially that's a company that
might sue you for doing the reverse

420
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,190
reverse engineering on their code a few
if they have some some forms encryption

421
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,260
to protect you from

422
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,490
well reverse engineering the code forget
what it does

423
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:25,080
Catholic if that happens it will be
interesting to watch

424
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,668
I don't know yet I it's protected out
there but that's like

425
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:31,980
you should worry about that about as
much as media

426
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,200
but that level of fear like if they'll
be bad

427
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,210
about that likely arm

428
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,130
going back 30 if you're running a
sandbox you inadvertently compromise

429
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,429
other systems with their sandbox

430
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:47,929
bad

431
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:52,100
publication the biggest when you're
gonna run into is libel and slander

432
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,220
this has been used cater where

433
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,890
you so you pull piece %uh malware of you
were u-verse engineer

434
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,640
and he say this is malware

435
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,720
this is the worst piece of software and
I wholeheartedly say that

436
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,929
you know Microsoft Office is malware up

437
00:26:09,929 --> 00:26:13,150
you're gonna get a phone call from
Microsoft because you have

438
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,550
slandered their product by calling it
now where

439
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,678
arm you have to defend by saying cheats

440
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,740
its it is now but really don't wanna
ever get litigation Microsoft

441
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,179
I'm just cancel just well we won

442
00:26:28,179 --> 00:26:31,460
respect 8 million dollars to defend this
I'm broke

443
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,810
great arm but live also requires a
negative

444
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:39,610
untrue statement of fact arm

445
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:42,630
and has the same effect cannot it with
me you know if it's

446
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,750
me your opinion its yeah you

447
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,600
are bad person great on its it's a
statement and

448
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,290
you are a dishonest person that alleges
fact

449
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,158
so you could potentially looking lawsuit
if you describe something

450
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,570
from a

451
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,918
from a legitimate company as this is
malware

452
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,919
so you want to make sure you got all
your ducks in a line you wanna like rack

453
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,510
up a fax

454
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,419
I trade secret if offender has given you

455
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,750
controlled secret stuff we say you have
to sign an NDA

456
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:19,669
you can show the same one else if you
divulged that information in your body

457
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:20,470
research

458
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,470
I don't know how that would happen but
it should just be in the back your minds

459
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,070
somehow you're like playing with someone
else's code

460
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:31,418
I'm back like how was this

461
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:34,630
you know how will this be attacked by
parts like you know Microsoft doing

462
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:41,630
their next-generation operating system

463
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,690
okay it's a fancy maybe Cisco despite no
people have got in trouble for divulging

464
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,169
Cisco trade secrets

465
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,340
um and the dive altman if you illegally
intercept packets

466
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,179
you are not a provider you instead you
are just

467
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,220
I you know show researcher and your
sniffing packets

468
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,510
from arm between 8 botnet

469
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,860
her and I individually can't

470
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,909
compromise PC if you're also sniffing
packets

471
00:28:12,909 --> 00:28:16,260
that they are using legitimately say for
example it's

472
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,899
might get my laptop's compromised I'm
sending email to my wife

473
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:22,990
while the pot at her sending
transmissions are

474
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,070
if you broadcast my stuff you may have a
legally

475
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:33,000
you know UF you violated my rights I may
have a lawsuit against

476
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,909
okay I next talking about monitoring of
hers

477
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:40,179
on you can either I

478
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:44,909
sniff packets between the IRC channel
that's running the botnet

479
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:48,390
are active you know login

480
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,360
and be act like a boss up

481
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,330
the biggest problem is what I like to
call them mixed server if if a botnet

482
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,658
her is using a a legitimate server

483
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:04,230
as an has other non populated traffic

484
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,700
ob you may possibly run into a 25-11
violations your sniffing packets

485
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,210
you're not supposed now you have a
defense by saying

486
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,730
these were intended this these are
published like anyone can walk into the

487
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,899
sire see chap

488
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:20,580
so they are broadcast I'm not sniffing
packets

489
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,710
I'm receiving and that's in about
effects but

490
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,580
here now in a gray area we might have
going have to reset defense

491
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,840
Assange book you can charge in utah

492
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,880
I drew a little schematic here just

493
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,990
to show where you might be doing
sniffing so we have an infected box

494
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:42,340
and okay

495
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,690
affected box IRC server

496
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,830
infected boxes Heidi IRC channel IRC
server

497
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,250
10 you know that get transmitted through
the herder her sense commands back

498
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,620
infected box okay we have a researcher
once a sniffle

499
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:00,630
bats interception now of course it might
be per it

500
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,940
its left there's a low chance of getting
actually in trouble for because

501
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,220
the bar her is not going to raise speak

502
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,330
legally they may do other things but
they're not going to try to resolve

503
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,520
legal stick

504
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,899
are sniffing their may actually violated
if that higher see box

505
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,149
is also used for legitimate traffic

506
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:24,919
and that's also sniffing traffic but
chances are that's

507
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,690
the infected guys not gonna complain but

508
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,909
we have neutral 1&2 there also a much
higher seed box

509
00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:36,970
so they're talking the researchers
sniffs Ian

510
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:42,200
still violated this the the wiretap act
but because they've done it

511
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,470
to a neutral who can go to the cops and
say book

512
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,139
this guy and I don't care if he works
for Carnegie Mellon

513
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:56,139
is sniffing my traffic is violate the
law punish

514
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,340
now this is some have been curious about
can you sniff a wife

515
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,649
infection and I thought

516
00:31:04,649 --> 00:31:07,929
if you can somehow sort out the packets
to make sure the

517
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:11,159
all you're doing is that suppose
legitimate traffic I think you might be

518
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,350
okay

519
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,780
okay I am issues are standing this is

520
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:23,030
can criminal soon and chances are the
answer is No

521
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,690
for you know reasons i stated before
however

522
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,940
innocent traffic innocent users can
complain saying you

523
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,130
had no right to do that you're allowed
to go screw the evil-doers

524
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,810
I'm not the evil doer

525
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,230
you know it's up okay

526
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,100
big promise that it's really kinda hard
to determine if site is truly

527
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,300
if you're sniffing traffic from are they
legitimate or not because

528
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,440
they're gonna be sites you can't tell
you know the their capital flag like I

529
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,990
no work readiness

530
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,360
okay hypothetical I researcher
implements honey nut

531
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,330
assumes all incoming and outgoing
traffic solicit cancers nothing should

532
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,360
be routed here on

533
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,889
that's legitimate see only some gonna
come in are people trying to attack

534
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:13,200
from Misrata traffic gets Misrata

535
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,610
innocent traffic for some reason someone
mistype something

536
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:22,760
on are they gonna get in trouble for
sniffing is packets

537
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,379
arm I believe they're safe because they
are party to the transmission

538
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,490
that the botnet that person is running
honey

539
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,220
now if they make the traffic content
available I think they're still safe

540
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,380
because they were intended recipient
even though

541
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,649
it was in the actual intentions like
they can say it was miss router to us

542
00:32:45,649 --> 00:32:51,700
from no fault of are installed at the
sender we're safe

543
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,560
I'm ever acquisitions not wiretapping

544
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:59,379
up but you have to exit from a defense
you raise that after you've been charged

545
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,250
so you have to basically say yeah we get
all that but

546
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,350
so if you're if they don't fire defense
well now

547
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:10,240
you know now you're in trouble I the
promises that

548
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
as a humming that operator you cannot

549
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,560
use the provider effects because you are
what service are you provide

550
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,720
you are using this to well as usual
protect my network

551
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,190
your egg hunt but what's that affect

552
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:27,760
you know each you put those out there
you know you're like the National

553
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,810
Geographic crew going

554
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:33,168
coats and state Houma scaring

555
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:37,659
you like we're protecting ago now you on

556
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:40,780
good film camera shows you are
protecting the go

557
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:45,490
I'm I believe that what about consent
receiver granted consent to the feds are

558
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,210
okay

559
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:50,810
state if they if they're two-party state
can get interested

560
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,730
I as example PA law is strange on this

561
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:59,630
all the parties have to agree in writing
I've actually seen this enforced yet but

562
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,030
with and has been verified by the AG but
you send

563
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,408
the the IQ can to a private wiretap

564
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:09,600
unless you get eight terms a service
that song

565
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,790
so pa.-based ISP's will just generally
you know

566
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,509
the put that the Terms of Service and by
using it and they may send a copy

567
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:20,850
from search the AG okay

568
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,870
defects for everyone is not doing
research is going

569
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:27,638
do for getting hammered what we do to
protect I'm

570
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,500
pass a modern defence they stay in the
game you put have an idea as to figure

571
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,870
out what

572
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,440
what's going on op RC example your
instead of being a

573
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,970
and safe defending your own sister
offending someone else's arkansas

574
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:43,389
with the permission within scope that's
important you were allowed

575
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:47,179
to sniff packets for provider if your
employees

576
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,540
if he is within the scope of your
employment this is important

577
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,330
if you are and just because you're I'm
an IT worker

578
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:59,630
is not good enough actress be explicitly
in there

579
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,390
arm and it's best to have it in your
employment if you're running a sniffer

580
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,210
getting there I'm allowed to run a
sniffer this is what allowed two runs at

581
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,390
first that way when you do run the
sniffer you are not violating

582
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:16,379
25-11 defense I

583
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,470
if you discover control sir say for
example one of your boxes has been

584
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,280
compromised

585
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,690
and someone is using it hence an IRC as
a IRC server

586
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:30,240
to run a pot I'm I believe you're safe

587
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,510
and intercepting that traffic because

588
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,470
it's your box you are the shipping
affecting

589
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,500
okay I taking down the structure

590
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,760
of an attacking bought polling the plot

591
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,240
if it's your box you're allowed to if
it's on your network you're allowed to

592
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,410
fewer ISP

593
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,420
and one of your customers boxes is
either

594
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:56,910
is spewing packets you are allowed to
thank you

595
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,950
know around whatever it it's the worst
you have permission

596
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:06,069
and there's actual permission hey Bob
Forsch your your boxes hosts were taken

597
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,790
offline

598
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,870
thank you are constructed punish

599
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:13,690
are say for example up you have a term
service

600
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:18,359
if you're if your box for its peeling
crack its offline

601
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,450
are DNS poisoning the the only thing
that might get you there's

602
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:26,930
if you I'm in your contract between the
DNS host ur

603
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,060
and her if Grevers being up attacked

604
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:34,380
ob you may want to have some clause in
there it says you know we will do

605
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,450
whatever we have to do to protect
ourselves

606
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,089
protect the system's up to any might
want explicitly right that an

607
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:44,470
I wooden because then if you if if that
next generation we find out something

608
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,970
else you do like

609
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:49,319
some weird new magic pack

610
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:53,100
of one thing I won't have as much a
response every time someone you know

611
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:56,900
usually after four or five drinks will
start psych to know we need to take

612
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,920
at and you know I've you don't like what
build-up

613
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,970
hot army white box that got that work
DDoS

614
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,280
fan take okay outline

615
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,600
put down the whiskey ob which whiskey

616
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,049
well whiskeys a source of all sorts of
good and bad idea yes

617
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:18,650
up you know last night whiskey almost
had a store in our motorcycles

618
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:22,170
out on this floor II

619
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:26,640
doctors from a single duty for late ride
up the middle lane to say traffic was

620
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,920
awful like

621
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,720
now I'm sober give me some whiskey that
may happen

622
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,230
but for now 10 in the morning I should
be sober

623
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,960
according to comes my permission up

624
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,490
up so the whole counterattack and I've

625
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,210
I've read papers for my voice about
self-defense I think

626
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:54,100
risk are if you do something really dumb
and macho like opt in I'll service

627
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,410
a to figure out like in the notebook
network mapping going of

628
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:01,950
I take pack row to row I get a reprieve
and that router happens to be

629
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:04,960
innocent can you drop fat you take out
other traffic

630
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,970
%ah its this is not

631
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,800
you know its same way as like firearm
self-defense I was justified

632
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,850
right and guess what we're gonna tear
you know we're going to win

633
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,819
we're going to examine your life for the
next year and a half and that's not fun

634
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,440
no one has fun in Cork

635
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,730
okay people like me have fun in court
but

636
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:27,100
what the two advantages one we're
getting paid

637
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:33,089
secondly we go home okay

638
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,610
I wanna kinda run to this I defender
hypothetical

639
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,950
on your end-user get on your system and
network admin or

640
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:44,590
IT security guy arm you get on from a
traffic from a pot

641
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,950
compact you're actively monitoring and
get the upstream if I don't do all the

642
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,150
traffic from the east

643
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:53,470
this bank if I peace drop just drop to
the router

644
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,750
that's okay I

645
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,620
if your ISP I and you're around entrap
you get here

646
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,700
known as an attack on either one of your
boxes compromise and spewing

647
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,830
packets are someone's attacking some of
the boxes that are on your network

648
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm actively monitoring

649
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,549
incoming outgoing traffic I think your
cakes you've got the provider fact got

650
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:16,830
the provider protection saying

651
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:22,140
I am using this prevent fraud on my
network are to protect my assets

652
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,810
op so

653
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,450
NU's defender in this case have
professional monitoring traffic

654
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:33,440
you can more more him much more detail
put that

655
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,570
employee contracts are the his hand
books

656
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,590
I if it's instead you like a small eyes
P

657
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:44,240
I am are your your you don't have a
direct contract with your end users say

658
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,100
for example your university you might
want to just have in the terms a service

659
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,810
by using our systems we

660
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,670
reserve the right to sniff packets
defender network just see it got its the

661
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,810
belt suspenders approach you can't come
to us

662
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,529
you have more protections just what
federal law house

663
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,880
okay ISP defender

664
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,450
you may have permission im on your own
traffic on their networks because it's

665
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,700
either in the Terms of Service

666
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,570
arts prevent fraud clause in 25 11
dumping traffic

667
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,230
there's no federal law that prevents you
from dumping traffic on your own network

668
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,810
because

669
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,850
it says youre not allowed intercepted it
doesn't say here

670
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:23,680
you have to route interception is I'm

671
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,140
looking at if you know if for example

672
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,750
yeah this packet goes by if I

673
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:35,330
look at the contents I'm committing
25-11 violation if I look at it go

674
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,840
I haven't read I have intercepted just
dumped

675
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,950
I'm safe okay

676
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:46,510
some dumb takeaways are protect yourself

677
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,680
protect your cock protect your
organization have modern causes

678
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,740
in contracts for clients end-users

679
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,710
whoever else and it's simple you can
have this is one little claws

680
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:02,190
in up you know the big terms a service
by using our site you get you know we

681
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,420
get to do this

682
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,310
seek to avoid mongering innocent traffic

683
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:10,730
I love writing one-line that's so

684
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,140
infinitely complex cos I can at least
the last time I checked

685
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,520
in TCP IP RTSP there is no flag for

686
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,520
in a sec and I'm sure someone will
eventually publish that

687
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:27,180
and I'll be you know april fools I'm
action against someone

688
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,859
someone to break the people bit housing
like that let's let's activate

689
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,880
you now and just asked if you're bought
her you just

690
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,460
evil bitch equals 1 thank you that's
great

691
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,890
ob and if happens I'll be perfectly safe
to send you could monitor

692
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,180
this on I'm

693
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,509
routing meditate is less protected than
the contents

694
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,820
so if you can't figure out some way of
sniffing just that you're better

695
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,550
protected

696
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,590
if you can figure out some metrics by
which you can determine

697
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,800
up bad packets

698
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,750
by doing that you're in a safer place
and you are a few actual to do content

699
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,520
analysis

700
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,950
and I'm also willing to bet that you
have some advantages if UK

701
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,000
by just employing the meta-data pulling
the headers

702
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,410
Northwest house so it's actually one of
those

703
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,149
I captured this faster so it might
actually be both legally and technically

704
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,030
easier

705
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:24,230
course I'm not gonna not think culture

706
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,830
I'm store communications protected
differently

707
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,120
i think thats less important for what
most botnet

708
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,540
defenders would deal with this you're
not actually polling you know there

709
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,570
there are going to be that many store
emails on a box you're hitting

710
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,850
arm but it may happen

711
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,970
are the biggest takeaway is
counterattacks are stupid

712
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:49,800
ob don't get macho its its cuz my my
biggest fear

713
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,750
is like you know the guy who came to me
two years ago and said

714
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:56,970
I'm pissing off Scott's imagine if you

715
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:00,200
you know counterattack

716
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,830
you do your counterattack against I
think this is a botnet

717
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:07,420
instead they they you know I did you
make a mistake or they did something he

718
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:07,880
puts

719
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,930
IP spoofing and you drop all

720
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,950
I don't know Department of Defense
website

721
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,400
this on the list a bad things that's on
the top of UK

722
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,810
you can interfer only are stupidly

723
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,740
really increase your problems it's like
firing wildly in a subway

724
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,830
to defend yourself against a marker
there may be easier ways

725
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:33,290
defending herself don't get you in more
trouble than start

726
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:39,190
of Wow

727
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:46,190
any questions

728
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,560
a second point a active but imminent
threat

729
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,640
so if your neighbor's house is on fire
you should be looked to put it out

730
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:10,600
out a the fire's heading your way aren't
but now it's like the wildfires via

731
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,950
internet and the third

732
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,610
question is a Good Samaritan laws and
also how that would

733
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,620
applied the situation I'm all through
this be good defenses

734
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,210
if your chart with you've done something
you shouldn't have

735
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,850
however that promises that no one's
effectively race those defenses

736
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:31,160
and on one one-piece advice is that

737
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,120
that's what we call precedent making
which sounds really cool

738
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,339
you get means you get half your man in
an opinion

739
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,360
that's bad for

740
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,290
for one problem half the time you lose
some and

741
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,279
you know the cow according to the you
know according to the Bob doctrine

742
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,630
and bop bop you know got to spend
obscene sums of money to get it up to

743
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:58,730
the appellate courts to make it an
opinion that will follow

744
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:01,990
arm you're right that the are potential
defenses

745
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:05,140
I think the Castle Doctrine will be
valid

746
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,580
I think arm I don't know about the how
the Good Samaritan

747
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:13,819
approach would work because you're a
third party you're completely out of it

748
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,660
arm but

749
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,680
the to to sum up the our defenses I

750
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,430
don't know how safe they are and I
hardly Rebecca recommend don't tried

751
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,770
let someone else do that protesting
minefields

752
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:35,770
you go ahead top I'll wait here else

753
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:48,820
okay

754
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:03,020
sorry you're right in the white so its
it's like that scene from poltergeist

755
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,040
about one stupid question

756
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:21,680
is there any way that we can get quote
unquote deputized

757
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,359
so that we have some kinda almost
private investigator or

758
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,799
a up greater than legal

759
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,349
