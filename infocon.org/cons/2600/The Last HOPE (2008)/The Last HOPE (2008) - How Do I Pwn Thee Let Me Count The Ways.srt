18
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,709
it's called how do I poem The let me
count the ways are all started out with

19
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:23,029
conversation I had with the game Dino
from South Africa and convention in

20
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:23,819

21
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,130
cult sect or both kinda noted that the

22
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,499
work for unit business workforce is on
the airline is increasingly mobile

23
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:33,889
increasingly what using

24
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:37,539
and relying on wireless devices ands

25
00:01:37,539 --> 00:01:41,590
mostly these people you know by and
large can be

26
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:46,929
telescopes so there's an of a lot of
opportunities for these people tuned

27
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,599
you know make here view of each john
Payne

28
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:54,169
difficult because they're away from
young your

29
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,729
ability to smack him around and enforce
the rules they can

30
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,209
the same things they can do stupid
things and

31
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:04,569
it's actually yeah rather terrifying you
look at it

32
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:07,799
how on easy these people can you sir

33
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,050
all the security measures have been in
place I

34
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,250
this is by no means an exhaustive list
if you have any suggestions at the end

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,160
and love to hear I'm on and as for a
full disclosure

36
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,100
I will say that there is probably not
any terribly new wireless content in

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,549
here

38
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,950
there's it's just her accumulation
earning

39
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,080
probably some things they Ewing's you

there's no justice in I'm sure many of
you know

96
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,630
hot spots generally do not encrypt
connecting in a

97
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,800
you know what's funny Starbucks are
eating deer

98
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,870

now it's a service by is a service that

100
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,210
anybody can see it's clear text anybody
can see if they can see which are

101
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,909
transmitting

102
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:26,740
it's like SSL VPN or something like that
the other thing is

103
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,720
they're also free to inject because I
can see what you're looking for

104
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,650
and do interesting things to respond to
that if you're not using the piano when

105
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,050
these hot spots in your company day
going over

106
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,880
you're screwed beginning and you got
company secrets

107
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,900
going through the air to anybody within
range

108
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,340
mom probably doesn't know this blog is
probably

109
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,030
more worried about the fact that you can
you know get his email from his a

110
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,960
frickin serial access 1.6 go with them

111
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,669
and not thinking about the company's
assets

112
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,530
and I thinking about the fact he's got
this database sitting there

113
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,080
on an open share on his computer that
onji

114
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,169
I he doesn't have fire anybody who's on
the local and

115
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:14,070
also connect the access point announced
are browsing

116
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,460
shares and fuji look customer list

117
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,130
costing products could be very
interesting other people

118
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,590
particularly if this happens sitting in
an airport departure lounge easier

119
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,229
competitions that across the way

120
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:30,419
you know the usual

121
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,099
man in the middle attacks aspirin
starving all that's applicable

122
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,360
but really telling example

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,750
is at DEFCON 15 last year

124
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,990
there's about twenty access points a
couple days before the caucuses by

125
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,700
twenty access points they were

126
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,060
had the SSID love the hotel's network

127
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,810
by Saturday night there was a 150

128
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,409
recently Russian roulette with that

129
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:02,530
how do you know that the access point
you're connecting to is actually

130
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,830
the hotel one and not somebody just
doing something nasty

131
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,650
most is hot spots don't do any
authentication

132
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,010
you know they might ask you for your
name and password by

133
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,140
you know there's nothing there if I know
certificate coming back saying

134
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:19,150
yes this is me this issue an actual
Intel network

135
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:22,360
no verification that and

136
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,970
best you might see poets mac Address
it's written on she

137
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,620
room I can be easily spoofed air on

138
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,078
no such a thing the attackers on your
local network

139
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,620
he's sitting right next to you for all
intensive purposes

140
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,698
if you don't have a firewall upper
anything like that it's like a guy

141
00:08:40,698 --> 00:08:42,419
sitting in a cubicle next to bob

142
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,430
back it to you widgets international so

143
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,860
all the attacks the you can be mitigated
by fire suddenly

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,920
I and its name to speaker

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,140
things like the dryer abilities come out
recently that

146
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,689
you for knows when fresh
telecommunication thats

147
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,930
whereas in Norway

148
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,230
for a conference back in February um

149
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,079
I am basically had the worst travel
experience possible

150
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:14,490
between cancel flights you know
airplanes and in turn around cuz

151
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,930

after been flying for an hour in this
thing just

153
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,160
wasn't a pleasant experience I'll so
I've been up for like

154
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,280
36 hours or so before I got to the
conference in

155
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,810
the time zone change ok I got there just
at the very beginning the day

156
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,890
all I'm gonna and you get tired yet
punchy

157
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:41,329
let's start doing some experimentation
so I wanted to see if

158
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,560
other countries I experimented North
America

159
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,000
gonna see if other countries and
continents heads now

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,949
enough wherewithal to realize that maybe
they should be using open networks at

161
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,410
conferences where there's no

162
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,800
have to speaking rosters and all hackers
that good after on and

163
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,329
you know under assumed names or anything
like that so

164
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:06,709
yeah let's see if these people really
figured out soon I fired up here at home

165
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:10,530
which and a Half Men you know
essentially when you make a

166
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,180
request for see Google you get the the
HTP get get request

167
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,150
for the image on the front page now
that'll take

168
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,270
like two hundred milliseconds to get
there to animal seconds back

169
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,410
if I'm in the same room as you and your
running on an uninterrupted network

170
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,709
I can see this get request and with any
luck

171
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,900
supply my own image back fudging that
it's coming from

172
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,350
Google and feedback to you and process
oh this must be

173
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,510
damage than I was expecting and put up

174
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:46,510
but every minutes this is the first
image I started injecting

175
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,600
and energy and tell them that's a
10-foot kayak net wealth

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,730
shark if that is a poner know what does

177
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,790
hardly noticed

178
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:03,000
um most people didn't actually look at
the image they just saw

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,460
this blue thing it an early look at it
it's been a time on it

180
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:10,380
arms a lot I like okay what's going on
bankrupted images

181
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,700
now at this conference they had three
networks running

182
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,740
one was running open one was running
back one is running wk

183
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,910
now I own

184
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,959
I was wondering traffic for two days the
conference

185
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,940
I only saw Truong against you WV a
network

186
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,400
and one other suppliers verified is
actually for maintenance to go and

187
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,580
double check was actually running
because nobody is connecting

188
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,220
so everybody was using the open network

189
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,400
and its okay after the first day

190
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,680
lets up the ante with see what you know
if these people actually figure out that

191
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,580
maybe somebody

192
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,580
possibly be screened for network now

193
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,850
traffic camera to take a picture started
up you know

194
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:02,459
injecting that they got their hands

195
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:06,589
and get punched there are some people
coming up to me you're the only got the

196
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:07,220
call for

197
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,779
webmail open and they're looking at like
what are you doing

198
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,860
how are you getting into mine laptop
what are you doing to me like what did I

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,839
do to you

200
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,860
and like can I talk I'll explain

201
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,060
um actually a hundred and I'm

202
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,380
from the Tor project intent head asked
me to continue doing this in the rest

203
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,170
the weekend because it fit very nicely

204
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,680
his talk about or and how it can
actually used to mitigate against

205
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,680
something like this

206
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,380
but in this particular case I'm just
injecting my face

207
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,680
what else can I inject javascripts

208
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,209
change DNS entries now

209
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,740
Nick the classic one that to an airplane
region starting with was injecting goat

210
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,810
C&F

211
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,180
said yeah yeah an actual you

212
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,540
I confuse a lot of people people things
DNS poisoning

213
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,300
or something like that in think actual
like little man in the middle

214
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,950
through the air and fact this is a valid
attack

215
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,579
vectors still is kinda scary and the
people using an opener

216
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:13,120
um carmen is another one that

217
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,490
can turn around and bites you RF is
everything ok are

218
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,300
little bit essentially what it is

219
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,040
when laptop with windows or whatever is
trying to connect to you

220
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,550
is it arranger its home networks

221
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,070
there's that preferred list this as your
automatically connect to

222
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,220
whenever you're in range what sitting
there buchanan looking for these

223
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,970
networks

224
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,940
karma says ok that's where there's an IP

225
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,360
here's how to connect and generally

226
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,800
it well you know a couple so now I got a
direct connection to you

227
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
is now I'm on the local network arm

228
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,459
parts water does the same thing that in
any lights

229
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,649
pay-for-play access points presents your
nice

230
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,810
Morgan Page that menace what has some
new tools for this

231
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,490
stuff on simple nomad

232
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,600
has a hair to three years ago

233
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,910
to a talk at Shinnecock up fears had a
talk called hacking the friendly skies

234
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:14,860
for you pointed out

235
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,730
your 30,000 feet and sending mail to
move away from

236
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,480
any other sources of interference yes
the stewardesses tell you turn off your

237
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,390
wireless but

238
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,779
you know they could have been first
class since bought sitting there typing

239
00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:28,570
random letters something like that

240
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,110
doesn't necessarily listen to that or
necessarily know how to turn off the

241
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:33,900
wireless

242
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,190
so he setting up their broadcasting
looking for networks

243
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,329
when he was gonna find 30,000 feet
except for the guy

244
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:45,490
back in economy who fires on car or
something like that and connects

245
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,500
up to nine first-class for now is your
present shares oh you know this guy

246
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,949
works for this company

247
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:55,290
ok here's our customer database soldiers
a a memo

248
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,569
went around to some that and our favs

249
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,290
seen simple nomad that he's not the
kinda guy you expect wheres

250
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,839
and all the time don't think Juan Pierre
I'll

251
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,690
drink I but just not yet not

252
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,660
you know what I bought as usual and
people he deals with some supplies some

253
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,160
great stories about going up into the
game first class and

254
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,630
the laptop hey pop how's it going on
your how's the kids you know

255
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,250
what did you get that memo about that
saying in an skies looking in San

256
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,160
who are you how do you know all this

257
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,360
just scaring the crap outta this guy and
get think about it

258
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,829
even at 30,000 feet where erecting only
supposed to be broadcasting Wireless

259
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,610
something probably is and could be
exploited

260
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:48,390
when the best stories ever heard was
from the minors

261
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:52,050
pen testing for a living and he was
talking about that they were flying out

262
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,180
to a

263
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,649
customer site to do in on it the

264
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:02,709
K skating one of the top people from
that site to there are going to be when

265
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:03,620
the top execs

266
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,440
after Beyonce flights I can see from the
flying first class

267
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,709
on the connected to his laptop

268
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,410
and all the flights and what are the pre
hacked so that when he walked into the

269
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:15,270
corporate network

270
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:20,339
you create a back door for them so
before leaving landed and compromise the

271
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,100
sites

272
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,120
yeah it's

273
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:32,120
absolute terrifying to think this is
possible as a cafe want to exploit which

274
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,350
even if you're not connected to the
corporate network and vulture wept year

275
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,750
for

276
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,310
some stupid reason you're still running
with a corporate network so if I know

277
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,850
that ball

278
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,420
works for which is international night I
live in the same town as their their

279
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,160
headquarters and I wanna do something
bad

280
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,189
I target blog get the key in and then
walk on the governor

281
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:53,280
samples at you know 0 the authentication
at

282
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,029
the authentication headaches on the
contents to

283
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:02,640
some guidance for 111 and decay or
something like that

284
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,919
starts do-nothing everything care thats
mormon annoyance situation than anything

285
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,970
but provinces Chizik to work

286
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,310
generally if your wireless is on your
portable in one way or another

287
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,869
driver explain action exploits something

288
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,439
particularly on the road near Knotts at
a corporate network that can

289
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,150
you can't do wth radius over a hot spot
it's

290
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:31,560
Starbucks you can be can and knows well

291
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,570
skinny to see the wifi when not in use

292
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,889
simple thing you guys going on there
turn off an airplane because I don't

293
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,560
think limousine crash

294
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,230
um use a VPN for everything

295
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,260
assume you're being attacked

296
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,070
there so if there's a bunch of different
products other than give you indications

297
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,010
that weight something stinky here

298
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,290
access point just change channels in the
in the mac Address Changer something

299
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,830
weird like that

300
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,980
no good products to investigate to put
on bob's laptop so what's up the big

301
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,300
sign saying hey you're

302
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:10,360
under attack stop doing anything
confidential

303
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,100
don't trust customer networks either
actually earn a couple stories where

304
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,540
they were customers were

305
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,260
sales guys going out customer networks
our customer sites

306
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,980
and say oh I need to get some
information from the yeah the corporate

307
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,940
network and then

308
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,070
walking in contact corporate and
bringing something down

309
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,800
was sitting there connected to the
customer's network in the classroom you

310
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,590
really interested to know exactly how
much margin is on all these widgets

311
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,899
so if they were real contractor
something like that they could

312
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,169
CRC she often just you know those are
the games

313
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,490
if you've got like an open share
something like that sitting on me

314
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,790
on the laptop planted in a into it.i

315
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:55,030
interest to see a new host an hour
what's that all this is interesting

316
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,260
oh there's a lot more money in this
contract and you're getting for hitler's

317
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,270
no at another zeroed in the contract

318
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:05,010
on turn on firewalls be cautious

319
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,530
tori is a really useful tool to have
handy for this

320
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,960
is if you catch yourself having to use a
hot spot outside in the office or

321
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,370
something like that

322
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,559
wit or does it increase from your laptop

323
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:21,300
over the wireless connection to a tauren
point and then

324
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,389
you know here your connection pop at my
career

325
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,240
Germany or someplace like that and then
go for the

326
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:35,240
the actual content and come back to the
same way s

327
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,830
arming not that I know if specifically

328
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:51,760
of he was basically asking about

329
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,290
Google having a similar tool that
alleged to anonymizer trap and

330
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,870
increase your traffic first of basically
anything that

331
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,240
would do that would mitigate lotteries
attacks because you're not seeing

332
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,020
their text go through you can inject a
camp ascertain

333
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,610
from that yes they're still born to Lisa
toward

334
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,170
you know you have to trust your endpoint
is that's coming out against me

335
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,630
sniffing that by really you're not
protecting the actual

336
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,490
content going through just only on that
link between you and the access point

337
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,780
star X let's go after his phone

338
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,220

seem like they've got their phone

340
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,480
permanently welded to the cider their
head and you really really hope these

341
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,280
things actually get brain cancer if your
number I merely

342
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,560
have the sales guys the WiFi Bluetooth
headset permanently well to their

343
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:54,429
I'm review this thanks much as I do
let's

344
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,830
again I'll Bob loves it

345
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,280
he's got its handsets he's got his phone
is

346
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,040
bank every time it is transaction online
sends him a one-time

347
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,550
passcode overs as an ass he then asked
enter to you

348
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,760
verify the transaction really reasonable
system elsa keeps you know

349
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,040
Cup private company information on his
phone directory listings

350
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,200
thats first typically find have

351
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,890
now Bluetooth if

352
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:31,100
the phone is gonna discoverable it's
probably got a default plan on it

353
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,180
I'm you change your default in have you
had

354

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:47,940
basically an ally cases parent devices
can get full access to

356
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,550
the other device so if i pair my phone
with yours

357
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:56,399
my phone explicitly as full access to
your phone not just

358
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,750
for opec's exchanging business cards and
things like that its

359
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,340
the whole shebang why I need that much
access

360
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know so if I can convince your
parents

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,490
iPhone for whatever reason I can make

362
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,050
rewrite to the SMS messages you insert
sim

363
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,250
nasty things about Bob's wife in phone

364
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,360
pull out those one-time can numbers

365
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,770
now PCM online doing is this transaction
ideals

366
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,510
thank something before talk to the
couple people who audit systems like

367
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,350
this and they had to basically it's

368
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,930
sneak a sniffer into the office and wait
for

369
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,120
executive who's normal things to check

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,550
bank accounts at for the in today to get

371
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,149
the code and prove to him that he yup
there's a portion is looped it is normal

372
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,770
that I can

373
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,230
getting get this Pasco gets the website
and do something before you did

374
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:56,180
on

375
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,260
some models phone if you can act on it
it's her from

376
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,650
17 1017 you actually get a

377
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,230
an 80 command prompt

378
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:09,750
like the old modem AT commands you can
issue

379
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:14,370
commands directly to the phone this gets
interesting he started flying into

380
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,990
things like premium recalls

381
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,440
1 900 numbers and stuff like that
because barnas to explain the nine our

382
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,420
faculty matter

383
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,740
it's a lot fun time party-line on the
company dime so

384
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,300
and video here that's explains

385
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:36,300
if we've got you know what here there

386
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,230
I are you not coming

387
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,300
ever

388
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,260
sources have reported that Britney's in
the greater the high tech crime wave

389
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,560
one of the latest targets is one of our
closest friends

390
00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:00,560
the mobile phones sensation just nurse

391
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,260
experts have discovered a security flaw
in some of the most popular

392
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,940
bluetooth-enabled phones

393
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,700
that allows others to hack into your
handset and take control events

394
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,520
our house lets a go to demonstrate for a
hidden cameras just how vulnerable your

395
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,910
phone conveyed to assign

396
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,940
two times this is the Bluetooth scam

397
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,220
the problem with some places fans as you
can make unauthorized intervention to

398
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,910
the phone

399
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:29,250
affect they take over the phone read the
contents

400
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,350
answer the phone book SMS messages

401
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,910
even that she make calls with it so how
does the Bluetooth hot work

402
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,380
our host is going to demonstrate to hear
just some polls phones have the

403
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,830
Bluetooth turned on

404
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,939
Alex uses his mobile Pocket PC because
the security flaw in Jess's phone

405
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,210
he's able to locate the Bluetooth SIG
pack directly into the onset

406
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,200
and take control of its now you can make
a call from Jess's phone to polls found

407
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,410
this technique is known as blue jacking
these bitches hustles

408
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,600
I works by using the Bluetooth feature
on

409
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,760
mobile phones so very modern very useful

410
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,400
very easy piece of technology they can
connect to your phone

411
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,809
without you knowing it your phone will
not even show

412
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:22,830
that it's connected to something and I
was ready to test it to the public

413
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:28,559
alex is set his pocket competed to
search for Bluetooth signals

414
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,110
now he's composed the mom

415
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,260
enable concepts you can come for the hot

416
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,760
now he's in the making cool he's in the
marks phone

417
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,790
but what is the actual scam here it's in
the number the alex is calling from

418
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,799
Oxfam

419
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,200
how host the success of the run premium
rate line the calls are charged with one

420
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,490
count 15 minutes

421
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,809
so these guys have the money taken from
the property

422
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,918
but he's totally oblivious and if the
market doesn't realize his phones

423
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,919
cordless the premium

424
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:04,130
should be shared between Manchester and
Liverpool he will lose

425
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,350
75 pounds he call charges couch

426
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:12,940
so if Alex spend some time here he can
really take on that I killed

427
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,410
in an hour munchies to target twenty
funds within public school

428
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,480
on the 15 minutes making from a clients
house with five hundred pounds

429
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,410
how was this a proof for those with the
technology and know-how

430
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,000
this is a really money-spinning scam the
simplest and best way to protect itself

431
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
against the scams is

432
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,120
just simply to keep leeches tend of the
less you actually using it

433
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,480
if you do not switch off the ball to
feature on your phone when you're not

434
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,150
using it

435
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:45,150
you're in danger if somebody finding a
way

436
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,549
so president-elect's from Britain

437
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:51,918
but and would you know there's so much
more popular since

438
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,100
it's absolutely crazy today gets the
point across the you set up a phone

439
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,610
number

440
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:01,179
online you know some namely nobody's
ever gonna

441
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,400
won a contest these its own harassing
just gonna pay it

442
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,250
burly Maker Faire money and that's and
I'm terrified thing is that he's

443
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,600
and decides who's going to be able to
prove that

444
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,919
you know wasn't of it actually made that
phone call there was somebody else

445
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:18,150
control involves phone

446
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,410
for Bluetooth rats

447
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,080
center and headsets most handsets don't
have

448
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,980
any sort of influence they don't have a
screen don't have one or two buttons

449
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,419
so the only pin number that is necessary
to connect

450
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,350
is built and its 0000 or 1234

451
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,730
there's no way change that's so

452
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,750
you can use certain attacks like blue
while which one disconnect the headset

453
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:47,559
from the phone

454
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:50,559
in IMAX if we go back into discoverable
mode

455
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,440
you could then connect the headset and
turn around and start

456
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,370
listening to Bob conversations or
fueling really mean

457
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,080
start injecting audio this also applies
to

458
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,178
car built in car handsets resistant
stereo system to

459
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,540
today which is so you can imagine if
you're following along behind Paul

460
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:16,040
his CT over there conversation you can
really have a bug in that car by

461
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,120
connecting to the

462
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,820
Bluetooth headset built-in and wasn't
back in the car

463
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,399
3 expect now

464
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,650
you can all I i've seen as number times
where somebody will go into a

465
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,120
board meeting or something take other
phone turn it off a courtesy

466
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,110
the return of the headset I'll take it
off but in a park here

467
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,600
just leave it on and look for Lisa
Ling's thinking liked

468
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,840
distracts everybody says but think about
him if this thing is going back to

469
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,350
discoverable mode it's a

470
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:52,850
little Park its bug in the border in
broadcasting everything that said

471
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,220
and I know there's some military
specifications and say that you're in a

472
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,380
class by meeting

473
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,250
or something that you've take your phone
out take the battery out and put it in

474
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:02,880
front of you

475
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,530
I cannot find correct me if I'm wrong
but I cannot find any regulations they

476
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,110
talk about

477
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:14,750
headsets begins on one hand since you
can't take the battery out

478
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,140
but I i really like the idea of
injecting you because

479
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,080
there are so many people who you get the
schizophrenic

480
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,240
situations and now you really like to
call you

481
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:33,240
religion is situations yen up with

482
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,040
area gonna

483
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:45,040
on so what are you doing tonight

484
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,039
up

485
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:50,799
nothing you want to go to a party me
yeah I just got my paper for

486
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,810
and hang out yet that sounds awesome
hold on

487
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,960
but you can always be smooth for UPS
should

488
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,080
with the special I can see on the texts
Keystone Light is always

489
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,520
even when you're not and the cycle it
just happened ok let's close down there

490
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:14,750
okay I hate headsets

491
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,840
and why I have one for when I'm driving
by

492
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,040
you put it online major call using of
its when you're standing condone it to

493
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,879
something like that

494
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,340
like flashing units like how special are
you that you have to get that phone call

495
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,730
in the next five seconds

496
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,040
to take things off please girls I have
this dream of being able to do this

497
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,720
on mass absolutely love to to find the
car

498
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,030
room for bankers or something like that
some big meeting disconnect on the

499
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,930
phones connected to other handsets
months ago

500
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,410
I know where you get the money desi
rights

501
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,390
for that and they're just

502
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:55,710
rattler cager this is a new addition

503
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,420
for emerging through Bob's phone in a

504
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,510
as SMS is we find some certain messages
that

505
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,370
get our interest his number these
messages have

506
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,340
a five digits number prefix and

507
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,610
judging by the content within the mess
in you can probably figure out

508
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,000
devices there are some things

509
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,200
she just not be wirelessly enabled the

510
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,020
by default according to manufacture
these devices are not discoverable

511
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:34,020
by who thought this was a good idea we
figured it out yet

512
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,400
a bluetooth-enabled vibrator it pairs
with a cell phone

513
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,670
and as it receives the specially coded
text messages each character in the

514
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,370
message

515
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:59,370
creates a certain motion just continuing
to run away

516
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,879
in

517
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,280
now %ah

518
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,970
here well you're

519
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,970
any suggestions

520
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,910
night basically telling the onyx

521
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:27,580
which is the study like long-distance
axe seriously they have not looked at

522
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:33,449
security in like cases its kinda
terrifying this is Ken extreme example

523
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,529
bad idea

524
00:32:36,529 --> 00:32:42,070
in

525
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:48,450
who seriously that think about it

526
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,380
if they haven't spent time thinking
about security they think that this is

527
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,620
just a a good idea for you

528
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,380
some serve remote stimulation what about
you

529
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,330
we're hijacked moms phone and send
messages on his behalf or

530
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,420
if we're near enough to his wife you can
connect to the device directly

531
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,150
and send messages ourselves doesn't
count as a sexual assault

532
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,350
what implication is that have if

533
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,960
oh honey thanks for sending that message
at 7 p.m. last night guidance and

534
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,670
I think about what would that do to
relationships

535
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,790
I can get really awkward your and
probably disastrous

536
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:30,370
I'm just thinking from purely technical
standpoint if it's reacting to it

537
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,370
characters email and SMS whatever
non-printing characters

538
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,380
control characters things like that is
there the possibility for

539
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:45,140
physical harm or something like this:
now

540
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,720
I'm adding that to the previous Ryan

541
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,510
plethora this is

542
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:55,940
actually something to consider me and
we're moving into an era where that were

543
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,610
on that

544
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,070
really slick slope of the curve day

545
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,450
this technology showing up and all over
the place that

546
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:10,440
should this be wirelessly enable recess
we ask that question it might seem like

547
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,500
a good idea but

548
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,600
no isn't to say I would love if somebody
could leak from the cash to get many

549
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,650
things in Chi

550
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,130
and shut up yeah

551
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:29,540
no up its only especially in different
wireless villagers something like this

552
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,389
tear apart was it like to see what the
implications are on this

553
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:37,730
I think I should be very telling to see

554
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,320
how this other new field hands is not
thought about security

555
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,350
and stop

556
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:50,110
Bluetooth rights in general just turn
off Bluetooth like how do you use

557
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,620
bluetooth on a regular basis

558
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,549
I'm you find you have really crappy
battery life

559
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,980
you to turn off the glitches new
apparently

560
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,530
you're not using it then just turn

561
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:05,760
change the default pin if you can some

562
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,790
new handsets you guys should look into
USB and actually

563
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,410
interact with them and change the band's
but in general most handsets

564
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,460
it to default and like Motorola has done
where

565
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,560
it's only discoverable and will accept
connections when you've held down the

566
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,810
button for a few seconds

567
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,480
and it puts in discover mode for 60
seconds if possible

568
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,810
limit access to you what parts and
advice

569
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:33,140
you know connected device can get to you
does somebody need access to your

570
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,410
phonebook if you're just trying to
exchange a business card

571
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,700
your SMS's or something like that can
limit exactly what they're capable

572
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,920
you won't have nearly as much fear if
somebody is using its

573
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,600
and just in general cancer the security
implications of green spaces into you

574
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,920
possibly secure environment I know

575
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,810
like government no injuries from without
at this point is probably some companies

576
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,520
that at and hopefully talks like this
will get

577
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:07,520
some attention just after skis

578
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,360
of as well as RFID approx carter's
office

579
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,780
carries in a lanyard sitting on his belt
see along with this is

580
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,770
you on the other side it is picture ID
home

581
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:21,680
if you really want an interesting talk
to her joining long to know tech

582
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,879
as a whole section on being named for a
group photograph

583
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,520
and replicate use bhajans you know

584
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,680
how many actually use these in the
office and have them

585
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,910
excessive all the time i mean you know
that

586
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,509
a lot others if you haven't set them up
and over the last five years

587
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,610
their legacy system can be easily clone
to fear

588
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,550
CQ dots CX on don't unless you still to
any device is actually just his

589
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:53,740
to first-person is actually refined
beyond

590
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,860
essentially what it is you push one
button it

591
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,370
we even found an RFID tag copies the
number

592
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:05,500
where's the other one emulated read it
back so I just go up in behind the

593
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,200
boss you know that the head of the
company or

594
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,500
the other person entire access to a
building Jenner

595
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:17,130
of hey how you doing a good job P and
I'm risky

596
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,140
I got in the door be lets me n

597
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,250
that tired team kinda stuff

598
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:28,410
and suddenly the boss is going into the
office at three o'clock in the morning

599
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:28,850
I'm

600
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:32,480
rummaging around in the R&D department
everything went right back to you

601
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,700
now this is where you need to have all
the factors

602
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,040
indication if you have a security guard
standing there to do that see somebody

603
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,390
doesn't recognize using bosses I D you
know they they might actually stop

604
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,140
provided this notice some minimum-wage
job works there show

605
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,629
traditional keys are vulnerable to

606
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,130
is a lot of people have their RFID bad
still have their

607
00:37:55,130 --> 00:38:01,430
ID badge and the lanyard the keys on it
photographing these keys

608
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,020
if you can do it surreptitiously can
actually reveal what the bidding hands

609
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,340
and how to replicate these kids if you
know

610
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,530
the kind of walked in the door
searchlight wiser

611
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,460
pick set Iran whatever you can

612
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,890
actually photographed and see the
building that the bombs on a key

613
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,470
and no what the companies for that or
this gets really interesting and you

614
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,840
start involving things like

615
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,110
safety democracy with the the mall now

616
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,990
the EXR name houses

617
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,760
from your election system assessment arm

618
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,020
they got caught with their pants down a
couple years ago where through their

619
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,690
online store you can order

620
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,740
additional keys for medieval machines
but this is the actual photo

621
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,880
that's the actual bidding on every p

622
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,140
for every machine out there and it was
on their web store

623
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,650
so what happened was this guy saw
necessary

624
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,270
I recognizes keys that's the same as
when we used to use the many bars in the

625
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,360
hotel used to work at I don't have a few
blanks around take

626
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,970
you know gets the plank stays in with as
many it's on a file

627
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,180
files down what he thinks is the
approximation sends it to some these

628
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,960
guys doing on its own these machines

629
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,970
and

630
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:19,790
on the whole thing

631
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:23,220
as for user now

632
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,710
this is the key that ever up from the
mall

633
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:33,710
and got first right that's the memory
card access line they get access to the

634
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:38,359
america this was all the votes

635
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:42,290
bombs passports

636
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:46,640
on travels internationally alive there's
some implications particularly

637
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,240
he's got the new RFID passports which
have this little ongoing

638
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,480
I'm you have this most

639
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,580
few here you will basically is no way to
know what get one in the near future

640
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,000
is there federally-mandated it's the new
design

641
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,780
the encryption on these things is not
very strange there also

642
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,390
very easily read the tinfoil hats

643
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,680
solution they came up sleep with these
out for

644
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,680
like a request comments

645
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,100
there's like 2000 comments

646
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:25,000
all against Stanley to in Fort so
whether compromise was okay slap the

647
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,670
RFID

648
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:28,920
will put the middle for a layer in the
front and back cover

649
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,070
now the seems like a good idea

650
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:40,070
except that it's self-defeating I think
NC

651
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,820
but on the corner um the passport with
the metal foil want

652
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:49,370
naturally most pop open about an inch
which is enough

653
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:54,700
to read the data from it so their tin
foil hats

654
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,450
actually is self-defeating because
eating increases the

655
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,170
the stiffness and the cover and natural
gas to pop open

656
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:05,400
so and just

657
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,560
on that once again Nancy he pushes it
down

658
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,410
the data stream stops now is reading

659
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:16,120
stops passers reading

660
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,210
ever sat down again it stops so

661
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,410
if you've got this thing up her surlis
pocket or something like that

662
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:27,799
the whole point in the taxes then tin
foil hat

663
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,240
not be able to be read to have the best
for not be able to read until it's

664
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,890
actually presented at a border

665
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:39,950
is negated um there's all sorts in

666
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:44,980
implications and and conspiracy theories
about the R&D in the passports after

667
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,300
that

668
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,750
this is a very short range on these
things so it's not listening to me

669
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,400
reading

670
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,200
you know across this research thing
actually right next to you the

671
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,170
encryption

672
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,190
could be better they say it's a

673
00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:01,180
family wonky except that they're using
factors like the passport number

674
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:06,009
which are sequential for states which is
a very limited his face

675
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,890
and other bits of information that you
can really narrow down the available

676
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,440
mackey space on these things

677
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,470
the %uh thing that is interest actually
talk to the number two man in charge in

678
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,350
passports

679
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:21,190
with the US State Department there is
actually no

680
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:26,050
rule that says if you're RFID enabled
passports RFID chip doesn't work

681
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,420
that they have to refuse you access to
the border get increased scrutiny

682
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,890
that is still a valid legal document for

683
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:37,589
its when the ten years down here carats
five

684
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,800
for 10 years that at that

685
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,410
ask for still good even if they are but
he doesn't work so liberal application

686
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:45,470
about Hannah

687
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,650
you know in negate wanted the the
possible

688
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:54,920
issues with this I felt really hard

689
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,630
here

690
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,110
net on the other thing is that

691
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,710
the a conspiracy theory is that oh
they'll be able to pick Americans at a

692
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,670
crowd for bar

693
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:11,410
suicide bombings and stuff like this if
anybody's ever traveled

694
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:15,490
internationally to on corners in the
world you can generally find that

695
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,840
most Westerners tend to stick out like a
sore thumb up so

696
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:22,750
I don't need to see your passports know
that you're probably not from around

697
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,310
here

698
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:27,590
so of his other duties

699
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,140
like probably a lot on the salesman he
works trade ships of sales to be

700
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:36,120
a depend on demos being available
working properly

701
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:41,259
showing that a wonderfully are what
happens if you have

702
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:45,570
widgets that are you know wirelessly
controlled with

703
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:49,650
unauthenticated on a trip to commence
don't try this at home disease guys

704
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,650
actually got banned muscles focus

705
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,010
is about making sure that we did devices

706
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:01,350
Fukushima I am muscles focus

707
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,430
is my muscles focus

708
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,799
is about making sure that we did devices

709
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,560
who can she and you just like humans

710
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:20,560
means discount

711
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,329
now

712
00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:28,440
pics

713
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,440
the

714
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:47,510
tomorrow

715
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:52,269
on

716
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:56,099
cynicism dancing girls keep doing things
that he's

717
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:03,099
well we just get things together

718
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,890
well you know the Sri moving in today

719
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:14,299
going reso group with the same page
let's take a look at what he does and

720
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:19,680
what he sees any

721
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,140
Thursday

722
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:33,140
picture

723
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,450
you

724
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:40,880
three

725
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,120
here

726
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,089
me

727
00:45:46,089 --> 00:45:53,089
you

728
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,650
sweet

729
00:45:55,650 --> 00:46:00,070
go now

730
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:05,170
that was Gizmodo going to CES show back
in January and make magazine a game in

731
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,060
hand for TVB ons

732
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,549
so infrared something we all know

733
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:15,030
and this was you the year if the
television so there's like plasma nancy

734
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:16,369
is everywhere

735
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:20,339
and his I L all these guys wanna show
off how wonderful their product is

736
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:24,810
by if he keeps turning off and randomly
failing makes you wonder how many sales

737
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:27,089
they may have lost because it's
something like that

738
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:30,810
after I don't encouraging me and try
this because

739
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:34,359
you're looking at Motorola guy is
standing there trying to you

740
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:37,520
do his job sell his product and

741
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,050
some kind of Ambrose screwing around
it's like that's

742
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:44,900
this is not cool I'm sorry mean the
quality knees

743
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,339
okay that's something that you actually
causing so many grief and

744
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:54,509
you know possible lost sales stuff like
that that's just like a shirt sorry now

745
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:58,300
if you're also debt ratio typically
these guys will have

746
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,040
laptops with them for demos Center say

747
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:08,029
situation I found myself in I actually
gone a few years ago and unknown vendor

748
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:08,609
had

749
00:47:08,609 --> 00:47:11,910
a laptop showing off their product key
very expensive

750
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:17,000
product I'll I standing in line waiting
for registration starts

751
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,420
ands I get more easily

752
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,880
and I'm standing there me for
registration no and

753
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,950
like looking at their product and what's
interesting at

754
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,589
these will USB hubs that they're giving
me the light of

755
00:47:30,589 --> 00:47:35,060
again on the Z chained together and the
need to provide power to show that they

756
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,250
lineup and planted demo laptop

757
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,200
so I Fisher in my pocket and I find

758
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,339
that I have my USB switch plate with me
I'll

759
00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:50,460
basically what this does is upon
insertion and an XP system

760
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,650
earlier in auto executes and don'ts

761
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,540
all the passwords tune drive are memory

762
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:01,970
and basically runs like a see the
Autorite so

763
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,660
had a couple friends distracted the
sales guy

764
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:10,310
they got all these homes there click
click

765
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,049
ahead and tire dump all the passwords
and system on here

766
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,880
I'm not content to just go neener neener
neener

767
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:23,270
now but I got I go for sure if you're
gonna make a point you gotta make a

768
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:27,290
so are on a projector on

769
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,529
to belong scrub the passers isn't so I a
cup first couple characters are not

770
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:36,060
complete jerk I'll part objector

771
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:39,470
laptop the booth next to them

772
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,520
was this guy down here actually we

773
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,210
spun around where signs and used it as a
screen and proceeded to project the

774
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:48,349
passwords on

775
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:51,550
the screen right beside the within the
unnamed company

776
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:55,040
and then I stood up on a chair and
basically made the pronouncement that

777
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,509
ladies and gentlemen remember you are
the security conference and you have to

778
00:48:58,510 --> 00:48:59,660
secure ports

779
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,779
not just your network ports but your USB
ports and proceeded to explain when I'm

780
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,250
done

781
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,310
best part was that the woman is manning
the booth at the time covert and

782
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:12,549
actually gone up to launch

783
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,930
and warrior don't connect to the network

784
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:19,990
evil hackers around here you don't know
what they'll do you think as his laptop

785
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,480
I got

786
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,619
its lesson learned she basically

787
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:29,790
had to report back there was an incident
but it was it was a marketing laptop so

788
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:31,730
they were doing it right was marking
laptop

789
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,589
before guy connects it back to corporate
america got scrubbed so

790
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:39,020
the only thing is on there was like his
personal search for earth-like MSN

791
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,829
and stuff like that but you have to
think that a lot of these passwords were

792
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:43,690
identical

793
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,030
for various uses when he's got the
radically also

794
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:50,530
cover corporates assets to so

795
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:54,310
even though he never actually touched
think the corporate network there's

796
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:59,619
yeltsin conjecture you can make a that
on the major repercussions on this was

797
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:02,329
that the guy had to admit publicly that
he had done this

798
00:50:02,329 --> 00:50:06,940
and got known on your side where big
foam cowboy hat for an entire day as

799
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,040
punishment to your

800
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,580
so worried about

801
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,730
on his laptop on his data a cell phone

802
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,730
upon his wife his keys

803
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:22,690
demos his ability to work and this is
all without touching the guy just sittin

804
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:23,780
across montana room

805
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,569
so suggestions on your own

806
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:31,779
I'd love to hear I'm next couple minutes
left and make anything

807
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:36,400
raft of your head that

808
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,070
I've got up microphone here and also I'd
like to know

809
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:45,490
white you might be doing to help your
users know

810
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:49,470
deal with this terms education walk in
their devices down

811
00:50:49,470 --> 00:50:54,970
breakers well no Security Pro just tell
everybody I know and work with the take

812
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,520
anything that transmits of

813
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:00,440
but are you familiar with the pier see
if a 343

814
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,360
personal radio I know wickets apiece a
military equipment its

815
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,690
that's why you nurse what are radio

816
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:13,960
used by troops in the squad it runs on
the 2.4 gigahertz frequency

817
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:17,580
their two families one runs a $50
million watts

818
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:23,319
one runs a 100 know what's it also uses
Bluetooth for the Push to Talk sequence

819
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,740
um you can get

820
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,860
deactivate units on eBay and then re
some other make them work

821
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:34,470
I can be interesting that's all I have
to say

822
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:39,380
thank you for

823
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,250
if you on don't mind finding that how to
secure wifi sliding in real quick

824
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:49,190
on while you're finding the wifi slide
you mention Motorola headsets

825
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:54,240
%ah actually love motorola cellphones II
if you like the Motorola phone

826
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,570
I think it's great because as a frequent
flyer

827
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,110
I find that when we land Motorola
automatically enables discoverability

828
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,450
for the first 60 seconds when you turn
it on

829
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:06,150
soon as you turn on the phone is
discoverable so the first thing I do

830
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,250
when i turn my phone on

831
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:12,090
act I look for love you added

832
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:18,220
the this stopping wifi threats they got
on

833
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:23,140
I love tore I think on the developers
early today in his talk but

834
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:27,069
that doesn't stop you putting your
pretty face on all the emails to that

835
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:27,580
stuff's

836
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,350
incoming you can still you can still
attacked the laptop use kik

837
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,680
mandel the data yeah and down and better
nothin

838
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:39,070
its it is better than nothing he also
mentioned the firewall several times up

839
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:44,370
is really great misnomer about fire was
everybody thinks of a firearm safety

840
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:47,870
when you connect to the corporate
network you can still use violent print

841
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:48,400
sharing

842
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,200
your files are still accessible because
it's on the local area network

843
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:56,350
unless your firewall is configured to
block people on the local area network

844
00:52:56,350 --> 00:53:00,529
your you're out there and you have no
firewall so just

845
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,410
those if you think your local area
network is safe I

846
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,009
hope your wifi is turned off as well as
a few things

847
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:13,430
Korean funded here %uh huge thanks Ron T
Firefly Murray is seen in the artwork

848
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,080
from all

849
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,790
I'm artistic skills thank you very much
a

850
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:21,190
and also I am trying to finance this
trip so I have

851
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:24,550
sets in WPA cracking games with me in 33
excess

852
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,370
9 DVD's 50 bucks I am with me I'm

853
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:32,900
trainer is good if my head's I have them
with me all weekend

854
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,530
in the Jetta

855
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,900
station there i was just wondering

856
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:43,500
there've been in the real-world cases
are people up

857
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,590
attacking smart phones 3G EDGE network
that everything

858
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,060
on no another i'm aware. like through
bluetooth and I'm usually not through

859
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,330
like this 3G connection or anything like
that

860
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,710
I'll blackberries though is something to
find a way to take the network down on

861
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:58,430
command

862
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:01,690
you know the simpering piles view the
people become when they can get their

863
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:03,220
blackberry e-mails

864
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:06,870
now it'd be able to create that on
command I think would be a truly evil

865
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:07,680
thing

866
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,230
as when that

867
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,310
there the Google thing that was
mentioned earlier I believe it was

868
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:17,910
actually

869
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,930
the complete opposite up a secure system

870
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:25,220
it was actually Google's attempt at an
internet accelerator like NetZero does

871
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,290
wary cash is your internet connections
for you

872
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:32,279
but this led to a lot of web sites
people being logged into each other's

873
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,320
okay what I've seen looking around here

874
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,290
is a lot of people on their Gmail
accounts yes I jack

875
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:44,250
a lot of people who get their session
his crap but like I said this is by no

876
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:45,050
means a

877
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:50,300
complete an exhaustive list so Intl here
and if I get down to the mezzanine level

878
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,540
if they want to talk further

879
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:53,960
right to get out makers okay
