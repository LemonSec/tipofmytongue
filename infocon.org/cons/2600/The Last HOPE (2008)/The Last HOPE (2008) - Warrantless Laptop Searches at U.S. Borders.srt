1
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,619
so warm

2
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:14,860
thank you all for for cum

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,740
this talk I was worried that they're
only going to be champ evil in the room

4
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:18,240
because

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,250
and savages next door %uh but i really
appreciate your a

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,250
you being here um because I think this
is a really important topic

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,340
and the fact that you're here I helps
demonstrate and the fact that we're

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,480
that that I got to speak about this at
this conference helps demonstrate to you

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,239
our political system that there are
people that are concerned about that and

10
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,660
that is really important that's really
what I'm trying to do here

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,730
%uh so be over the basics

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,050
a US Customs

13
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,370
is randomly searching the contents
electronics devices at US border

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,050
checkpoints

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,560
I laptops PDAs cell phones digital
cameras

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,320
up you may be asked to review your
encryption key to them

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,430
I'm there are consequences if you do not

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,610
they could detain you they could sees
your device

19
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,619
I'm sometimes items have been seized

20
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,079
and return without explanation weeks or
months later a

21
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:14,950
the Association up corporate travel
executives which is kinda this lobbying

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,450
organization that tries to make

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,159
life easier for business travelers they
did a survey of their members they had a

24
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:23,409
hundred members respond to the survey

25
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:28,270
and seven %uh those respondents said
that they had had electronics seized

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:28,890
from them

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,450
by US customs at the border so these are
your business traveler's

28
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,640
a and I'm custom says

29
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,310
everyone is subject to risks CBP
inspection when they arrive in the US

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,440
about so I think

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:47,270
maybe twenty thirty years ago I we had
two things going on in this country we

32
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,369
have a drug or

33
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,619
I'm which are created what some people
refer to as the drug war exception to

34
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,720
the Constitution

35
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,250
a certain things are kinda overlooked

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,090
because %uh that system fault it was
useful for them to be able to

37
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:05,320
aggressively prevent narcotics
trafficking I'm at the same time

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,619
um the technology the people had access
to at that time

39
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:11,849
you know has has change dramatically I

40
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,328
today I people have these devices that
are increasingly powerful

41
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:20,170
have increasingly detailed records love
the correspondence

42
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,380
their thoughts arm and their their lives

43
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,160
and they carried them with them all the
time and that's really a new development

44
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,180
and so the policies that were developed
during the eighties

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,420
to deal with the drug war don't
necessarily make sense today with

46
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,470
today's technology in today's threats

47
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,480
are and so I'm there was a

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,179
you know get to this are a little bit
later but there was a Senate hearing

49
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,140
about this very subject a couple weeks
ago which is a positive development

50
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,040
on there was a guiding Peter Swire there
from the Center for American Progress

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,010
and he said this is an issue which may
be mobilised to preserve army of outrage

52
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:53,730
techies

53
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,720
well that sucks right so I that's why
I'm glad you all

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,010
are here and II it certainly

55
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,510
makes me angry I N and if it makes you
angry to you then then maybe we will

56
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,269
mobilize and and do something about it

57
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,620
um so well I'll get to that in a sec

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,290
so I before we get into the details I
was her personal story

59
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,510
I was once the subject about random a
border search by US Customs

60
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:22,510
I had been in Australia this is prior to
september 11th

61
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,018
I was on vacation and unfortunately I
had to cut my trip

62
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,500
up 'em early because I had a death in my
immediate family

63
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,790
and so I flew back to the United States
has flying into LAX

64
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,609
and me in my %uh sister were randomly
selected for search

65
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,680
at the border a and I'm no needless to
say I was kinda in a bad mood

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,099
a and you know I've got this these
people have decided to go through my

67
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,230
stuff and going through my bag right

68
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,769
and they hold up every single object in
the bag every

69
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:57,629
pair of underwear every t-shirt i holed
up in the season skiers

70
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:01,599
is this yours is this yours is this
year's

71
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,620
n it the the way that that questioning
work kinda freaked me out

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,720
because you get rolled into this sort
have automatic response

73
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,220
after the 20 or 30 s piece of clothing
is held up

74
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,418
you just gonna say yeah it's mine gets
mine

75
00:04:16,418 --> 00:04:19,478
yes mine without paying attention and so

76
00:04:19,478 --> 00:04:22,969
you know what they want to grab
something under the table on show to you

77
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,830
might say

78
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,949
match mine without really looking at it
first a

79
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,409
and that kinda bothered me wire--the why
the using this

80
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:34,259
assertive a a lot a system of
questioning that seems particularly

81
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:35,710
designed to elicit

82
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,020
and incorrect or false confession so I
was kinda pissed off

83
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,330
and I'm thinking I'm an American citizen
I'm on US soil this is the US government

84
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:48,909
that searching my stuff I was randomly
selected what's up with that

85
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:52,479
this should be a violation why Fourth
Amendment rights and I went and Google

86
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,248
that yet learned two things

87
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:58,039
the first thing is that Beanie Babies R
public enemy number one

88
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:02,180
I I what the first place I went was the
US Customs Service website

89
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,729
on this was a few weeks later after the
smoke cleared from everything I was

90
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:07,460
doing when I got back to the states

91
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,520
and the am the a

92
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,198
the they have a fact and the first item
in the fact on US Customs website at the

93
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:16,729
time

94
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,369
was why did you see is my beanie babies
at the time beanie babies were really

95
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,169
popular

96
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:24,919
and apparently there was no license
international distributor for them

97
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:28,080
then people would go over to taiwan or
whatever and the Red

98
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,659
be a bunch of look-alike beanie babies
available for sale on there would be

99
00:05:31,659 --> 00:05:32,879
cheap and they take a

100
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,619
greatly by a bunch of them and bring
back in and they get searched by customs

101
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:38,800
and the BBB's would be seized

102
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,149
us so you know and I want to be fair
about this

103
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:46,289
obviously the US Customs Service is
looking for terrorists

104
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:49,619
%uh but the vast majority uva

105
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:52,860
above those kinda stuff that ends up
getting targeted by these guys when they

106
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,860
do the searches

107
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,960
is israel unilaterally property law a
and I i'm gonna get

108
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,339
into that and in more detail later on ad
hoc a but I think it's important to

109
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,349
understand that

110
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,930
arm as far as I know other two

111
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,379
terrorist um a discoveries that are

112
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:14,029
they're worth noting the first one
occurred in the year two thousand

113
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,529
are at New Years there was a guy coming
in a

114
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:21,979
in Vancouver on some ferry from Canada
and had a bunch of explosives using

115
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:23,688
drive down blow-up LAX

116
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:28,149
and a they've they caught him I'm
there's the information about that is

117
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:28,889
sketchy but

118
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,219
ugg its its did does not appear that it
was a random search

119
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,029
they had reason to suspect the guy and
the guy acted suspiciously when I

120
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,449
started questioning him

121
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,939
and %uh eventually they because he was
being suspicious and I think you try to

122
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:41,719
run away

123
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:44,909
they decided to go through stuff and
then they found explosives

124
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:49,889
um the some the second case I is a case
that happened inner

125
00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,559
I'm see home um a said Minneapolis for
Minnesota

126
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:57,999
I'm the he if they had a guy

127
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:00,789
that they found for the system called
eighty ass which is a profiling system

128
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:01,589
so instead

129
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:05,499
again he was randomly selected for
search he was chosen by this profiling

130
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,429
system and there's debate about that
profiling system too but

131
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:11,949
in any event um they went through his
laptop and found a couple martyrdom

132
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:16,229
videos apparently and information about
how to create ID's and so

133
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,300
the use that as an example by this
profiling system works they might have a

134
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:19,849
point

135
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:23,779
the profiling system might work I how
neither of these people were

136
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:27,889
were found through random searches and
the question is

137
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,479
you know how likely is it that they're
gonna find a terrorist through a totally

138
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:32,789
random search purses

139
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,080
what impact are these random searches
going to have on people's freedom

140
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,469
so I'm the other thing I learned to are
I guess and I will I believe when I have

141
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:42,580
been search that it was a violation my
fourth member

142
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,859
right so I dug into this and I I learned
that the fourth member doesn't work the

143
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,240
way that I thought that at that

144
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,569
%uh this is the fourth amendment and it
says the right of the people to be

145
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:53,479
secure in their persons houses papers
and effects against unreasonable

146
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,339
searches and seizures shall not be

147
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:58,879
violated and no warrants shall issue but
upon probable cause

148
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,050
whitewater ball I hmmm so

149
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,989
the way to read this apparently is to
think about it as two clauses

150
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:09,219
the first clause says the right of the
people to be secure against unreasonable

151
00:08:09,219 --> 00:08:11,029
searches should not be violated

152
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,020
the second clause says no warrants shall
issue but upon probable cause

153
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,270
but it doesn't say that you have to have
a warrant in order to poor form a search

154
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,969
for the dust work is required

155
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:24,110
in order to make a search reasonable.
apparently me

156
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,689
two hundred years ago we really didn't
have police the way we do today and the

157
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,050
founders didn't really consider the idea
that you might have police you might

158
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,159
need to do things

159
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,770
with out a specific warrant um
authorizing what they're doing

160
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,789
and so I'm they just sorta crafted it
this way and it at and over time we've

161
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:44,480
we have these these police officers the
that we've

162
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,420
these police forces we've developed and
we've given them from official 14 they

163
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,189
do all these things that require them to
perform surgeons

164
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,680
and and the result is that there are all
these cases where the courts have

165
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,009
decided to work isn't required

166
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,600
so I am one of those cases the border
search case in a media back to these two

167
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,889
case precedents later on in the talk

168
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,440
um but there's United States persons
ramsey in 1977

169
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,310
searches made at the border reason we're
simply by virtue of the fact that they

170
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,290
occur at the border

171
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,980
on because the reasonable work doesn't
require no unreasonable searches and

172
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,100
seizures

173
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,639
are and then there's this other case
from 85 routine searches

174
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:22,879
a person's effective entrance are not
subject to any requirement reasonable

175
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,379
suspicion probable cause or what

176
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,079
up I'm going the wrong way and you that
way

177
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,990
I'm so in addition business later on
they develop this

178
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,680
in the eighties the developed this up
this distinction between routine and

179
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,060
non-routine searches

180
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,069
routine searches can beef performed
random non-routine searches require

181
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,469
reasonable suspicion

182
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,110
the question is what is a routine search
and what is a non-routine search

183
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,329
and what is reasonable suspicion and
those are things that are still

184
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,709
sorted being defined I so do

185
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:57,410
when we ya got started with this an 85
the Supreme Court held that reasonable

186
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,290
suspicion is required to search

187
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,689
travelers elementary now I'm

188
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,750
this individual was smuggling cocaine in
condoms that they had swallowed

189
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,240
and they were held by customs for a few
days and hopes that they would expunge

190
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,110
them

191
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,329
I from their body I'm and the Supreme
Court found that

192
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:19,500
they couldn't do that at random they had
to have some reason to suspect that you

193
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,449
had swallowed cocaine balloons before

194
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:25,370
handcuffing you to a share for three
days us so

195
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,199
I'm dots a you know it's not reasonable
suspicion is not the strongest standard

196
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:30,949
in the world

197
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:34,810
it's not the same as probable cause are
here's an example from a court case the

198
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,279
suspect arrived from

199
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:39,959
Columbia they were traveling alone they
had only one suitcase they nothing to

200
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,810
declare

201
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,620
was a young clean looking attractive
woman wearing a shoe loose-fitting dress

202
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,439
from

203
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:49,410
reasonable suspicion she did in fact
have cocaine taped to her admin

204
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:52,430
at demand so arm

205
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,620
so you know that's not a very sort
stronger

206
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,629
basis for suspicion I'm and of course
this is the way whites get a row did

207
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,649
you these people going to court over and
over and over again with different

208
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,160
judges with the guilty party in AC we
had reasonable suspicion because I've

209
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,019
XYZ ridiculous criteria

210
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:13,180
and the judge either has to say wall
okay you had reasonable suspicion or

211
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,800
they have to let the guilty party go

212
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,430
and so generally speaking I'm they say
okay fine we're gonna cap that is

213
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,699
reasonable suspicion

214
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:23,730
and over time these things begin to
become contradictory I suspect was first

215
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:24,519
so the plane

216
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,639
class to the plane the plane from Middle
had one way tickets round trip tickets

217
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,050
a nonstop flight changed planes from
traveling alone

218
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,600
traveling with a companion acted
nervously acted Newcombe

219
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,920
we've I am years 01 other thing I say
but reasonable suspicion

220
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,160
suspect arrived from Germany am
traveling alone had only one backpack

221
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,709
and no items requiring customs
inspection

222
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:50,439
was carrying a laptop iPod Cell Phone
laser pointer radius Karen of electronic

223
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:53,569
parts and components and was wearing a
t-shirt that said 2600 the hacker

224
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:55,099
quarterly

225
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,550
reasonable suspicion Ceram

226
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,519
this is not a very strong standard so
there's two questions well one of them

227
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,319
is

228
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:08,079
do does a does a laptop art is a
forensic investigation laptop

229
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,550
um is a routine search doesn't require
reasonable suspicion

230
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,740
and I'm this is really the open question
today

231
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,230
are the most recent president is from
2004

232
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,649
I the United States Supreme Court heard
the customs agents me would move the gas

233
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:24,350
tank from a vehicle crossing
international border in an effort to

234
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,470
look for contraband

235
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,540
and they may do that with at random I'll

236
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,550
so arm you know is a laptop

237
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,699
more like we know we know reasonable
suspicion is required to serve summons

238
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,100
elementary canal

239
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,670
we know it's not required to take the
gas tank of the car and take apart

240
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:42,579
what is a laptop search more like I
don't know it I guess it depends on

241
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:43,889
what's on your laptop

242
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,589
%uh the reasonable suspicion is such a
weak standard

243
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,819
you know who cares who cares if they
require reasonable suspicion white

244
00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:52,449
there's two reasons to care

245
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:56,420
the first is that the Canton happen at
random if they require it

246
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,569
which means it will happen less
frequently and won't be quotas

247
00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:02,660
I think that the randomly searched the
bags have about

248
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,810
are one to two percent of everyone that
comes into the United States

249
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,310
%uh so if you think that there's like
three other people on a 747

250
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,389
then that's like three to six people of
every plane

251
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,610
um so thats actually pretty frequent I'm

252
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,790
if if it if it requires reasonable
suspicion that you won't have that

253
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,629
nearly that many people being searched

254
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,379
a and I'm the other thing is that if
they can't do it

255
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,670
at random the making dua to everyone and
so so you

256
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:32,329
you've got the solid state storage
devices coming out I'm

257
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:35,389
you know say you know you have some
breakthrough in technology

258
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,509
and it becomes really efficient to
duplicate a hard drive you can do it in

259
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:39,509
a few seconds

260
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:44,029
let's say that happens I if you bring
arm all address questions after the

261
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:47,550
after the talk but if you you know if if
we get there

262
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,600
then you can have a situation where
people are bringing laptops in

263
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
and all the contents are being copied
I'll

264
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,819
and so warm that would be a quite scary
I think

265
00:13:58,819 --> 00:14:02,089
a so before I get into our

266
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:05,649
there's the recent court case on this
issue I wanted take a step back and just

267
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,189
look at this legal framework because

268
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:11,279
I'm not sure that what was decided in
the late seventies and early eighties

269
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,509
made any sense

270
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,790
if you go back to this case that I
mentioned in 1985 it says

271
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,980
routine searches are the person said if
accident rates are not subject to

272
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,040
any requirement reasonable suspicion
that's what they say

273
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,680
that's the time when they're really
officially said it was 85

274
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,720
rRNA reference this footnote in not in
the

275
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,949
in the Supreme Court decision footnote
says see United States v ramzi

276
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:39,290
and a buncha dicta thats my warning I'm
details when the supreme court has this

277
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,319
issue that they're assessing and

278
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,420
they decide to say something about
something else

279
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,769
and it doesn't relate to the issue
they're deciding it's not really

280
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm necessary hope for their holding but
it's an indicator for future with a

281
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,059
conserved how they might

282
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:57,589
how they might I'm make a decision and
there's all this dick to around border

283
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,670
searches where

284
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,529
US Supreme Court was talking about
someone getting search and they make

285
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:04,240
this comment like more of this was at
the border it would be different because

286
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,059
it wasn't

287
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:09,319
this is how we're gonna do things here
um and these these comments were sorta

288
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:12,939
brought up that that made various times
in history Supreme Court said things

289
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:14,240
would be different at the border

290
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,319
as a justification for the idea that
there are no rules at the border

291
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:20,689
Armando much for that makes so much
sense I but it makes the most sense to

292
00:15:20,689 --> 00:15:21,730
focus on

293
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,459
the actual place where they were looking
at a broader search and made a binding

294
00:15:24,459 --> 00:15:26,079
decision about a border search

295
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,309
and that was USB ramzi and USB ramzi
they said the congress

296
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:34,149
they're trying to justify the idea that
they don't need a warrant at the border

297
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:37,519
and they say the congress which proposed
the bill of rights including the fourth

298
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,230
amendment

299
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,740
to state legislatures in 1789 had

300
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,619
some two months prior to that and acted
the first custom statute

301
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:51,059
in out alive 79 and this statute custom
great in customs officials Paul

302
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:54,439
full power and authority to enter and
search any ship or vessel

303
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:57,990
in which they shall have reason to
suspect any goods wares or merchandise

304
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,369
subject to duty shall be concealed

305
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:03,980
so Inc in in 1789

306
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,279
they passed this law that said that the
customers can search things that they

307
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,769
have a reason to suspect

308
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,850
might contain contraband and the Supreme
Court is using that law

309
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,110
as a justification for a policy in
nineteen

310
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,730
85 that says that no reasonable
suspicion is required

311
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,749
in that to me is fundamentally a logical
I'm

312
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,449
if they're is a historic basis for the
assertion

313
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:32,170
that that the founding fathers did not
believe the customs officials needed

314
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,629
reasonable suspicion that fourth
amendment required reasonable suspicion

315
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,439
to border

316
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:40,319
it certainly wasn't established in this
case I'm and and there's more research

317
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:43,100
that needs to be done but unfortunately
this is what has happened

318
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,220
you have this court that makes this
claim and a couple of other courts

319
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,360
reference this in

320
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,600
they make little modifications to it and
now we have this policy that says they

321
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,589
can be random searches and that really
came outta nowhere as far as I can tell

322
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:58,129
on someone with the more about
background in the history of the

323
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:01,800
the founding of this republic might have
some interesting references that relate

324
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,240
to it but no one has done any

325
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,380
that research as far as I know I'm so
here's a Supreme Court case that

326
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,220
well no it's not sorry this is a court
case that's going on right now

327
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,430
are it was recently decided i buy the
night circuit appellate court it is

328
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,899
still sorta been process and I'll talk
about its status %uh but it gives you

329
00:17:19,899 --> 00:17:21,770
good example of how these things happen

330
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,299
I'll US persons on old on July 17 2005
this guy came in LA axe

331
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:31,299
I'm from the Philippines he was selected
for secondary screening

332
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:35,230
a he was vacationing for with friends in
the Philippines

333
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,450
um they asked him to look at his
computer he booted it up

334
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,940
%uh there were so Kodak pictures in
Cuttack memories directories on his hard

335
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,510
drive

336
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,879
they started clicking on the customs
agents started clicking on this folders

337
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,059
and opening the pictures

338
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,860
and one of them had a picture that
depicted to nude women

339
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,860
now a pic no one has ever established as
far as I know import that those

340
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,080
are women were not adult women are in it
and what are the

341
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,029
I guess that's how important has a
footnote in there in their decision

342
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:02,779
where they say

343
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:05,809
customs did not establish that the is
that this was child pornography as far

344
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:06,360
as

345
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,429
um as far as anyone knows those were
picture for adult women

346
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,640
up in any event the the investigator
called

347
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,820
a %uh the Department of Homeland
Security and Customs Enforcement and all

348
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,799
these people came in the question this
guy for several hours and they started

349
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,350
going through sup up in more detail in
virtually they did find child

350
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,360
pornography

351
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,580
a so this since the this raises the
question Nov

352
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,970
you know how many hours love
interrogation what you got if you happen

353
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,539
to have a

354
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:34,570
the porter a legal pornographic picture
on your hard drive

355
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,168
um in this case he also had illegal
pornographic pictures on his hard drive

356
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,240
on so he got charged I and he was
convicted

357
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,840
and then know that the district court
%uh however decided that term

358
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,699
a so there's this force month had okay
switches from 2004

359
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,880
um and and it it to it it decided that
term

360
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,340
%ah you know it was legal for customs to
take the gas tank of a car and take it

361
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,158
apart

362
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,100
I look at its contents without any
suspicion they could do that random

363
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:08,110
on and there's two different courts here
who have serve decided this

364
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,649
Arnold case on the basis of that that
gas tank decision

365
00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:16,230
won the Miss the district court with and
they decided that that the gas tank case

366
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,919
implied that there are certain context
in which you have real privacy interests

367
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,500
that might require I'm a heightened
suspicion from custom service before

368
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,440
they can violate the privacy interests
and so they decided that reasonable

369
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,830
suspicion was required to search the
laptop

370
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,020
the night circuit arm meet another

371
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,168
or that they they have a different view
really the opposite view based on the

372
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,220
same case

373
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,080
I'll they I guess prior to 2004 had been
employing

374
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,720
this intrusiveness analysis to determine
whether or not

375
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,140
you know a search was justified at the
border and

376
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,120
they felt that this gas tank cases
served throughout their intrusive this

377
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,230
analysis approach in that they had to
allow any search for property

378
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,600
and so they said reasonable suspicion is
not needed all these laptops searches

379
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,240
are legal

380
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,370
with no reasonable suspicion at all I'll

381
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,669
so I I don't agree with this night
circuit holding and I'm gonna pick it

382
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:06,690
apart a little bit

383
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,929
I'm they say I'll the they talk about it
as if its property and the people who

384
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:15,390
support this policy who want these
random searches happening

385
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,179
they use all fours montano into contact
with the talk about

386
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:23,470
property in general and that case if you
read it very specifically limit itself

387
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:26,409
to the context vehicles and searches
vehicles

388
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:29,730
I'm on wiki pedia it says %uh

389
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,620
complex balancing test to determine the
paraphrases the the Supreme Court cases

390
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,539
complex balancing test to determine what
is routine

391
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,789
and what is intrusive have no place in
border searches irv

392
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:42,870
property in a property in brackets in
Wikipedia

393
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,250
the actual word in the Supreme Court
doren in the supreme court decision is

394
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,500
vehicles and not property

395
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,490
and so it's possible that this and this
this rule only applies in the context

396
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,940
the vehicles and doesn't apply for
laptops at all

397
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,039
but the sort of the circle logical
sleight of hand is

398
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,140
used in order to expand the scope at
this decision

399
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,370
%uh the the night circuit the

400
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,529
the the force montana okay said that
there were context in which a search was

401
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:12,840
particularly offensive and therefore
would require reasonable suspicion

402
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,678
a search of an alimentary canal for
example %uh the night circuit

403
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,019
decided that um that that the

404
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:23,570
particularly offensive or did not apply
in the context of a laptop search

405
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,049
in the the reasoning the use was sloppy
the

406
00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:30,879
the they compare it to this case
involving a mobile home

407
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,630
and there's decision that that they
could search a mobile home without

408
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,700
getting a warrant

409
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,669
because mobile homes are mobile and so
if there you go to the park if they want

410
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:40,970
to search this mobile home

411
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:44,830
and they call into our to get a warrant
someone to drive the mobile home to a

412
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,889
different jurisdiction

413
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,149
and then there were or apply know what
people search in anymore %uh so the

414
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:51,990
the court decided that they were able to
search mobile homes without getting a

415
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,899
warrant but they still had to establish
probable cause in order to do it and if

416
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,950
it turned out that they hadn't really
establish that

417
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,429
then retrospect the evidence would be
for an out-of-court

418
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,580
I and but um you know in that case the
person was saying we need to work

419
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,070
because

420
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:09,879
its mobile but it is my home I am so the
plights now since laptop

421
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,059
who said it's the same situation it's a

422
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,418
because you can carry it with you I'm no
warm no suspicion is required to search

423
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,720
in that analysis that

424
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,190
analogy doesn't make any sense I the
first is the fifth

425
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,409
excuse me my thoughts trying out a
little bit something was going water

426
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:27,590
that would be awesome

427
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:31,959
um but anyway the the first issue is
that

428
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,370
um a vehicle

429
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,779
a even though the vehicle are was
readily mobile and therefore they

430
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,649
couldn't they didn't have to go through
the process of getting this warning

431
00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:45,190
which takes time are they still had to
establish thank you very much the study

432
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,590
established probable cause an order
search the vehicle standard suspicion

433
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:49,539
didn't change

434
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,539
because the because the mobile homes
mobile it was just the process that they

435
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,929
had to go through in order to establish
that standard

436
00:22:55,929 --> 00:22:59,620
that changed in this case there's no
time to lay involved in assessing

437
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:03,130
whether or not reasonable suspicion
exists versus having a random search

438
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,720
I'll so the whole concept that that time
delay could cause you to have the object

439
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,070
move to a different jurisdictions

440
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,649
doesn't apply here it so it makes
absolutely no sense

441
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:15,990
duh to to use this this precedent in
this context

442
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,820
it's almost it's really confusing to
read it almost confusing to explain

443
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,220
because

444
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,480
because it it makes little rational
sense it's for sloppy

445
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,659
I I personally have this this opinion
that

446
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:31,519
the 9th circuit they got this case the
saw this guy he's a pedofile he was

447
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,570
traveling overseas he might've been

448
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:37,889
doing it for in order to molest children
he's really a bad guy

449
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,140
a they got this case arm you know
there's evidence against him

450
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,460
and then they have this this this
constitutional appeal where they say

451
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,630
well they shouldn't be able to search
his laptop and they're like

452
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,080
whatever you know I I just don't think
they took it very seriously and that

453
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,439
kinda threw together the sloppy decision
that says

454
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,889
you know case closed he's going to jail
and and

455
00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:02,539
I i don't know if they took it very
seriously I have heard this rumor

456
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,070
I'll that that and I i SR confirm that I
i really am not aware so I don't know

457
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,189
exactly how this works but I for that
they've

458
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,059
decided to do an on blank a a review of
this decision

459
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:16,460
and so the night circuit might be
issuing different decision in this case

460
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,360
I don't know why they're able to do that
but there was after this decision was

461
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,990
handed down a few months later there was
a Senate hearing

462
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:26,210
and so they might have said you whew
wait a minute maybe someone does care

463
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,460
about this decision and hey which was
that we did a real sloppy job with it so

464
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:31,590
maybe we'll go back and take another
look

465
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,918
up arm so mmm

466
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,429
my problem I hope all get to that minute
actually

467
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:41,309
I'm there's this other policy
development in addition to that case as

468
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:44,740
far as I know that case was decided by
the night circuit tonight circuit said

469
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,250
laptop searches are legal

470
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,970
and everyone who wants reading laptop
searches is you know celebrating that

471
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:50,980
decision

472
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,779
some people have come forward in the
Senate hearing in spite of how sloppy it

473
00:24:53,779 --> 00:24:54,429
wasn't said

474
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:57,860
we think this was a very good decision
%ah um

475
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,159
the other shoe is this
anti-counterfeiting trade agreement

476
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,100
which was leaked to the press on May
22nd

477
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,350
it's this treaty and we all know that
that one other things the intellectual

478
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:11,000
property interest will do is is getting
international treaty signed that defends

479
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,899
their interests

480
00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:15,740
I'm because once a treaty is signed all
these countries are are are beholden to

481
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,440
a two to enforce it

482
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,460
and arm it gets approved without going
through the normal democratic processes

483
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,659
in each others countries

484
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:26,080
%uh so you know Congress doesn't
necessarily have the same kind a debate

485
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,899
about enforcing a treaty that they would
if these people

486
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:33,139
should have proposed the same rules as a
local like I'm United States law

487
00:25:33,139 --> 00:25:36,980
so one they're trying to do that with
this any cut any counterfeiting trade

488
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,830
agreement and

489
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,918
no one's really sure exactly what this
thing says are

490
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,149
I'm there were just some details about
it that were leaked but

491
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:48,049
not the full taxed I and were there's
this

492
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:51,210
get a data card Asus newspaper they part
they said

493
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,380
this deal would create an international
regulator that would turn border guards

494
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,940
and other public security personnel

495
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,620
into copyright police security officials
will be charged with checking laptops

496
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,179
iPods and even so your phones for
content that infringes on copyright laws

497
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,960
such as rip CDs or movies

498
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,090
at so you know I think that if they
looked at your iPod that there's no way

499
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:08,889
they could tell

500
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:12,610
that those mp3's were legal or not but
if they get in if you they got your

501
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,490
laptop today when you're running bare
share something like that

502
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,549
you haven't outgoing director an
incoming director in this but your files

503
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:19,668
and directories

504
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:22,769
you know I think that that's probably
reasonable doubt that you had shared

505
00:26:22,769 --> 00:26:23,610
those things

506
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:27,710
so I'm you know there really are they
may be really be talking about having

507
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,850
custom searches

508
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:34,600
customs official start searching laptops
for mp3's

509
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,960
half so what has happened will there or
not the case gets

510
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,419
appeal to the Supreme Court I mean it
will be appealed to the Supreme Court he

511
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,059
get I hope so

512
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:47,330
but it's possible that they won't arm
everyone will

513
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,299
apparently there's been a there's been a
few decisions that have related to

514
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:51,908
laptop searches and

515
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm for various technical reasons no
court

516
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,799
a throughout a laptop search I'm this
decision was

517
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,149
specifically about whether that laptop
search could be done without reasonable

518
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:03,120
suspicion

519
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,919
and the court did not throw the old the
the at night circuit

520
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,080
you know I upheld the search and so a
lot of people were thinking what the

521
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,830
supreme court's not going to take this

522
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:15,580
because on there seems to be a consensus
across districts again that's a

523
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,678
that's a few advocated by the people
that like these laptops searchers

524
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,769
and it's possible that because there is
a Senate hearing about this that may be

525
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,029
the supreme court will take it

526
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,169
we'll see on they get to decide are

527
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,600
The Washington Post has reported that
law firms are asking employees to travel

528
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,200
to keep two laptops

529
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,070
a travel laptop that doesn't have any
data on it hand and when there when

530
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,379
they're

531
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,330
traveling overseas the only put the
information on that laptop that they

532
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,678
need for that meeting

533
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,740
um some other corporations are doing
similar things

534
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,380
Jennifer Granik posted advice for
travelers and you talk about that a

535
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,509
little bit more detail

536
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:54,330
are the EFSF wrote an open letter to
Congress shortly after the night circuit

537
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,480
health handed down the moral decision
and they said hold a hearing

538
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,250
and and what's awesome is that they did
the Senate held a hearing on June 20th

539
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:05,350
%uh so that's that's great news I'm and

540
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,710
the FF is also out joint filed a Freedom
of Information Act two to learn more

541
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,690
about border search practices

542
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,659
well there's some there's a a group I'll

543
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,529
there's a group that represents
muslim-americans that testified at the

544
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:20,029
Senate Judiciary Committee

545
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:23,639
and they had a lot of fun ver
interesting testimony about

546
00:28:23,639 --> 00:28:27,240
the kinds of things that their members
happens subjected to

547
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,419
there's an example if the guy that wrote
an editorial for the

548
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,539
up a the Toledo Blade a

549
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:36,769
that was critical of US government
policy and he showed up at a border

550
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:37,440
checkpoint

551
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,929
and he was searched in the border guards
like to picked up this

552
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:44,789
editorial started asking him questions
about his political views

553
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:48,639
um so things like that are are pretty a
pre questionable and so on

554
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:51,509
on Thursday there some additional
context around that's where they they

555
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,590
think that certain people are being
unnecessarily

556
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,750
and unfairly single out um so

557
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:01,600
before we go on with the the policy
discussion you know what can you do to

558
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,610
protect yourself from getting

559
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,940
your personal stuff searched at the
border I one thing that people wonder is

560
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,990
we're all just encrypt my files right

561
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:14,720
well they couldn't as I said earlier on
they can ask you for your incursion keys

562
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,500
are there was a federal court that ruled
recently

563
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,970
it's not the Supreme Court but they've
they ruled that you have a fifth member

564
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,669
right to refuse to reveal your password
its you know you have a right not to

565
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:26,840
incriminate yourself

566
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:31,070
but there are people who don't agree
with that ruling or in care she's a law

567
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:33,950
professor at GW he's very smart guy

568
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:38,600
but up you know he often I think
sometimes he he sides with the

569
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,789
the authorities used to be a a the
public justice prosecutor

570
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:46,200
but he said the the password itself is
not incriminating only the information

571
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,309
to protect

572
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:50,918
and so the fifth amendment can protect
the password and

573
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,070
that's his I don't agree with that
reasoning but he he's a serious guy has

574
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,389
seriously be that argument

575
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:59,630
and that argument might 0 end up being
upheld by the courts

576
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,889
um so for now its its it's an
interesting

577
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:07,029
subjective if it comes up again the
course will consider a further

578
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:10,419
a the agents could detain you for days
I'm

579
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:13,240
they could seize your laptop and send
you on your way they seem to do that

580
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,210
rather frequently

581
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,250
even if they even if we don't have an
issue where you refusing to turn over a

582
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,149
password

583
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,529
um they can also deny you entry in the
US they could tell you go back

584
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:27,519
um its I don't know and and no one has
delved into this into much detail

585
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,210
if you are a US citizen its apparently
difficult for them to absolutely deny

586
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,740
you entry into the country

587
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:38,429
I'm sure that the customs agents could
tell you to get to go back in

588
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:42,250
yeah so

589
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,889
to eight with that could be an
interesting a occur for full if it

590
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:47,000
actually occurred

591
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,620
um so there's this thing called
TrueCrypt that that term

592
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:55,000
people are using II with this is my
personal view and TrueCrypt

593
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,750
and number one customs forensics agents
are computer savvy the certainties

594
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,230
aren't

595
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:02,350
she points to bed I trigger can be
detected

596
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,070
even in travel mode by inspecting the
registry if I was a customs

597
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,529
agent and I was expecting people to do
this I would look for that registry key

598
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:14,539
a the the trooper bootloader can be
detected just released this new version

599
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,509
through capital I should have a complete
operating system that hidden in your

600
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,419
bootloader select Set but of course the

601
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,779
the bootloader is a in going the master
boot record on your

602
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:26,299
on your hard drive and they could check
for it with the with a friend 6 wall so

603
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:27,870
they can detect that you're using this

604
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:30,850
and so what do you what happens when
they detected well you can't deny that

605
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:33,000
there's a hidden no answer hidden file
system

606
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,970
and they can detain you a and that they
could detain you for several days hoping

607
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:37,970
that your fess up

608
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,830
%uh so that's on that's not fun and I
don't recommend I def we don't recommend

609
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,149
lying to customs

610
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:46,899
you don't wanna become the murder for a
order searchers

611
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:50,779
um the other thing a the other thing I
mean there may be other steganography

612
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:54,210
that's more effective depending upon
what they're looking for in with her

613
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,789
what their techniques and tactics are
and I don't know what their their

614
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,000
techniques and tactics are necessarily

615
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,070
arm are I kept out this guy's last name

616
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,470
a is so horny in so kahan

617
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,700
aka Christopher so kahan this is a very
sort of practical approach from a

618
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,870
logical standpoint

619
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:15,039
he said that I wipe your laptop you know
encrypt your data and put a file server

620
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,519
and then go we're going

621
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:19,679
download this encrypt the data block
over the Internet

622
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,409
the crib that use it and then reprinted
in rio uploaded and what your laptop

623
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,289
again for your back on a plane

624
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:30,049
this works I'll and and this I what I
like about this is it really points out

625
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,110
the absurdity of this whole policy

626
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,409
because you can use a process like this
to completely avoid having any

627
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:37,820
information with you when you physically
cross the border

628
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,500
but this is not a this is not a very a
practical

629
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,950
way to approach this problem for most
people it's very very slow

630
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,320
%uh in it in its a um it you know it's

631
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,330
it's very difficult to to to live this
way a

632
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,570
but I think we should do instead is
advocated policies change

633
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,899
I that's really why I'm here I we should
not be afraid to fly overseas with our

634
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:01,070
laptops

635
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,600
I and and I also think that it's
important to get the policy right we

636
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,710
constantly in the scene

637
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:09,090
get into these situations where we think
the government is doing something wrong

638
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,710
it's what we do is we develop these
technologies that allow you to get away

639
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,669
with it anyway

640
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:17,059
and the problem is that that the bad
people there are bad people out there

641
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:19,559
are bad people who end up using these
technologies to

642
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,830
are and the fact that there's a lot of
innocent people using them great all

643
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,769
discover traffic for the bad stuff

644
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,820
right a so if we actually had good
policy

645
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,639
that said that you know we were not this
is America were not randomly searching

646
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:32,320
people

647
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,649
%uh innocent people wouldn't feel like
they would need to use TrueCrypt a

648
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:40,139
and I'm you know it the fact is that
term we wouldn't end up providing tools

649
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,000
to people who are actually up to no good

650
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,019
so I'm you know i i think that their
there really is a good argument for

651
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:51,029
for getting the policy right um and and
I have several arguments on a present

652
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,580
them

653
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,190
I because those view her interest in the
subject to go out into the internet and

654
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,289
at least one of you is going to end up
in an argument with someone about this

655
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:03,200
so should know with the would sure some
hear some ammunition for that

656
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,860
a pending argument the first is that I
love the there these guys say will

657
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,659
Customs has this historical

658
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,899
ability to search any piece of luggage
coming into the united states and

659
00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,089
a laptop is no different from a
businessman's briefcase it's the same

660
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:15,700
thing

661
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,350
and we should use the same policies that
we always have I will I disagree with

662
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,629
that computers are not just like luggage

663
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,420
by default luggage contains nothing and
you only packed the things you want to

664
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,620
bring in your trip

665
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,130
computers containing everything the
canteen all your correspondence

666
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:34,180
all your personal information and and
the only way that you can Collins them

667
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,659
for trip is to remove things that you
don't want the customs to see

668
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:41,310
%uh that's a totally different process
and it's actually very difficult to do

669
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm technology has changed the scope of
personal information that people carry

670
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,500
with them these devices is

671
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,679
X massively expanded over the past ten
years

672
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,589
hand and as I said earlier these drug
war era rationalizations that we need to

673
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,630
search the stuff in order to find
cocaine

674
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,800
you know just don't make sense in this
high-tech context it's completely

675
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,220
different

676
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,520
um John Perry Barlow once famously said
in this is Ben

677
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,170
paraphrased by a lot of people you can
have my encryption algorithm when you

678
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,200
pry my cold dead fingers from its
private key

679
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,620
people do not want to show up at the
border and have some customs agent ask

680
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,370
them for their Krypton key

681
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,540
day you know and and frankly I can
understand the

682
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,400
in the indignation of people who would
save you know fuck you I'm not telling

683
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,870
you what my password as

684
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:28,299
I'll that's why it that's my privacy or
violating and you know unfortunately

685
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,430
people who

686
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,330
who do stand up to these customs agents
and say no I'm not giving you my key

687
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,759
you know they might end up getting
detained they might end up having their

688
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,660
equipment seized with the same time a
kind understand a perspective I think

689
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,529
it's

690
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,720
you know to a certain extent it's a
brave thing to do I'll

691
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,070
you know it and um Peter Swire from CAP
when he was testifying at the senate

692
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:50,520
amid he drew an analogy between this
debate in the clipper chip debate from

693
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,950
the early nineteen nineties

694
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,109
he said this is very similar we're
asking for access to people's private

695
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,350
information we're asking

696
00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:00,040
for access to their crib today to and
you know people might

697
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,900
necessarily resist that pretty strongly
I'll

698
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,350
you know I don't believe that the fourth
amendment with the Fourth Amendment says

699
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,200
I think that when the fourth member says
unreasonable searches that means no

700
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,640
searches without a reason

701
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,770
means no random searches that's what I
think a I certainly don't think

702
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:19,100
that there's some integrated the
sovereign to rain we search people stuff

703
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,660
that applies the United States

704
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,170
I'm if it does exist it certainly has
been proven by the case presents that

705
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,230
that that we have I think a very sketchy
I showed you in this presentation why I

706
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,240
think they're sketchy

707
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,060
I and and they're from the late
seventies and early eighties are not

708
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,620
from

709
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,620
you know the 1780s I in the law on the
17 eighties

710
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:40,259
required reasonable suspicion and I
think are require reasonable suspicion

711
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,240
that

712
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,170
I and further more random searches are
inefficient this is something even

713
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:44,800
though

714
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,800
the the conservatives on the site on the
in this debate will concede that that

715
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,740
you know this is not the right way to
find terrorist this is not the right way

716
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,380
to find

717
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,500
drug traffickers you should find you
have a reason to suspect people you

718
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,190
should focus limited resources

719
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,200
on the people that you have a reason to
suspect a

720
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,010
this is this is this what I what I
consider that most gapping form

721
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,320
in the reasoning behind this entire
thing people don't smuggling formation

722
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,530
in laptops the smoke alarm over the
Internet

723
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,350
I'll we all know this if customs were
real was really working on some sort of

724
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,319
copper hits a plan to prevent the
smuggling of illegal information

725
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,050
they would be surveilling international
telecommunications links and not

726
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,760
searching people laptops the border

727
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,600
this whole thing is just a loophole in
the law that was created the final

728
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,110
product

729
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,460
to applying laptops is not a
comprehensive policy

730
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,830
with their going out there and trying to
prevent information smuggling it bears

731
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,930
no resemblance to such a policy

732
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,779
are this same in with information that
they claim the right to investigate

733
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,480
when it on your laptop at the border
would be protected by a work requirement

734
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,870
if it was being sent over the Internet
the the Faiza

735
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,930
in particularly the recent update defies
a even made this

736
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:55,370
me this this what reform more onerous
for the police that was before with the

737
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,540
car in the context of American citizens

738
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,860
a so so it makes absolutely no sense
that that if I send it over the Internet

739
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,570
they have to get a warrant but if I
bring it on

740
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,900
on floppy disk they can take a look at
it that's ridiculous a

741
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,060
and so I I advise you to do I two things
the first is

742
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:15,490
potentially contactor congresspersons a
and and you know be respectful when you

743
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,760
do this don't be an asshole

744
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,870
no one likes assholes I'll you know 3

745
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,970
if you're talking to remember the
central district many a

746
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,310
thank them for holding a hearing it's
very important they did and in

747
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,090
do you know on both sides of the aisle
other perspectives offered at that

748
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,410
hearing were very balance

749
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,879
%uh there's concern all around about the
privacy issues here

750
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,150
senators have blackberries and they have
laptops and they get searched when they

751
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,190
go places like

752
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,260
china for example and they're concerned
about that and if we do the same thing

753
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,530
in the United States would have a hard
time arguing the tradition do it

754
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,260
and so I'm this is something that is
really a concern for them and and and

755
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:53,580
that's one of the ways we might win this
argument that that those people share

756
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,040
our same worries

757
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,930
I'll you know tell them that custom
should not be allowed to perform

758
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,720
searches of laptops without reasonable
suspicion

759
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,510
it's very simple unreasonable suspicions
on a very high standard

760
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:08,730
it's not going to stop them from busting
bad people a and and I would also ask

761
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,560
you to tell them

762
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,250
that customs must perform privacy impact
assessment we don't know

763
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:17,090
how many searches are really going on we
don't know how many people been targeted

764
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,830
we don't know how much equipment seized

765
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:22,310
we don't know if the date on that cures
been copied or how long it's been stored

766
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,259
who's being

767
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,440
whose has access to it but it's being
used for are these are very interesting

768
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,100
questions

769
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,170
are and I think the public has a right
to know is there some

770
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,880
the huge are you know hard drive
repository somewhere in some customs

771
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,200
%uh building that has all kinds of hard
drives from the

772
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,690
seven-percent a business travelers were
having their their laptop seized

773
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,950
I every once in a while there should be
a mining the stuff is that happening

774
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,460
it could be and no one knows because no
public communication has been issued

775
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,280
about it so

776
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,630
we need to know a there's that the
Center for American Progress watch this

777
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,510
campaign

778
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:58,100
on Thursday its called hints of my
laptop dock

779
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,360
harm %ah the what their

780
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,520
this is like up server a serve a writing

781
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,830
campaign you you go to the website and
there's a form there and you can fill it

782
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,360
out and click send

783
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,700
handed sends comments to you the US
customs service

784
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,300
%uh in it asks them to perform that
privacy impact assessment that I mention

785
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,070
are there's a guy from cap here on he
told me that they have had

786
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,320
1700 different people sign up

787
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,730
a use this form in the past you know few
days the stings looks like Thursday or

788
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,580
Friday

789
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,860
us so that's pretty impressive I'm you
know if if

790
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,990
if we go out me mention our blogs in
like

791
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:40,580
a you know you could see a substantial
about people a

792
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,520
I'm North responding to this thing and
and that could have a big impact on

793
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,370
the perception that this is a niche
issue I'm you know that people need to

794
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,020
understand that

795
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,560
that there are a lot of people were
concerned about this are fortunately I

796
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,950
along those lines there was a also a New
York Times editorial about the subject a

797
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:59,100
few weeks ago so that was also help for

798
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,120
I and so well II before I i going to
questions

799
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,910
I i have one other comment about the
subject in general

800
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,299
and that is that you know people always
say you know I with

801
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:13,080
if you're not a criminal you've got
nothing to hide you know why are you

802
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,450
concerned about your privacy interest if
you're not up ten

803
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:19,520
no good right um and and a you know I'm
iris really thinking about that as a

804
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,720
ritz presentation so I wrote this this
this

805
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,630
ending comment and I think you know its
it's not really about whether or not

806
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,930
you've got something to hide

807
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,250
its it's about whether or not you have
to think about it I'll

808
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:34,120
a criminal lives life looking over
shoulder he doesn't he knows he's up to

809
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,089
no good he knows he could be targeted
for

810
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:39,290
because he's up to no good he knows
people are gonna be watchin em

811
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,080
and so he's got a costly a you to take
care of everything that he does he's got

812
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,340
a look and see if he's being spied upon
and

813
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:49,290
you know put things on urs mattress
Sarah yes to live in fear

814
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,150
a min users 11 for is up to no good a
business in people

815
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:57,240
should not have to live in fear a and
and and if they if there is a

816
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,340
if they're if they're being targeted by
the police at random

817
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,350
the mean you have to think every time
they do something you know

818
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:05,750
is this something that could be
misconstrued by the police when they go

819
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,980
through it are they gonna

820
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,420
they can get the wrong idea about us you
know what are they going to say if they

821
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:14,890
look at this maybe I just don't want you
know this item on here because I don't

822
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,470
want some

823
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,060
summoned some customs agent to look at
it just because it's I it's personal and

824
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:19,600
I

825
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,160
you know i i don't feel it's like it's
any other business now I think about it

826
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,690
every email I send every

827
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,470
every documents for my hard drive I
think what is customs gonna think about

828
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,740
this when I see it

829
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,660
and overtime you know this becomes
disorder self-censorship mechanism that

830
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,370
becomes in green people's heads

831
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:38,880
sir this is what happens in a press
societies and people become

832
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,290
a very paranoid and and the fact is that
they're

833
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,259
their their lives become diminished they
become dominated by the sphere

834
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,580
and and that's really what we're
fighting at it will change the nature of

835
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,980
our society or change we r and and and
that's why we can't allow this to

836
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,310
to go on so that's that's that's my talk

837
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,850
um so thank you very much for your time
is very important

838
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:03,850
the draw here listening listening to
this and that you took time out

839
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,100
to focus on this because it helps
communicate that this is important

840
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:14,100
I will take questions if you gottem some

841
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,819
ok solak question

842
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,280
arm there's an interesting approach to
data encryption that applies to the

843
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,050
subject

844
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,150
and there's a I Linux kernel module that
implements

845
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,640
it's called a rubber hose encryption
aren

846
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:39,609
the idea is today you have to pry the
keys

847
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,500
one day d crips the data in such a way
that

848
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,140
it's fake data and it's what you want
their depicting party to see

849
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,230
and then you have your real by the key
that the crips your real data is so i

850
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,590
was just wondering

851
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,710
what your opinion is on that approach

852
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,080
that's I mean it devil's in the details

853
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,930
and so I'm not familiar with that kinda
my droid have to go look it up and thank

854
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:04,390
you for

855
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,730
for mentioning it but it to it all
depends upon

856
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:11,210
up you know whether or not they can tell
that that tools running

857
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:15,030
if they know that tools running even if
they don't know um

858
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,140
that the that their secret data there

859
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,569
I it implies that their secret data
there and that gives them

860
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,400
a pretense with which to put pressure on
you

861
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,930
and the perturbing be be very
uncomfortable even if they don't

862
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:31,950
end up reading your your private
information might be better off having

863
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,650
them go through your email them to have
them put you in a room for three days

864
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,840
so that's something that that you are to
consider

865
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,700
I'm for fall excellent presentation
thank you thank you are just one quick

866
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,670
comment this doesn't change the problem
affected by any means

867
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,530
but may help somebody in a pitch I've
had my laptop searched randomly

868
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:54,520
several times in the airport I've never
had my flashdrive searched if it's in my

869
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,650
pocket

870
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,970
goes through with Mikey is nobody ever
bother so you know 12

871
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,120
20 gigs will fit in something like this
and its

872
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,819
it's never been searched yet so you
might wanna put your crib that stuff on

873
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,750
here and then your

874
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:12,060
less important stuff on a laptop for a
trip

875
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,730
I am i nichols et with the Center for
American Progress I just like to fill

876
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,170
some folks in on some details with the

877
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,270
I hands off my laptop action campaign if
you go to the page

878
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:25,560
%uh right now it pretty much just asks
for are

879
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,590
a bunch of your personal information so
I'd like to tell you what

880
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:32,450
radically for I like your address and
name and stuff like that

881
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:36,570
basically what we what what we're doing
is is where we're are very strategically

882
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:41,100
pushing them to do a privacy impact
assessment are specifically the CDP

883
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:43,050
upper management we're targeting the

884
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,330
are Commissioner Deputy Commissioner
chief-of-staff media relations and the

885
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,529
international travel specialists

886
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:53,020
and %uh basically if we can get them to
do a impact analysis we

887
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,680
we force them to talk about it and the
discussion space grows wider and that

888
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,740
will all play out on the hill better

889
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,610
are we directly talk to are the
lawmakers on the hill about this as well

890
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:04,480
it's not just

891
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,010
email flack and if you sign up for the
action campaign

892
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:11,800
down the road whenever we have to make
our next 30 jerk move like maybe six

893
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,080
months from now it's not a privacy
impact assessment were looking for but

894
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,259
it's something else that we need to keep
it moving

895
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:20,860
will email you back and tell you hey
this is the next thing you can do to

896
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,560
help this process along

897
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,590
are the numbers I got recently as OVR
Friday afternoon we had

898
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:31,250
1700 respondents if that are follows our
normal trends

899
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:35,670
it'll be about 7,000 by the end of the
week are so I really want to encourage

900
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:37,390
you to sign up for this

901
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,940
are we do really safeguard your privacy
are we think the odds have you winding

902
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:44,200
up on some type of watch list because
I've

903
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,560
getting on this action campaign is very
low and frankly if it happened it kinda

904
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,680
be a strategic win for us because

905
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,580
a lot of media people are on that are on
that seem less a lot lawmakers are on

906
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,810
that list and

907
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:00,560
a a lot of Pol you influential so just
thank you for your support

908
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:06,799
and and this important issue

909
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,120
hi thanks for such a a looser talk but I
am I I came in a bit late sometime

910
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,529
apologize if you dressed as but regards
the efficiency a random searches and

911
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:17,100
suggestion that we

912
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,720
you know you target people who are
suspicious and behavior and

913
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,570
you know is is have you heard the
carnival booth out with them and how

914
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:24,660
that might be

915
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,899
displays a weakness in that kind of up
screening so it was a very briefly the

916
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,970
idea is that

917
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,190
terrorist and operate in cells and this
is used as an argument against some %uh

918
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,960
that don't fly and profiling activity

919
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,420
so if normally USART randomly 5 percent
the time

920
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:44,100
you think I know on the target the bad
guys who list and I gotta do

921
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:48,770
Ste to my resources so that you know ten
twenty percent out the suspicious people

922
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,780
get searched

923
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,880
and only two percent of your regular
folks get searched

924
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,840
and then what happens is the terrorist
cell can go four dat start sending

925
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,950
people through clean

926
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,350
just absolutely no they're not really
about that is fine on the country

927
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,490
and eventually they will work out which
one of them are flagged in the system

928
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,640
for which one of them identified as
suspicious

929
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,730
and which one or not and the problem
happens is them because you no longer

930
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,130
around

931
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:13,540
researching you've dropped your chances
of detecting them from

932
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,029
120 which we five percent to maybe 150
which would be you know two percent or

933
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:18,920
something similar

934
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,480
so in that case and i cant for random
searches as opposed to trying to

935
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,250
more targeted searches such interest is
here response was to that

936
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:32,650
this interesting I i havent to so that
did you see the carnival booth

937
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:35,760
up

938
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,520
okay I well um I i yah I don't have a
key in the answer to that

939
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:44,140
um so you know I one thing I will point
out

940
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,420
is that there is this thing called ATS
which is automated targeting system

941
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,120
it's a pretty basic profiling tool that
customs uses at US borders it looks at

942
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:54,670
things like

943
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:58,330
when you buy your ticket what your name
is um you know what your what phone

944
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,490
number you gave

945
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:03,000
what address you gave it cetera et
cetera on your undertake at

946
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,960
it's been the subject of a fair amount
of controversy there's we are conflicts

947
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,270
between it and you privacy laws there's

948
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,870
privacy groups and US you who thought it
was a a

949
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,609
too expensive are and at least a few
years ago I think some changes were made

950
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,240
to I'm not sure if everyone's cool with
it now or not

951
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:23,620
up but you know they'd they did identify
one individual

952
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:29,630
are who came into you I %uh the United
States in in minnesota or Minneapolis

953
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,380
nurse Minnesota a you know through
through this process so

954
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:36,740
so they did identify somebody this way
the

955
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,950
the number I've terrorist in verses the
whole number people that are traveling

956
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:41,720
in this country

957
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,110
every day is extremely small and so

958
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:50,340
you know it you you may find that it's
very very difficult to to to actually

959
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,210
happen to find someone repulsive what
are the mir using when you really look

960
00:49:54,210 --> 00:49:56,250
at the the real numbers but a

961
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,700
II will take a look at it thanks for
bring that up

962
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,750
I appreciated your presentation as a
civil rights and criminal defense

963
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,120
attorney though I wanted to point out

964
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:09,319
that the distinction that you made
between I

965
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,580
innocent people having a look over their
shoulder and criminals

966
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,040
you suggested on might have to look over
their shoulders

967
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:21,200
i think is too fast so and maybe you you
were thinking in terms of

968
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,570
real criminals hardened criminals
terrorists but apart from the fact the

969
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:25,800
criminals have rights too

970
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,480
of course the distinction between
criminal an innocent

971
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,300
on is much more nuanced than really
breaks down me not only do we have

972
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,120
I increasing numbers flagrantly
unconstitutional

973
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:40,660
criminal statutes in this country these
days measured against any

974
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,660
any reasonable standard of what's
constitutional means so much so

975
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,410
I me really gone through the
looking-glass even in trying to discuss

976
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,279
these things

977
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,280
on in a kinda constitutional framework
I'm but they're there

978
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,100
myriad ways I mean you know this isn't
the the place to address the myriad ways

979
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,180
in which

980
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:02,250
on seizure a private material can be
used against people

981
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,280
who are technically technically broken
laws under some stature but used for

982
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,090
really insidious and military is
purposes I mean probing

983
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:14,310
you know what what really announce to
thought crime in prosecutions the target

984
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:16,620
people for ideas in speeches

985
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:20,569
I'm and constitute full frontal assaults
on the first amendment is this

986
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:24,390
I I absolutely agree with with I think
both the arguments for making I think me

987
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,529
two distinct ones

988
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:28,920
are I guess the reason I can focus on
them in that particular statement is

989
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,640
that I think the people who raise the
objection that if you're not a criminal

990
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:32,879
you've nothing to hide

991
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,310
you know believe that the police are
always up forthright in what they're

992
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:36,940
doing

993
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:39,990
a and and believe that the laws that we
have are always reasonable

994
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:43,370
are and I neither those assumptions is
cracked but

995
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:47,290
a you know i i think there are you even
if you accept those two assertions

996
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,900
that there are there reasons why you
might reject a policy

997
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,170
I've freedom searches and so basically
that's the reasoning for

998
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:00,980
for the way they represent things but
thank you thank you for saying that

999
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,030
I just once it's really not at the
border anymore

1000
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:07,970
if you're traveling a college student
upstate New York Syracuse and where

1001
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:08,620
their

1002
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,960
if they're not very white author Asian
if they're dark

1003
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,720
they will be pulled off that bus the
CEREC use bus station

1004
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,000
that's a long way from the Canadian
border by Homeland Security

1005
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,270
and custom and they will ask you for
your papers

1006
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,080
%uh there was a a decision that said
that the the border zone

1007
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,240
extends to several hundred miles outside
order

1008
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,340
as long as like its customs officials in
the are they claim to be on some sort of

1009
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,980
Porter related business

1010
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:39,420
them you know like the pool this
specific hotfix was a car that was

1011
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:39,990
pulled over

1012
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,790
vermont like a hundred miles from the
border a an eight they argue that it was

1013
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:47,060
a border search well I'm a professor at
the University up there

1014
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:50,680
and they particularly when for anyone
that was for looking

1015
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:54,290
and they went down the aisle the bus and
said where are your pet perks

1016
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,500
their to everybody so

1017
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,030
I now but there was the students got
pretty test of a meter

1018
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,940
they were very shocked at that served as
to be aware

1019
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:09,500
runnin close to then the time folks but
all

1020
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,950
the questions until they kick us out yep
I got okay one more special quick

1021
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,320
questions one

1022
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:19,000
sorry want

1023
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,550
all which well than a I came

1024
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:26,700
fear from Chicago via Amtrak

1025
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:32,770
and in erie pennsylvania Border Patrol
also gets on the Amtrak train

1026
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:37,340
and asks everyone me you know are you an
american

1027
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:41,880
in if you say no they asked for your
papers you know can make stand

1028
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,200
searching your stuff to that till when
you're

1029
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,000
why not near a border that's a that's an
interesting question

1030
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,500
I hadn't I didn't know that I hadn't
read I've never read a case

1031
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:58,000
about that a but that that implies that
the question hasn't been answered

1032
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,260
so so it may be but something that could
they could at least get away with until

1033
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:03,040
they had a quarter told in the couldn't

1034
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,860
yeah are so well anyway I guess I gotta
call this but thank you very much for

1035
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,540
your time and I'll be happy to profit

1036
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:14,779
good

1037
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:18,380
not really a question just just a quick
comment missing

1038
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:18,630
is
