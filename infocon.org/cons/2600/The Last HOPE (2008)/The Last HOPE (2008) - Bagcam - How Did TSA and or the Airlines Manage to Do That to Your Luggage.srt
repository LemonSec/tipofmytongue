means of transportation these days and
every time you open your luggage you

find more those nice little notices from
the TSA that they've gone through your

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,420
goods

20

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,080
I hold a private pilot certificate so I
have a little bit insight into

49
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,000

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,310
in quotes there I'm eat flyer means I
get screwed by the airlines more than

have reviewed on miles

53
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:18,090
arm my girlfriend was in alaska so you

54
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,860
those trips

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,500

experts in this industry is how like a

57
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,629
lot industries

58
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,939

cut talk about what that cam is

63
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,280
how I built it mom smother information
about it

64
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,110
and then getting some video that I have
a flights

65
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,480
on including flight out here from
indianapolis

66
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,670
so why back and I talked about that a
little bit

67
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,150
when I started he security by for side

68
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,420
it's absolutely ridiculous and we see it
more more

69
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,500
every day and understand why are there
was talk about security after 9/11

70
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,630
oh my god got a secure everything gotta
be secure all let's make something up

71
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,779
the only thing secure

72
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,870
but let's pretend we have security all
security let's make

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,660
skirt lines longer belsky Kira cuz terra
firma wait in line

74
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,840
you know i mean it's its it's just
insane

75
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,440
and it infuriates me I think did you get
to see only snap

76
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,960
understanding the security line kinda an
interesting side note was flying out

77
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,758
here

78
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,380
I got harassed a little bit more than
normal in the security line

79
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,440
and guy right behind me worked for
homeland security

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,729
has Homeland Security sir on his
homeland security id:

81
00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:52,949
and he got screwed even harder than I
did

82
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,590
I destroyed Lapan were like you know
putting our shoes on it

83
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,050
put everything back in her carry-on bag
out again like putting the twenty camera

84
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,569
back on my camera because you know those
pipe bomb behind there are some god only

85
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,940
knows

86
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,030
and he just had just woke up just hatred
on his face towards the TSA

87
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,960
as SWAT team sponsored I know how you
feel

88
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,270
I'll pick you found to be funny I did

89
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,810
soho over the justice there

90
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,020
so as I said history by facade

91
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,139
I really was suspicious about airport
security

92
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,400
it just seems dubious it doesn't seem
like it accomplishes much it seems like

93
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,050
there's lot better ways that you could

94
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,120
securing airports secure flights for the
city you've been to Europe

95
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,900
you can see security there is a lot less
invasive I think it's a lot more done

96
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,180
arm I don't feel comfortable clusters
dogs running around luggage

97
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,060
the cheap the effective to a release
from millions of dollars like poking

98
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,110
around with

99
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,539
equipment and you know all these
ridiculous things

100
00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,030
ridiculous is kind of a common theme in
my opinion

101
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,000
and security the airlines at the airport
TSA

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,669
especially given what we spend on it

103
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:13,299
and as I said before I had one too many
of these guys show for my luggage

104
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,030
start building a collection of these
things have a staff at home

105
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,460
how do you guys have got wannabes Wow

106
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,270
also expected to be like maybe a quarter
to half

107
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,599
guest house private eighty percent of
people raise their hands their

108
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:34,940
so callow is bad cam constructed

109
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,550
it's a mini DVR with built-in camera

110
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,830
this is actually the DVR with camera to
use my best pitch for the coming up

111
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,740
saying see its tiny it's got a 128 Meg

112
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,770
onboard memory a USB port on it

113
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,409
he also played an empty cart but UNC
card either

114
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,870
is crap that I got or it doesn't read it
I don't know what but I didn't work so

115
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,150
base was gonna 128 Meg lumber memory on
recordings also you later

116
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,370
word on 820 820 fifteen frames per
second

117
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,069
which gives you a lot of time on 128 mag
I don't know it works out

118
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:17,780
speech to the guy in fact compression in
all types of variance

119
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,169
up but you can easily get 10 hours plus
on their

120
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,669
arm side to go with this a concert some
other options because solid-state

121
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:31,099
there's no moving parts and it was the
same going through

122
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:34,479
being x-rayed having such spinning
around turning and also I was just blown

123
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,250
off

124
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,370
that was a political it because I get
the video that before got blown up

125
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,639
Chris provide these problems later on
arm

126
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,530
so the site was piped us to go with

127
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,629
the DVR solid-state one are supposed
twenty-some recording

128
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:55,789
are ritually I plan on using a different
DVR

129
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:59,479
that had an external camera and our

130
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,780
that didn't work out

131
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,240
this is one I originally planned on
using are meeting at this thing online

132
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,919
for

133
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,109
about 250 I think these things are cheap
I'll

134
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,129
but I really wanna know what's going on
Etsy like is this way

135
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,259
accepted died literally the day before

136
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:23,650
5 planned flight for backing down and I
bought this other one

137
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,770
and I'll stripes I which was gonna use
so

138
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,009
side go toward built in camera on you
see the summer months

139
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,659
tiny as well this is the one else is
holding up earlier

140
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,600
so you can see if not it might be in
there

141
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,940
what I end up doing was

142
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,020
putting this in the bag if it is nice
about this

143
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,439
is it comes with this clamshell

144
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,710
thing that you can put together there's
another piece it's actually in the back

145
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,420
there

146
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,920
arm in this is supposed to be called for
so you can like walk around nobody's

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,939
gonna see you right

148
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,620
okay whatever arm but is convenient
could think we want the same since I

149
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,040
drove back

150
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,140
he's put this in there but the other one
in their staff together

151
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,080
I found out that sometimes tried once on
flights you know

152
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,220
what she gets what happens the first
flight I took back am

153
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,460
major turbulence crap going all over the
place the camera actually got knocked

154
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,410
out so now I take the thing in there as
well as like

155
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,680
snappy getting there on set something
else to consider if you do

156
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,980
decide to build your own backyard it's
going to get

157
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,860
be pretty hard actually how 20 rights
you want here's the video of it

158
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,370
so that those are the most interesting
things which I i still havent got

159
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,900
any really damning video yet but justice
America time

160
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,280
come wonders what things you know when
you need to get somewhere the flight

161
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,390
always gets delayed

162
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:47,330
it's kinda like you've got a camera bag
I don't know if the notice said like

163
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,340
cool we

164
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:52,630
workers stay away from that arm but
eventually

165
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,770
it'll catch up to all men will get
something interesting there's still some

166
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,579
interesting for its place as I think
really

167
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:01,400
damning yet arm have you have my back
search sense

168
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,550
I put the camera in there its insane to
use its search but ninety percent time

169
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,750
so big maybe it's we need to do if they
can actually get through and

170
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,700
every back shortly packed it as opposed
air water close crumpled up in

171
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,470
wanted of like did you guys go out your
way to make

172
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,990
my life difficult already know the
answer that would only

173
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,780
so what i did. was I cut a hole inside
if I I bought a cheap bag

174
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,819
arm call whole side other

175
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,200
I decide to go with the luggage tag is
prolly can't see it but there's like

176
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,940
wal-mart place up there

177
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,730
arm this is well some plastic I watched

178
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,350
cheap I wanna gas such a cut in an aisle
i no free Out on your

179
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,480
social is my one back to Pisa plastic

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
cut a hole in it clue to the insight
that way you're a fool people outside it

181
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,640
remains intact and free out you don't
lose your camera or something later on

182
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,350
the shows the clamps only goes around
the DVR

183
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,810
and I Canada staff together pretty
straightforward their

184
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,160
one-sided this is glued to the inside
the bad

185
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,300
know my say about this bag is it has
like why many consider open so I guess

186
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,640
you can change

187
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,920
but though though Campbell plane you
know if you break your whatever

188
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,719
also makes a nice for hiding your camera
up in there

189
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,650
slowly close up little bit closer
pitcher up the DVR

190
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,189
arm this one costs about five hundred
dollars

191
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,820
but it's nice and that it's got an LCD
screen so you can go through there in

192
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,440
quickly

193
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,150
scan through see what you got arm

194
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:42,189
it's got a lot of motion detection
features on it it's

195
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,310
free full-featured others and cheaper
ways

196
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,640
doing it like the 1i showed earlier so
was 250 and

197
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,660
you can get even cheaper are another
advance this is as lithium ion battery

198
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,280
on its rechargeable

199
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,140
I've gotten up to 10 hours on it I
haven't made it all the way from an

200
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,910
apples to encourage

201
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,069
arm so it's it's die somewhere like the
ten to twelve hour range looks like if

202
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,830
you set it on the power savings mode

203
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:15,830
that's neither pitcher if you walk was a
little hole

204
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,770
so right there on the corner is actually
the whole the cameras walking through

205
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:26,520
once considered if you do this is camera
placement

206
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,800
you need to think about callback to spur
handle

207
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,420
so you have the best chance of getting
real footage not staring right up

208
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,599
against the wall

209
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,860
on typically when you have backs like
this they threw them face-down

210
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,070
so this is the front of it the wheels
are back here

211
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:48,270
gonna throw down like that they do that
so then roll around

212
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,680
so it's pretty safe bet for on site
which got a 50-50 chance of working at

213
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,340
something decent

214
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,800
and Sony flip back and forth so you do a
few flights and you can get some footage

215
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,970
see what's going on

216
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,690
and we see what your baggage handling
system the airport CTS a way out see

217
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,380
what

218
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,960
doing back there which turns out isn't
much

219
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,470
that's why does the wall except in
Anchorage

220
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:12,850
it's done and will that was kinda
interesting some the differences between

221
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,090
airports and

222
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,660
hell TSA ducks itself

223
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,660
try to be somewhat inconspicuous it
really doesn't matter because nobody's

224
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,120
expecting this

225
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,990
so people aren't like looking around
your bag which is our camera in it

226
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,270
and I'm sure many people here have had
done

227
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:34,150
cover surveillance or whatever you wanna
call it

228
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,069
arm ended shocking just help would use
most people are in society

229
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,260
and this is just another example so
don't don't obsess about it

230
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,110
what I did on this one was I went where
the

231
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,830
ID tag is on luggage

232
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,290
so if you look on the site here got the
ID tag it up here

233
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,040
also has the advantage of the camera has
motion detection in it

234
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,219
so if it doesn't see any change the
picture for like

235
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,590
five seconds it's configurable it'll
shut off for a while

236
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,790
sick or turn the camera off because or
something you don't want on it or

237
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,810
whatever

238
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,230
you just pull the ER luggage tag up on
it

239
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,570
because I don't use for real with my
name on it for that but

240
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,830
to cover the whole law cameras of

241
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,340
right free dropped back off just how
slide it down for handing it over to him

242
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,960
cams on so that's kinda nice

243
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,930
army in case you know you're on your way
to the airport and

244
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,610
you have issues with things like speed
limit and you know you don't want your

245
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,500
camera videoing you

246
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,240
doing something illegal in case you get
caught later on and then you have a

247
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,350
camera on all types of things

248
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,910
your god only knows what time you guys
how we do our way to the airport

249
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,189
style miss Polly worse the thing I can't
even imagine

250
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,640
I played only want to know what somebody
right

251
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,670
actually i'm curious cell

252
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,830
the person is the best or the catches up
with me at a bar later I'll buy you a

253
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,810
drank how's that

254
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,930
so this is the inside the bag again you
know it's just a Pakistani big deal here

255
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:14,090
arm zipper down at unzip it

256
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,990
cut the hole in it have a white car back
there too so you can see the size the

257
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,960
whole I was pretty big on the whole
decided what crop the video of too much

258
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,020
for risk

259
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,860
camera moving around arm again you don't
need to obsess about those people just

260
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,240
aren't what for it

261
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,110
early-stage didn't use to look for it

262
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:38,070
considerations for building your own
back

263
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,550
this is probably the standard
disclaimers you see in most talks right

264
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,870
you may want to seek legal advice don't
do anything

265
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:48,660
stupid you might hear it a people so

266
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,810
you know if they open up we find it it
might be an inconvenience

267
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:57,320
probably should not make your first back
in flight and important flight

268
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,210
what you for going somewhere to
interview don't make that you from your

269
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,030
back same flight

270
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:07,060
and do not require audio army any
questions on Adam I can get into my new

271
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,540
show

272
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,250
of certificates audio recording but if
you look at 18 USC

273
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,840
section 2510 I A covers all about in

274
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,130
basically don't go there arm

275
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,490
video seems to be fair game our

276
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,030
and did it seems to be fair game crossed
work most states

277
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,400
again my one seek legal advice my
attorney

278
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:34,400
level alright arm the laws for audio
recording be recording

279
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,990
vary dramatically from state to state
that something else you might want to

280
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,990
consider

281
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,480
tense the you might want to seek legal
advice

282
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,520
video one things I learn

283
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,590
make sure you have useful video you can
extract before your first flight

284
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:54,260
yeah I should check that arm

285
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,990
so this DVR thing

286
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,790
it records it in some bastardized impact
for format

287
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:06,390
and there's a slight crappy program that
runs under Windows was written by budget

288
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,910
koreans

289
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,199
arm yes issue decree and if you don't
like the resources file

290
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,199
were Korean in there than there is
English

291
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,810
are it only once a tense up for 1024 by
768

292
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:22,290
image it's just its scrap

293
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:25,520
boycott okay well you know converts
video with that no big deal

294
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,040
gonna live in some usable format great
so took my first flight get back up got

295
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,300
like I'll 50-60 megavideo

296
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,790
on the way out on the way back and I run
the program it charts the charge such

297
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,909
August

298
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,850
couple hours later at like girls or guys
cause crack

299
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,980
so for my own presentation actually
turkey

300
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,120
camcorder Mike videoing of the screen
what will we get over it

301
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,830
night he got the job done arm I did some
work on what you up file format

302
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,280
and awe actually managed to talk some
people at Swan

303
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,649
new makes this thing arm or put your
name on it

304
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:05,080
I said quickly and some cream from
actually makes it and want to get

305
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,260
through to the guys that are in

306
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,160
Australia there hopefuls much they could
be it'll have much information

307
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,940
on but they they were trying and
frontline

308
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,820
quite used to work with on worse a
different company called exact

309
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,110
technologies now

310
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,710
identify key cameras help me out as well

311
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:25,250
Ann Summers Pierce I want to thank TSP
there and exact

312
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,560
for be lending some other time expertise
there

313
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,310
so yes we do see some footage and what
actually happened back there

314
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,629
no cash

315
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:43,660
we'll get to that after the slime keep
keep this in mind when you watch this

316
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,500
TSA has 43,000 place okay not not too
much given number airports in the US

317
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,150
right

318
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,030
their budget for this year for fiscal
2008

319
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,940
6.4 billion basically six and a half
billion dollars almost five billion the

320
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,850
previous year articles hired year before
that

321
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,580
so they belong ridiculous amounts of
money

322
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:09,980
we still feel the street us there or not
it's

323
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:16,980
so just keep that in mind

324
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,300
what the first light side so it was in
Annapolis to DCA

325
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,669
and I got some some footage there I
could we converted

326
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,740
arch has a file corrupted in the way is
anything interesting going on

327
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,860
every good nationalist think that there
would be the isn't sons gonna skip that

328
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:44,880
not bore you with like bags bouncing
around I from annapolis in case you can

329
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,940
figure that out from like my flights

330
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,640
and see how it works

331
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,680
decent up there doesn't it you guys see
okay cool

332
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,290
you want a full screen one-third

333
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,470
it's going to come up pixelated but will
try it here

334
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,660
better worse okay so

335
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:14,660
this is the ticket counter in Annapolis
and were for waiting

336
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,720
because that's what you take out a lot
awaiting Air Force so finally they grab

337
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,430
my luggage

338
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,220
this is an American Airlines flight case
you can figure that out

339
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,350
and course we wat

340
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,740
I've cut out most the waiting

341
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,840
because dislike hours of waiting there's

342
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,290
the guy's crotch you picked up for what
you put on the to be avail fortune was

343
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,149
close enough we couldn't see any detail
on it

344
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,630
so now the bag is sitting on the side

345
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:46,820
and it's getting rate go down the
conveyor belt back behind the ticket

346
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,330
counter

347
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:54,330
which brings us to the next one

348
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,450
and off we go

349
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:12,450
that's going through the wall curtain
thing that you see there

350
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,370
operating speed this up a bowl mix was
gonna be running down conveyor belts

351
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:21,800
here as we get to the TSA

352
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:28,800
so you can see we're certainly move

353
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:42,370
it's kinda funny witty speeded-up like
kinda nesting ride

354
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,610
yeah sack some don't tell miss you we go

355
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,320
yup

356
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,620
and do it almost makes me wanna get
drunk in like see if I could check

357
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,340
myself

358
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,549
the but I'm sure I'd wake up in my

359
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:03,100
like cargo hold be like all me and this
will avoid bad idea later on

360
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:07,379
skullcap four times we get really
trashed his neck sup

361
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:11,269
if you look at this these are the
machines that they actually do you

362
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,119
the x-ray and the background scanning
machines in that that's what we were

363
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,439
diving down of love on me you can see
one

364
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,450
if you look off to you're left there

365
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,809
that's the ramp we came down and you can
see another one the background scan

366
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:27,450
machines

367
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,119
off to your right and you can sort of
see the red shirt up the TSA their

368
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,259
Pete fact that the EV controls voices on
top because

369
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:39,909
you think what's the video more than the
controls

370
00:22:39,909 --> 00:22:46,909
well

371
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,040
so this is TSA it in Annapolis so he
grabbed the bag

372
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,250
after we drop down a conveyor belt
literature guys out there

373
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,320
working hard I

374
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,980
for that sixty billion dollars guess
you're right there I think it's a shame

375
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,250
for the people but

376
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:15,250
they're both just about as effective I
thank and we've just gone through TSA

377
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,139
screening

378
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,630
was it an oppressive now

379
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:29,040
so now we know that I'm not a terrorist
was not a bomb in a bag because you know

380
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,180
they're talking to each other and

381
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,820
they decided that

382
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,830
and so now we go down we compare notes
just on this is more

383
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,039
airline part of it here dougherty

384
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:46,809
baggage cart that the used to watch out
to the rampant get it on the plane

385
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:53,629
I think we get a

386
00:23:53,629 --> 00:23:59,129
secondary were kept your say on this one
as with the back its

387
00:23:59,129 --> 00:24:03,399
tossed around a little bit again those
are the baggage carts they take to watch

388
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:04,109
out to

389
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:11,109
the plan on and I think if we get done

390
00:24:12,049 --> 00:24:15,668
rotating around us a little bit will see
the TSA guys come back into view

391
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:19,320
was go around here so with a picture
like it off based on what flight is

392
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,570
those one things that surprised me why
did this in a star look at the footage

393
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:27,580
is just how be able to start as I
figured there be light you know any

394
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,509
cargo handling

395
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:31,619
sure what that UPS or FedEx behind the
scenes have are make pushers

396
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:37,499
pushed off of thats TSA guy how was like
he can use working harder 18 what's up

397
00:24:37,499 --> 00:24:40,799
and there we go now

398
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,799
there's one at the

399
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:51,460
background scanning machines can't quite
be it looks like in

400
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,960
vision or something so what it is

401
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,309
on

402
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,859
when it was dark you like free if you
came down the ramp for psych and

403
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,289
that's when I went through the machine
it wasn't in there for very long

404
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:11,389
in there is a lot of stuff in it back to
you

405
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:15,979
that's another picture of it that's the
exit

406
00:25:15,979 --> 00:25:19,580
coming out of one the round hole there
and %ah

407
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,678
fats comment on the video we do the like
who

408
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,820
as we went through their and

409
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,820
TSA hard work back there

410
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:44,560
and again to build a better picture of
the machines there's a ton of America

411
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:44,840
and

412
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,270
they are cheap right rusher with the
prices on those things

413
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,889
but start adding that up so now we just
keep going around the course all until

414
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:58,300
an airline employee decides that ok that
back east of light

415
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,330
they're uncovering and they believe just
with tags and the pool of

416
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,510
was no scanning there's no automation
least I didn't nap force

417
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:12,600
and yeah exactly a comment from down
here was

418
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,580
work what happened when he tried to
automate everything in Denver for those

419
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,220
who don't know

420
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:20,550
complete disaster they basically had to
just destroy all the baggage stop

421
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,629
and we do it all they just didn't work
on

422
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:28,020
I flew through the neutral African
National are the US Airways from which

423
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,780
is open

424
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:32,570
several years got mine because ten years
go now a food through their the first

425
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,000
day

426
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,120
they have automated gave announcements
and two-way announcements

427
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,210
the computer got screwed up it's also
announcing delays for flights

428
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:42,820
didn't get too late so people showing up
the wrong gate republican our

429
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,679
wait for their flight because no
announced whites played and they're all

430
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,040
like

431
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,190
arm now the airline play love

432
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,130
gate agents like are the flight left on
time like well as the was announced it

433
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,770
was too late

434
00:26:54,770 --> 00:27:00,860
gauge like yell play really wasn't there
a lot of pissed off people there

435
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:05,330
I got screwed by whether I spent 12
hours sitting like what it at national

436
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:05,870
that day

437
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:12,870
so I have to watch all of it it was fine

438
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,850
so officially gets rolled the conveyor
stop out back up for it well

439
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,810
spin when this much they're any make it
out onto the ramp

440
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:29,010
hopefully and

441
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:36,010
up four-wheeler we go a sound effects
for this

442
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:44,360
yeah i i should what's up I

443
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:51,360
for and wind up inside the cargo hold
the plane

444
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,850
so that's what you see out there you
know where we yesterday because

445
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,760
the flight got delayed or they lost the
aircraft for god only knows what they

446
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,140
did

447
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,070
I just forgot they had a plane sitting
there in had that happen one time they

448
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,800
forgot to

449
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,190
first flight of the day out at an
airport the forgot to on

450
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,670
anger the aircraft yeah the airline

451
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:19,400
thought it was an ATC delay because
Council I told them that the way below

452
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,780
the called about all the check

453
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,530
so an hour later I'm getting I great
cause I food travel times and Pittsburgh

454
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,590
minute plane overnight it there so I
asked them

455
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,850
and she said what ATC delay like what

456
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:35,890
your cycle tower up now

457
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,050
there's no ATC delay arm

458
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,740
so I mention this to Oregon and

459
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:49,740
of a sudden she had a social walk so
this is coming off the plane

460
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,560
you know something you made it there the
aircraft me they are you like it all

461
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,820
three of them we get

462
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,379
tossed around a little bit now he

463
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,490
I don't watch too close else on the
schedule motion sickness

464
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:11,850
it's like watching someone once I was
reviewing else like United step back

465
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,690
away from that a little

466
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,480
besides banning high quality video but
for some reason I don't know what it is

467
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,890
might just be me I might work what lee
video that I did like the 2nd 3rd

468
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:22,770
generation stock

469
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,910
Heathrow disorienting and %ah

470
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,820
this is a flight in 20 here again so
this is ideally what you want to see at

471
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,639
the end of your

472
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,800
journey at least the interview jury at
the airport

473
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,250
so week go around and around

474
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,400
we wind our way through there's bound
our love going through conveyor belt at

475
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,360
o'hare to get from

476
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,630
be plane out to baggage claim

477
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:52,720
also now realize why extender and wait
for about an hour

478
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,720
for the band show up

479
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,930
and pop we go on to the care so lehrer
and I

480
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,490
was sitting right there in rapid this is
at the bottom I think yup

481
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:16,450
snapple that's a long as I walk out at
o'hare this was Easter weekend

482
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,090
and you go up to here for soccer Chicago
for something

483
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,210
and I thought out Easter weekend and you
know

484
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,820
whereby sorry gonna give a destination
this is a Saturday

485
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,040
flight it was insane and wife last
Sunday

486
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,320
the cat had to like drop me off

487
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,340
Walker to from the airport was taking
like two hours to get

488
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,340
just with the drop-off line there star

489
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:44,070
a mouse course the scandal here for you
I don't know what else taking flying

490
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,580
through their

491
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:49,320
and

492
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,540
as I said before ago from whatsapp in
Anchorage alaska

493
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:58,240
so I fly up there on a regular basis
missus

494
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:05,240
one of the flights up there

495
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:14,640
the other flight was American Airlines
this is a US Airways flight here

496
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,100
and this is

497
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,040
have to carry can an easy to backs

498
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,040
compare go back there we get tossed onto
it

499
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:41,450
and then off we go for a ride here

500
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,740
again this is what your souls they just
they they said the bags out to these

501
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,929
locations may dislike

502
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:52,080
rotate on the carousels arm until they
get picked off by airline flies I think

503
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,230
I have any that footage I have some
footage but

504
00:31:54,230 --> 00:32:01,230
trust me it's it's pouring think this is
or not a difficult the faster

505
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:09,559
so here we are wonderful Inc aerosols

506
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,580
impact think that was carried going to
TSA's area

507
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:26,259
them I think that was one fights ready

508
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:29,389
CTS a the back foot around probably and
so

509
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:36,389
butts had blackwell's looking out for
large portion of light

510
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:46,080
this is a shot bags stack up and models
wore carts

511
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,280
saying seem kinda from bags and now
they're

512
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,230
will speed up to three times

513
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:00,230
be so makes it look like he's work in
reasonable face

514
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,830
just slow down that last part there I'm
sure that was at that speed

515
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:14,000
that might have been getting up in a
plane there

516
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
see now anything interesting

517
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:29,860
this is the place of going up in the
plane

518
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:34,960
cell pulled out the car on toward
baggage loader

519
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,960
up we go hopefully into the crack
aircraft

520
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:53,959
now sometimes the way they would bags

521
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:58,579
cracks me up arm will face this flight
up in a minute here

522
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:03,299
there's also some ghetto video there had
two previously

523
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:08,268
this is a flight to LaGuardia and

524
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:12,029
I don't know how it's going it's more
exercise

525
00:34:12,029 --> 00:34:16,440
so sure we are going up the baggage
loader

526
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,668
we tossed and turned all that this was
great shepper footage because we're

527
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:21,199
looking anything interesting here right
now

528
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,419
it's almost like i am new to head camera
there side to help me out

529
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,618
so he's like what his mother bags brown

530
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,829
and he's like oh his camera can't see
anything

531
00:34:32,829 --> 00:34:37,819
of except for I'm so it turns around
sweet watching well-dressed backs

532
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:42,819
appreciated that almost one in like find
out who he was

533
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:47,679
and like what when I was little you know
I appreciate his diligence

534
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,490
until I saw my ex parte so we stand up
here

535
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,929
i'll know what I say into the the guy
down there

536
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:02,929
but apparently he gets a little
impatient

537
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
right now just animated

538
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,480
slices screw it and he jumps out a
second here

539
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:29,290
area

540
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:36,290
now the spear the bag floating improve
substantially

541
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:42,740
he must be yelling at the guy that was
down there right now not quite sure

542
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,740
what's going on

543
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:54,840
will get to this point for your hair ago
yeah

544
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,320
so for I drop back down to normal speed
so you can watch that again

545
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:07,320
to get this is a high-speed this is a
small must be here right

546
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:15,100
food yeah scar the conveyor belt school

547
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,770
off the backs up in there that's why
those right there where I realized

548
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:22,860
all that's how they do that that's how
they broke that

549
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:29,060
yeah it still cracks me up to me

550
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:34,970
is just like lobbing those things and
they're that's near post 320

551
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,920
which differ from lawyer with the cargo
hold is pretty high off the ground units

552
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,190
of

553
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:46,190
like here

554
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,800
when speed video back of the car wash
shopping bags around in here

555
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,340
to

556
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:02,710
there you go yeah

557
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:06,700
now it's almost like you what's routes
like the by Seattle now

558
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:13,700
now like the ass if I didn't see it
people will curtain down for the close

559
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,520
though

560
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,940
cargo door that one was shipped around
the open door up to fall on top of him

561
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,720
%uh this was US Airways

562
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,300
and this is PR northeast

563
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,349
shuttle that they're on the run Airbus
320 is the goalie

564
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:35,680
New York DC entr the other couple cities
that

565
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:39,290
a slight our police service up and down
through their arm

566
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:45,050
it's actually nice to ride on but that's
not why the flights guy would want to

567
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,530
get drunk

568
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,310
in check myself on by the way that's why
it's a bad idea

569
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:56,310
so going up to in Annapolis

570
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:02,839
I fly to Phoenix to stay for so far
north it doesn't matter because several

571
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,930
hundred miles to the west it still same
distance

572
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:08,720
yup

573
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,300
and this is just loading an Airbus 320
here

574
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:21,300
but this is offloading the 322 I flew on

575
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,230
and here we are sitting on one at the
talks probably

576
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:37,750
or am I just be sitting on the ground
you see the other plaintiffs in their

577
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:44,750
push back to health by plane to flee
when I can remember

578
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,610
answers loading onto the 319 319 is an
Airbus 320

579
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,080
he has less seats on its always love
that lasts longer distance

580
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:18,080
and that's why take from Phoenix up tank
which usually

581
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,359
so here we are riding around

582
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,520
sees signs but we decided to camp across
their will be interesting on some the

583
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,550
freezer so year

584
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:44,550
in just a second

585
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:59,670
and off we go up into the plain

586
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,299
and somewhere on the way up to Anchorage
the battery on the DVR died on me so I

587
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,730
don't want any more footage that flight
on

588
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:15,070
exits and entrances baggage handling
coming off the plane in Anchorage

589
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:20,250
this is a flight out the bank which

590
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:25,350
arm this is about this is in the airport
parking lot

591
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:30,799
taken under ambient light conditions
this was two days after summer solstice

592
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,400
this year this is about 1 a.m. yeah

593
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,530
says there's lights on

594
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:43,310
but me can clearly see things you've got
Lites it was it was bizarre its first

595
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,880
met been up there in the North
summer-like

596
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,980
so here at the ticket counter

597
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,650
now what do you perceive things about
CSA

598
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:56,390
at a original post the video for second
produced your backs disappearing

599
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,890
DC does the magic kinda see what to do
now and acreage

600
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:04,129
this have little roped-off area right
out there in five everybody

601
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:08,170
and so you've got a ticket counter the
tag you're bad carrier bag over

602
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,310
you hand it to him any to scan
everything right there in front of you

603
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:15,210
endured officially it's just amazing

604
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,560
but its consequences or by his guns up
there is it really helps

605
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,009
before nice the efficient the wasn't
even ask you when you drop her back off

606
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:27,920
at Anchorage

607
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,340
you can to the TSA guy he walks re
firearms

608
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,530
now so the first time yes it now

609
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,050
like it's okay if you have weapons just
have to clear like I don't heavy weapons

610
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,650
but now he just needed to clear that
Sonic I don't heavy weapons okay

611
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:47,160
I'm sorry I'm unarmed

612
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,770
I'm the only person within 100 miles of
here I know that

613
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:53,800
so here we are

614
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,680
turn it over there you can see the TSA
guy can stay out when you open

615
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,839
there's this one does little broke
barriers things you can't storm

616
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:07,510
they scan when you get around to it
quick

617
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:14,510
easy efficient and here's the joyride
through the old terminal

618
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,400
in Anchorage sit around the open once
you say gets done with it they put it

619
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,600
back on the conveyor belt behind the
ticket counter sir look at the back of

620
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,640
the ticket counter there

621
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,750
help

622
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:38,000
and around her so we all know that's one
will be fine but then I wouldn't be such

623
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,360
a carnival for 12 hours

624
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:46,360
what's out well

625
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:52,020
yeah connie was was screaming babies but
but when the advances I'll

626
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:59,020
ridiculous number of miles is you get to
fly first class in flight on time

627
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:10,500
and up in the plane we go and we get
shuffled around

628
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,720
and be last footage

629
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,740
but I have is my journey into LaGuardia

630
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:25,740
last evening

631
00:43:29,069 --> 00:43:35,900
so again the ticket counter did
Annapolis US Airways

632
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:42,900
the grab bag the throw it on there

633
00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:00,170
injury or taking the journey free TSA is
opposed to post USAF but

634
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:07,170
Anchorage

635
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:26,400
and here's TSA and an apple sick n it's
in other hard-working TSA employees

636
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,839
coming here yup yeah no

637
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,538
watch the back their mixtures not a
bomber terrorist for anything I guess

638
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:37,009
yeah that the stock Austria think that's
that's for real time

639
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:43,089
standing there that was the bag being
scanned well as the previous back

640
00:44:43,089 --> 00:44:50,089
being scanned now this is my back scan
them

641
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:58,479
off we go again

642
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,770
this is employment at of the plane
Lafayette for to be over there

643
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:30,770
that's

644
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:47,660
there

645
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:54,660
so it comes off the plane here

646
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:04,420
slowly very slowly this is it three
times normal speed right

647
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,620
so they get it

648
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:14,620
we wind our way through the bowels of
the Korea

649
00:46:18,990 --> 00:46:25,990
and then I actually could claim my back

650
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:40,990
talk about a job that sucks right

651
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,100
yeah

652
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:50,100
you can tell tolley really care about
your backs

653
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:55,829
and there we are at baggage claim 40%
off

654
00:46:55,829 --> 00:46:59,190
and

655
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:04,050
there I am grabbing my bad

656
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:07,460
off we go so

657
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:11,020
so that's back and like I said

658
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,109
at the beginning ever we caught any
truly

659
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:17,819
damming things yet I know they're out
there its maritime

660
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,829
mom I would encourage others to do this

661
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:25,310
either that or cheaper ways of doing it
you can walk around

662
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,599
and find some cheap DVR's look on ebay
confined use one's lot of times

663
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,839
of but I will continue to video

664
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,220
and would people be interested in seeing
me video going forward on my website

665
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:44,160
yes okay alright I will put out of there

666
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,250
of I don't have anything up right now so
once you also put off on but give me a

667
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:49,810
few days it's Alka more

668
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:53,029
dont work again I don't have anything up
at the site down right now

669
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,180
are so just album or down to work and
it'll be a few days of what some this

670
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:58,049
video up there

671
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:01,000
and its flights continue to keep putting
for a job there for you guys take a look

672
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,420
at so I have found an interesting
actually insight into what goes on back

673
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:05,849
there

674
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:09,640
and what the airlines what you say or do
anymore more to the point ESA what their

675
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,310
aren't doing

676
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,160
they are doing some things correctly now
arm it actually started

677
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,560
to ramp up their use a dog's by

678
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,420
and final to look at some more affective
lower-cost

679
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,790
ways are increasing security are the
short-run pilot programs streetlights

680
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:26,869
various airports

681
00:48:26,869 --> 00:48:31,390
arm white I have faith the government
screwed up like they usually do. I'm

682
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,920
police apart programs throughout what
makes our lives more difficult night

683
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,630
more easy

684
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:42,630
so again hope you guys enjoyed it

685
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,609
we have a couple questions be out there
yes

686
00:48:53,609 --> 00:48:57,589
so up my question is you're transporting
a DVR with the camera

687
00:48:57,589 --> 00:49:01,078
rubble wires a battery yup and

688
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,280
have you ever had the bag opened with
their little note in it

689
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,780
never nights yes it gets worse

690
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,010
last time I flew back from a fridge
identical Corey thing of it I decide to

691
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:12,619
buy some

692
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,000
some fishin bring some thanks home and
you keep called so I went to Lowes I

693
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,300
just bought some doubt like high r-value

694
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:21,940
aluminum its latest of wrapped up the
food and now

695
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,500
sealed off put ice packs in there so I
had that

696
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,780
in back film with a buncha wires

697
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,960
much other crap yeah I mean

698
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,849
I don't know how much more bomb like
working you could get I thought for sure

699
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:40,210
the guy was gonna get searched now still
hasn't happened

700
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:47,210
so with question every down yes

701
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,100
now Wii controller for the Wii
controller and have you

702
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,910
have you ever thought about to looking
at UPS devices inside

703
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:02,049
back to see seen everything I have my
fault about that and that's something I

704
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:02,700
wanted you

705
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,680
comical a pitcher campus I would like to
do is to put additional cameras and so I

706
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:09,540
can get coverage in different directions

707
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,720
so I don't get the white spots at my
back end up on the wrong side

708
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,690
of but GPS would be really nice on
assault rifle how to do that arm

709
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,800
because I'm ready to record an
information summer camp broadcast it

710
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,140
right

711
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:26,650
on it it's probably a bad idea on it so
I really need for how to do that and I

712
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,240
have gotten around to put a lot of our
effort into doubt that something I would

713
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:29,890
like to do

714
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,900
so he might has any ideas or suggestions
regarding implementation about let me

715
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,320
know

716
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,490
you have a question you can go over to
one of Mike's there

717
00:50:38,490 --> 00:50:41,430
so the Wii and I would get you the
accelerations as those packs a

718
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:42,210
turnaround

719
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,510
what separates all-rounders in there
well

720
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,860
we might get your ex element is that the
cheapest 1g by that yeah it's good idea

721
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:54,990
next question arm I think that perhaps
an ideal would be

722
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:59,080
a even like a larger project with like a
wiki with other people

723
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,420
doing this because everest single time
that I've flown I've always had

724
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:04,470
something stolen

725
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:09,090
usually cologne in iPod said something
along those lines

726
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,160
and I think GPS or like a LoJack in
laptops

727
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,600
and just sending laptops out watching
where the hell this stuff goes

728
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,240
and with things like a the the built-in
camera

729
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,790
right now in many different

730
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:28,200
laptops I think they could be possible
to actually

731
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,050
take people in hold people accountable
for this shit

732
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,190
because like I'm personally fed up
iPhone

733
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:39,210
probably like you way too much to the
point where

734
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:43,470
right now I'm just like I'm totally fed
up with it and I i

735
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:47,400
think that's it those are really good
ideas perhaps

736
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,500
maybe something like thank him dot or

737
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,590
its initially thought what do you guys
think out there

738
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,870
kweisi %ah

739
00:51:57,870 --> 00:52:01,370
glad so

740
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:04,830
you you say the TSA hasn't actually
opened your bag yet since you put the

741
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,529
camera in it

742
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,600
pregnancy that what do you expect to
happen when they open up the dragon

743
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,210
fight you think you'll ever see your
back again

744
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:14,210
I have no idea of the bag again and you
never get the foot hits

745
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:17,730
yeah he was playing with Portia last
night there was a ground hold for

746
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,260
traffic

747
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,740
already have evening flight so you know
not not a big surprise are right

748
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:25,440
but my backup full of beer ball got put
in positive back

749
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,280
matching talk of out there in like 10
minutes later they announced that the

750
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,050
way I'm thinkin

751
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:33,180
artkraft here we go this is not the
place for this to happen on

752
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:38,060
arm like it was just out know why the
body of a dead at Naples back on

753
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,220
but ITSA hasn't noticed it hasn't worked
out or doesn't care I don't know

754
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:46,660
which it is I suspect it's a combination
of all three up but he is going to be

755
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:49,730
interesting individually it's gonna pull
for RAM search for something it'll be

756
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:50,330
interesting

757
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,049
just wrap up yes just for information
there is a

758
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,810
actually a GPS device which is pretty
cheap something range of hundred dollars

759
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:02,170
its matchbox eyes and it has memory for
three hundred thousand

760
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:06,650
a GPS tracking it's widely configurable
I think the company's call when tech

761
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,480
and it can recall positioning us
something like

762
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,750
fall measurements per second and for 8
hours

763
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:16,780
and it has the internal a

764
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:21,000
batteries so cat it's just of the
Japanese matchbox I so you can hide it

765
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,050
perfect what would you say the company
was when tech when tech

766
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:28,190
yeah okay a look into that thank you
just got

767
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:32,390
I am curious about the choice of nylon
for the suitcase because

768
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:37,770
I've flown enough and my soft side her
luggage always get sliced open

769
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,290
accidentally somehow right and I now

770
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:45,029

wondering

771
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:49,540
I have you physically had any your stuff
damaged

772
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,610
I mean him back to you yes not at all

773
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:57,310
but other luggage other words I have my
house same same experience I've had bags

774
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,630
site sliced open smashed and wheels
broken off

775
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,470
arm I i have a good Travelpro has the
the really good like

776
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:07,790
the love machine aluminum stuff on it be
like broke some without Mike

777
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:11,300
and how the hell did you do that my
scripts and liked work surfing around

778
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,890
broke it arm some votes for Chelsea
luggage but

779
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,589
yeah yes

780
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,590
I just wanna say recently found time and
my

781
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:25,980
I packed a laptop in my carry

782
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:28,990
and my I checked baggage and when I

783
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:33,150
when I got my bag back that I found the
hard drive separate from the laptop

784
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,220
real and I found the polarizing filter
completely wrapped up

785
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,320
there's this like nice little note from
the TSA thing we inspect your back

786
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,000
so I like I call them I'm why was this
messed up it was so padded their sys

787
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,470
would have had to hit with an ice pick
yeah and so they said

788
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:52,860
0 you know file a claim in aid there's a
sort of laughing like is there

789
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,010
nothing to camera that ever satisfied
yeah

790
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,530
not quite as severe as what you our I
had a situation like that what you say

791
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,080
clearly

792
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,779
right SS was the airlines clearly
screwed up my wife gets destroyed some

793
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:05,500
stuff like

794
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,040
on up there was plenty of family what a
trip by TSA all the time

795
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,540
the select weather ample time I didn't
do people know so I don't use it did

796
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,380
this one

797
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,470
but you know if TSA damage that the
plane the airlines airlines do with the

798
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:17,560
quality is a

799
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,779
that's why I wanna see things like
action star popping up on my I might

800
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,430
find a cost-effective way of making it

801
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:29,500
sure last question um like yourself I
travel a lot of business

802
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,430
