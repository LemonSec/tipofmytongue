1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,559
well thanks for everybody did show up

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,590
I i think is a really important topic
coalition lot more people were shown up

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,890
because I i do this presentation
periodically

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:14,970
different groups and i really appreciate
being invited to do it at all

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:19,480
because the right kind of people that to
I'm really addressing her really

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,920
the people that it come to hope on John
Straub so

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,050
just by way of background a

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,789
started out the CIA who's in a
clandestine service

9
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,719
a for anybody that would know the
difference who I was a CT

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,350
and then after that a ahead about
twenty-three years or an engineering

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:41,850
firm

12
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,589
security and Fire Protection Engineering
we design security all over the place

13
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:49,530
including the S&P ready for the World
Trade Center after in ninety-three

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,059
bombing

15
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:54,708
topics I'm going to cover our

16
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:59,329
convergence a community's obviously to
some extent of preaching to the choir

17
00:00:59,329 --> 00:01:02,519
the cost the security which

18
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,679
most people don't know even though they
sometimes think they do

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,410
in urgent need a triage now explain that

20
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,259
summer the new threats problems at
Homeland Security

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,840
and as preaching to the choir and issues
a privacy and civil liberties

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,780
so why security presentation at hacker's
conference while they're lotteries

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,250
one is because security and

24
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,840
CT it. are converging

25
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,360
most people know what's happening but
most people are paying attention what to

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,620
convergence is and what

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,450
the effect is having on both sides
particularly on security I'm here

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,050
because there's something I'm

29
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,158
about security community you should know
you need to know what's happening

30
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,409
you may know a lot less than you think
you do because CT in ninety are driving

31
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:55,640
security today

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,130
sometimes in the leadership position and
need a community security RCTI d

33
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:06,940
is paying attention to because he Tite

34
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,449
people in general including people and
hope

35
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:17,298
know a lot less about security than they
think it is and maybe more importantly

36
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:18,810
because security knows

37
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,769
very little about C Tita had a big part
the security community

38
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:29,670
community doesn't wanna and because
security leadership is

39
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,680
at least faltering possibly fail

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,340
because this community

41
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,849
me has security community needs people
from CT I T

42
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,909
and maybe the needy urgently security
needs

43
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:50,950
new eyes fresh blood and we need smart
people

44
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,959
and that's certainly something that that
hope represents and there's a ton of

45
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,049
smart people here

46
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:03,049
impacted everything that I'm talking
about everything that's changed started

47
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:03,989
with

48
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,689
with 9/11 not so much with bombing the
oklahoma city or for that matter in waco

49
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,620
them

50
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,029
some ways I think waco was far more
tragic but 9/11 changed

51
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:17,370
everything in the united states and
their ripple effect around the world

52
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,989
america is no longer the same after 9/11

53
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:26,629
there was a time after 9/11 when
Homeland Security

54
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:29,730
would hire ended higher anybody that
appalls

55
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:34,519
anybody for example they couldn't get a
job with any other federal law

56
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,909
enforcement agencies could probably get
a job

57
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,849
at first he went to the air marshals
program and help me they wanted

58
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:47,849
you know my security you are all higher
there's something called kaplan's law

59
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,418
this is a Ukrainian floss for that

60
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,019
with a publish a lot in the sixties and
he said

61
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,139
give small boy amor and pretty soon
everything he finds

62
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,650
requires pounding my variation is trucks
law

63
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,169
ask for advice from security people and
soon

64
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:13,689
everything looks like terrorist activity
that's a

65
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:19,599
my friend Osama there in the booth guard
booth and for the country as they don't

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,040
aren't convinced just think I mean my
best example as Cat Stevens

67
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,220
eye-catching musician he unfortunately
from his point of view I guess or

68
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,350
america's point of view

69
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,650
decided to become a Muslim you don't
believe in the Islamic faith

70
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,720
and was put on the no fly list

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,200
as if we headed fear cat Stevens

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,270
can find Osama but we sure found where
he was

73
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,740
Department of Homeland Security was
established in 2002

74
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,530
not long after 9/11 activated really in
january 3

75
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,260
last year I don't know what the current
budget is because with a lot of

76
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,500
controversy but what the numbers are but

77
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,020
forty 4.6 billion dollar budget last
year

78
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,539
280,000 employees and disorder

79
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,930
FEMA Secret Service immigration
naturalization service they have new

80
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,050
names now

81
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,640
customs TSA and Coast Guard

82
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,510
big organization

83
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,620
when DHS was building the thinking was
and still is

84
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,090
anybody with it prior experience in law
enforcement where the military

85
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,270
particularly chiefs of police and
admirals and generals

86
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,780
where security experts and I'm

87
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,480
and the reason you're not is not that
they're not smart people many Americans

88
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,370
mark people

89
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,930
that simply there's nothing in their job
in their employment what to use to do

90
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,240
teaches and anything about security with
you talking about operational security

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,430
with the mindset work certainly not
technical

92
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,230
one of the great advantages if there
isn't an issue coming out at the CIA for

93
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,430
security business is this the only
agency where

94
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,810
that teaches you to be the adversary TBD
attacker

95
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,460
to be the aggressor and the only way you
you deal with security in terms of

96
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,390
solving security problems

97
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,520
as you got to think like the bad guy
because if you can't think like that

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,120
that you know what they might do and you
could do canto

99
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,480
planning well generals and admirals in

100
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,300
judges headed partner Homeland Security
is a judge

101
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,370
with absolutely no security experience
whatsoever

102
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:34,750
now there are some people in Homeland
Security don't not

103
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,360
I don't sweep with a too broad a brush

104
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,800
there are very smart very competent in a
lot about security

105
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,350
but there are only a handful here and
there you're a lot of people know my

106
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,110
security and

107
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,780
other parts as the security organization
that fundamentally have no background

108
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,190
and lie the wacky things particular you
see now you can add you know a second

109
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,969
pic I

110
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,320
TSA a lot today this morning anybody
know what TSA stance for

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,810
nah thousands standing around

112
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,570
so

113
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,580
he have a mindset problem in illustrate
that problem and I'm not pickin and on

114
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,680
them to be

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,480
critical and destructive way I'm pickin
on and be critical in a constructive way

116
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,530
because if we understand the problem he
can sell a problem but if you don't pay

117
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,330
attention

118
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,890
rack there's no problem nothing gets get
set U Haul

119
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,890
of progress occurs to conflict

120
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,039
in LAX simply terminal at DIA TSA
employees had a

121
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,510
Los Angeles airport tripped over power
cord

122
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,810
she was interviewed after which I mean
all the details what happened a very

123
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,139
clear

124
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:49,620
now for reasons I still can't explain
nobody noticed for quite a while

125
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,350
I don't know what a while is that the
have watched the metal detector was

126
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,370
working more

127
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,190
I have I think you'd be pretty obvious
you know because there's a little

128
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,040
lights on their tell you with the
sensitivity is

129
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,840
almost always team to our be able to
pick up five nickel stacked

130
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,210
nichols being non ferrous 5 nichols
that's the sensitivities try for

131
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,980
anyway somebody in a supervisor position
saw that all of a sudden a metal

132
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,970
detector had been working for a while

133
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:23,470
say clean and the entire time made
everybody leave

134
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,130
everybody had come back to security
again huge lines outside

135
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:32,250
was on the local news and hundreds of
people mister flights I mean I don't

136
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:32,650
know

137
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,559
with what the effect on america was
economy people missed meetings and so

138
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,919
forth

139
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,299
with the theory with the thinking that
somehow

140
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,940
a terrorist might have caused this woman
to accidentally tripped on a park or did

141
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,460
pull out power

142
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,260
somehow I don't mind controller I know
what your thinking was

143
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,000
the problem was that

144
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,290
they don't think about

145
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,130
judgment government process not talking
about not just American government

146
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,470
almost

147
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,779
any government world the processes
people are

148
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,660
constructed demanded to follow the rules

149
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,980
here discouraged and sometimes even
punish reply in judgment

150
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,690
and the problem was that the at the LAX
terminal nobody wanted to apply the

151
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,830
judgment of saying

152
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,550
this is ridiculous plug it back in and
just keep on going

153
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,880
it wouldn't do that another example the
mice a problem is a

154
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:31,870
II hero let people tell me all the time
that well you know we got some really

155
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,020
good people and places like I said there
are some really top-notch people in

156
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,910
any organizations to know what you're
doing the fixes

157
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,020
Mike my aunt counted as if anybody here
has ever thought about the airline

158
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,540
airplane toilet is one of the worst
designs

159
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,250
particularly for toilet anywhere on the
planet

160
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,020
an airplane toilet has been like that as
says airplanes work

161
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,130
used to carry people and it still is

162
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,760
and there's no sign a lever change

163
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,680
so that given enough time don't count
the fact that everything will be done

164
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,029
right neck I spent a lot of time on a
convergence cuz most you know with the

165
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,650
convergence is but just the

166
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:17,709
refresh everybody's memory missus that
tiny list compared it with convergence

167
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,950
everything's obviously going to digital
IP network

168
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,560
networking particularly for video is
every in fact when you buy a video

169
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,410
camera today

170
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,250
where the an IP network it or not it's
ready for IP networking

171
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,100
its built-in Stan in fact lotta sense is
now

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,470
r.i.p or at least networkable up
connections

173
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,790
internet in that based service for
examples very common video

174
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,569
resolution is going up and up facial
recognition for example still not ready

175
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,670
for prime time

176
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:51,170
pretty close probably it's really a
degree and a %uh resolution

177
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:55,560
security probably uses fuzzy logic and
analog tape thinking I

178
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,310
of processing signals problem with an
almost any other sector in industry

179
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,230
because a digital analysis of the
situation

180
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,050
dozen help you as much as a fuzzy logic
way that is

181
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,310
you know I if you know certain
conditions the computer can say okay

182
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,760
this is probably a false alarm not tell
you definitively now

183
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,620
but you're basing on probability as soap
with anyway RFID effect by

184
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,150
my brilliant daughters doing a
presentation tonight at to

185
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,410
8 p.m. on RFID fast to finish drops red

186
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:34,699
if anybody wants to sit on on her
presentation

187
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,210
back net-long works long hours in
particular very very important security

188
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:40,720
because if you apply line works that's
basically

189
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,890
really intelligent to multiplexing you
can save wire conduit cost up to forty

190
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,520
percent

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,040
maybe even higher is high 60 percent
sometime nanotechnology and on and on

192
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,240
you know this stuff this is the
convergence

193
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,160
where the Casa security well who notes
to some extent

194
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,199
costs are buried in odd budgets

195
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
the overlap constantly some state and
local %uh

196
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,700
organizations don't report lotta
security costs I'll give you some

197
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,010
examples have sometimes why they don't

198
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,649
no one really knows what security
spending as naquin if your property a

199
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:16,710
commercial property put up a fence

200
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:20,230
as that a security expenditure re or
simply an

201
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,680
and need for you to demarcate illegal
bounty

202
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,480
it's hard to say depends a little bit on
how the fans is used

203
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,430
overseas figures even though I made in
st. a stab at estimating a very hard to

204
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,490
get because you're not share

205
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,970
and then a lotta sectors in a
particularly private security

206
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,230
banking industry for example hides their
security and crime

207
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,430
for no problems offer fear liability

208
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,430
the lawsuits from the 1993 attack

209
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,940
on world trade center with Jess finally
settled

210
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,790
last fall after all these years

211
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,620
in nineteen ninety II published a book
along with the bill Cunningham

212
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,040
I he was probably the first seminal work
on a

213
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,810
understand his size and private security
has law enforcement and private

214
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,690
to see and public-sector and
private-sector security

215
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,080
based on original source data and that
is we went back as much as possible

216
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,260
could always do it

217
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,360
again real data rather than a have
anecdotal information

218
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,740
and reports have other things we need

219
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,370
today a vital requirement to update your
information is we really don't

220
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,450
since 9/11 we have no idea with the size
security or law enforcement is

221
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,470
but based on earlier work

222
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,880
one thing we found out was in nobody
knew that in 1977

223
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,620
core it was a crossover knows private
security suddenly

224
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,800
became more expensive more expenditures
for made private security and public law

225
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
enforcement

226
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,060
know you realize that am but I'm a ended

227
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,649
to the year two thousand private
security was double

228
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,510
the size of public law enforcement until
the book came out

229
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,980
nobody had a clue that was happening

230
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,140
but I was year 2000 911 came along

231
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,250
this is we don't I don't know what
happened for sure

232
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,730
this is what I think happened I think
across the over again

233
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,920
and public spending for security

234
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,029
and now using the broad as term for
security is probably crossed over and

235
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,110
has hired

236
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:33,050
then our private security again and
maybe much much higher

237
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,649
are the Congressional Budget Office made
these estimates I think you're extremely

238
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:37,500
low

239
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,630
and again they're confused position
overlap problem

240
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,520
white house recently a as if I think
last year

241
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,529
estimate the US is spending a hundred
billion dollars a year on home ice

242
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,070
security will I know that can't be true
because our own book our own study we

243
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,959
determine

244
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,350
was a hundred three billion dollars year
2000 so does make sense it's only a

245
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,589
hundred billion dollars today

246
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:05,310
but I think the figure is is this and
this is a conservative estimate

247
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,820
I think it's at least three hundred
million dollars a year billion dollars a

248
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,820
year

249
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:13,140
it could very easily be four hundred
billion dollars or five hundred billion

250
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,600
dollars

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,690
nobody has done and analysis yet up for
those costs

252
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,640
bottom line is right now nobody knows
what the cost is except that it's really

253
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,800
really high right now

254
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,269
any I think these are astounding figures
if you talking about

255
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:36,500
our legacy deplete our kids right now
where rate is spending one trillion

256
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,760
dollars every three point three years

257
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,510
on security if you consider the Global
War on Terrorism

258
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,850
with iraq we're spending a trillion
dollars every two and a half years

259
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:51,350
trillion dollars

260
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,550
and another way of looking at it for
example lead if he'd get within the

261
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,060
macroeconomics look at microeconomics

262
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,190
typical office federal office building
for years and years

263
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,540
cost somewhere between 100 to 200
fifteen dollars a square foot

264
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,279
State Department facilities have been
running and still run they actually ran

265
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,610
higher be brought back now

266
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:16,070
for a fifty dollars a square foot but
the recent US Congress visitor center

267
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:19,279
which took in account 9 11 and all the
post-9/11

268
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,800
security thinking in on protecting all
that

269
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,690
ran up to $950 dollars a square foot

270
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,740
CIA headquarters would have been nine if
it does work for

271
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,180
present is not $950 dollars work

272
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:39,399
we don't have enough money to do
everything that needs to be done

273
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,690
are always big places there and
protected in as the overall leader

274
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,620
a botched said why attack clients when
you're so many she

275
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,740
we have an urgent need to triage

276
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,839
so what is triage well

277
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,010
most people credit haven't having been
not developed as a concept in world war

278
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,750
1

279
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,640
when there weren't enough medical
supplies and have doctors there are

280
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,689
three rules

281
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:09,860
do you do not treat a soldier who will
die even if you treat them

282
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,360
he do not treat a soldier who's gonna
survive even if he's not treated

283
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,760
you only use the medicine in a doctor's
for those soldiers who wouldn't survive

284
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,010
if they want re now it's not at

285
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,329
humane way of doing it but if you think
about it if you don't have enough

286
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,049
medicine

287
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,129
don't have enough doctors and you can
wish it did be otherwise

288
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,700
you gotta do something and there is make
most up what you have available

289
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,920
and helped the most with the least in
amount

290
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,510
reality is no matter what you believe in
triage or not

291
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:48,610
doesn't matter because sooner or later
United States is gonna have to triage

292
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,799
now I will say I've been pitching is so
presentation is speech for a couple

293
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,740
years now

294
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,370
and as far as I know I've never
convinced anybody in with

295
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,140
decision-making authority

296
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,870
about this concept but like I said also

297
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,170
because america's whether they agree
that are not seeing her later

298
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:09,140
you have to do it unfortunately if it's
later it's more difficult

299
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,020
new triage is do not expand security
resource

300
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,879
protect venues that cannot be
effectively protected

301
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,130
now that doesn't mean you don't do
anything I'm not saying

302
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,860
i'm saying is don't spend a lotta
resources don't spend

303
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,059
tens or hundreds of millions of dollars
what's an example a venue that cannot be

304
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:28,740
protected

305
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,760
mass transit

306
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,450
subways buses chains

307
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,880
if you start you know %um what everybody
X-rays metal detectors you gonna kill

308
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,940
the industry

309
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,690
might you know might fun is what go out
get somewhere somebody's

310
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,770
mass transit cannot survive that kinda
scrutiny you gonna have to accept some

311
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,179
risks

312
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,700
do not expand resource protect venues
that can be reasonably survive anyway

313
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,309
what's an example that reservoirs

314
00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,990
we're spending hundreds of millions of
dollars protecting reservoir water

315
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,160
reservoir systems

316
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,679
across american again and repeat I'm not
saying don't do anything and reservoirs

317
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,549
you should meet a minimum security the
reservoirs have the advantage of being

318
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,730
protected by dilution to extinction

319
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,490
there have been at least seven
documented cases criminal

320
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,250
%uh colonels poisoning reservoir systems
project in

321
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,740
new louisiana several times with are
snacking now

322
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,929
all kinds of chemicals to extort money I
the government saying we're gonna put

323
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,020
even more in

324
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,530
he would take tens of truck floats

325
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:42,600
arsenic anyway I before reservoir system
for anybody even notice

326
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,809
and yet was spending hundreds of
millions of dollars taking in factor

327
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,240
your ideas that certain city's largest
cities in America

328
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,740
with the actually wanna put cover on top
at the reservoir

329
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,660
now you could do it like the Superdome
that left fact it is about three times

330
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,179
the size the Superdome

331
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,919
you keep doing but what first following
what's the problem

332
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,280
I mean with that's now we're going to
attack the system anyway I can attack

333
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,700
the system and do it like in New York
City

334
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,120
well just rent an apartment someplace
like democrats village

335
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,360
and output at fifty get five gallon
drums and nasty stuff in the basement

336
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,460
a tap into the city water may not back
part and why because all

337
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,990
older city systems have no backflow
preventers

338
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,120
yet exist when he's water systems were
put in

339
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,559
so all you do is a have have more
pressure than the city pressure

340
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,720
in this stuff will go into the water
main be distributed downstream

341
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,350
you don't have you when I ever attacked
reservoir

342
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,169
do not expend resources get venues are
unlikely to be attacked

343
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,280
I get back to that in a minute that's a
real one as we're spending

344
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,990
hundreds of millions of dollars on that
one only expand resource protect venues

345
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,540
that will not survive

346
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,240
without a and the probability attack is
reasonably high

347
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,830
by the way in but he has questions I
interrupt me anytime it doesn't bother

348
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,379
me

349
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,380
one iota i think is

350
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,200
critical the match to counter measures
to the threat use a scalpel

351
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,240
now to meet acts right now so far since
9/11 we take a meat-axe approach

352
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,780
everything again TSA's probably best
example

353
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,860
I don't know how many millions and
millions a big

354
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:29,169
up propane litres the cops Katie until
they change policy

355
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:34,500
you know why the change policy decide
it's okay

356
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,000
where

357
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,590
no no now I did you get into sinister
now

358
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,049
the reason why is they cannot find
matches

359
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:50,900
you can't find paper matches so he can't
find a paper match

360
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,660
why he worried about the big lie to me
in both a little flames

361
00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:01,480
yes thing is hand and this I don't it's
oversimplify because I am

362
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,360
oversimplifying but I've talked to TSA
people I know dozens and dozens among

363
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,820
you know

364
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,549
very well and I like wanna I you know

365
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:14,150
asked nasa will you ever seen c4 your
life

366
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,470
no now so what's the problem with butane
lighters he said well you know the guy

367
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:21,809
on a plane with a shoe you know he's
going to try like to see for

368
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:26,110
and you have bought plane on vietnam

369
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:30,900
I stake you know me my body just a
claymore mine out mines and pee on a par

370
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,410
and pull out it's like clay dough
play-doh

371
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:38,120
poll that c4l and then we take a

372
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,280
big homecoming roll it up the ball we
put on a grounder

373
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,889
we lighting and it burns with intense
blue flame

374
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:49,970
and we could cook an entire meal on
takes a lot of energy lot exelon energy

375
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,700
for c4 to turn into a real explosive

376
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,980
because if you like sea voyages bronze
doesn't explode

377
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,270
now we would never do that an electrical
storm yes

378
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:04,020
stop a so

379
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,040
so n use a scalpel not a meat-axe

380
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,710
consider probability rather than only
consequences

381
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,130
now get back to that but that's a very
that's probably the biggest

382
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,110
mistake as a nation we're making right
now is we're looking at consequences

383
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,880
ignoring probability

384
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,929
understand life cycle costs are most
people have no idea

385
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:26,990
life cycle cost is what is something
cost

386
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:30,429
over twenty twenty five year period

387
00:23:30,429 --> 00:23:34,030
the cot if you want to build a a big
building

388
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:38,010
you hire an architect in you design a
building any bill that

389
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,559
that's probably three to four percent
the life cycle cost that building over

390
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,340
25 years

391
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,879
yet government six-eighths on at three
to four percent

392
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,309
you know the Arctic to get everything
right get the green go do this and that

393
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:54,418
yep how the building operates

394
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:58,470
how to building works is what determines
the costs

395
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,370
and it's hardly ever paid attention you
doing with security I'm sorry

396
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,850
you're fine for that I don't know fish

397
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:10,360
up you have to do it the same way we
have to look at what the life cycle cost

398
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,929
a security are not the capital outlay
sometimes you have to spend a lot of

399
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:15,590
money in the beginning

400
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,809
to save a huge amount of money away and
we don't do that

401
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:26,470
Parlier and finally common sense which
is a really rare thing these days

402
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,720
I believe in outcomes razor

403
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,330
if you see who prints in the sand you're
probably from a horse and I zebra

404
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,879
if I Nanak in your refrigerator is
probably from a chicken not a peacock

405
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,130
simple as explanations in life and
probably the best

406
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,480
most reliable explanations Hopkins razor

407
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,760
is a very good will

408
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,029
and for the country s mom

409
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:55,330
this is true Associated Press October
last year

410
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,879
hey in New Jersey they want not serve a
gumball machines now for civil I think

411
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:04,460
they're still gumball machines out there
I can't remember seeing one for a long

412
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:05,049
time

413
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:08,350
but for guess there's some places that
they want to get ready

414
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:12,879
changing a pocket pussy mouth how many
other better ways

415
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:17,450
here tears to attack America then the
poison our gumball machines

416
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,499
yeah yet

417
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:24,549
they passed a resolutions I

418
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:27,899
oh yeah my children's a holy cow

419
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,909
I wish you have been same thing with the
set at waco

420
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,110
bomb attacks remain

421
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,009
significant now this is a I love maine
my daughter lives in maine bataya I

422
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:40,549
raved about me and so many

423
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,149
you know 11 for Jamba about so long I
went there for wrote my own

424
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:48,200
their mentioned therapeutic therapy
after vietnam

425
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,700
I just love the state anyway and I'll
have shocked to see susan Collins a

426
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,710
senator from maine

427
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,090
publish a local paper actually at last
year and a security block for a while

428
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,299
if I dropped it for plaque a general
interest

429
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:05,360
have been I wrote a big blog on this one
was that

430
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,360
in her bill she got money

431
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,009
for low places in Maine to get to bomb
squad materials Alice

432
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,909
anti-terrorism crap and a

433
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,100
in at my last point is he going to kill
yourself for God

434
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,070
you gonna do in Fort Kent Maine where
you can do in Manhattan

435
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:29,249
you know concern you only have one life
to give up

436
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:33,450
and how many you know where fort can't
his

437
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:37,749
anybody nor for can is alright one
person it's right on the Canadian border

438
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:43,450
just kept terrible floods here recently
no tears is gonna go to for campaign

439
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,759
tickets at the bottom up it's a huge
waste the money

440
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:50,509
I wouldn't give senator Collins and
nickel for anything in me

441
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:53,779
waypoint exception tears the good to
Portland Airport

442
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:58,149
up before they started 911 and maybe the
Jetport in Portland I

443
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:04,539
had make to security little better but
for prioritization Homeland Security I

444
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,379
mean it's it's

445
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:09,899
its you can read for yourself its its
leach that

446
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:13,710
it makes no sense at all coming to this
day someone might might have my dad is

447
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,639
about a year old

448
00:27:14,639 --> 00:27:17,960
unfortunate started new data it doesn't
make any sense

449
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,639
right now at least there is a year ago

450
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:26,279
they had identified 77,000 targets in
america

451
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,629
in reality

452
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:35,919
I could probably now that list down to
20 if you think about it but yourself

453
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,799
again in issues of the terrorist

454
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,059
KKK gonna die you willing to die for

455
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:44,889
what do you wanna die for you gonna die
for a symbolic target

456
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:48,210
like hittin the new nine in a new world
to reach Center

457
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:51,710
or something not as spectacular Sears
Tower

458
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:55,369
someplace you know we had killed a lot
of people and do something

459
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:00,850
but you know chemical plants and me

460
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:06,100
chlorine is not gonna kill a huge a lot
lot of people will kill people but

461
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,330
not the kind numbers that they're
looking for yes ma'am

462
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:13,740
yeah well I can see

463
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:20,049
yeah

464
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:23,429
yeah Japan yeah does a local home-grown
group

465
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:26,679
it didn't work well

466
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,070
yeah what i'm saying is that no matter
what you try to do it's not gonna do

467
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,740
much good

468
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,059
again I don't say don't do anything

469
00:28:35,059 --> 00:28:39,830
I think the patrolling that NYPD enough
Port Authority police to new york is

470
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:44,168
outstanding and make but the thing is if
they catch a terrorist to prevent a

471
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:47,240
terrorist act a guarantee he'll be
serendipity

472
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,730
now I'm not saying they shouldn't try

473
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,179
issue try they should have these patrols
maybe you'll get lucky

474
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,570
but if they stop it ill be because
they're lucky not because anything is

475
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,269
did specifically is gonna given any kind
a probability

476
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:06,720
are stopping a terrorist attack too many
ways to attack the public transit system

477
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,529
to me locations Tony stations too many
people with backpacks

478
00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:13,669
any idea if his screen everybody

479
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:18,759
you gonna kill the system them

480
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,210
yeah yeah London yeah and Madrid

481
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,960
sort well what i'm saying is then tell
me what they should have done to prevent

482
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,139
it does attacks

483
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:30,330
and that's and attacks won't occur

484
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,139
I'm not saying they wanna tact that
target I'm saying don't spend

485
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,149
hundreds millions dollars that won't do
any good anyway

486
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:40,320
the as in the and my

487
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,230
all yucky go to Mikes I think they're
recording this too if you have a

488
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,779
question just go to my place cuz I think
they're recording

489
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:52,980
so I mumia Colo quicker dow

490
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,980
here again ahead Indiana had 50 percent
more terrorist targets in New York City

491
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,519
twice as many as California and
Hollywood

492
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:08,740
is a potential terrorist target has a
Disneyland

493
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,610
cuz ive Indiana had targets include all
McDonald's petting zoo

494
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:22,500
an Amish Popcorn Factory and as we were
flea market is all verifiable fact that

495
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,360
its it's in an

496
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,780
on my skin inspector general's report I
have a question

497
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,710
I'm sorry %uh is with what efforts have
been done within government to kinda

498
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,860
open up this list

499
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:37,020
the up security concerns and have
citizens help

500
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:41,170
re prioritize yes up I wish had more
current data

501
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:45,750
I don't but I there's has been an outcry
a center chamber for example

502
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,570
a for other reasons could declare I
didn't like the way he handled waco

503
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:53,879
he's not my favorite senator but he's
done a really really good job

504
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,310
of putting a home I security feature too
far

505
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:01,070
particular complain about the fact that
men have in stock in New York for that

506
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,460
matter

507
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,490
it's not getting more money so there is
pressure it has improved

508
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,010
Homeland Security is cutting down at
least I don't think it's the numbers

509
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,350
nearly as high as it is

510
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:15,260
but there's a lot OVA pork-barrel
politics still going on

511
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:18,590
I'm not accusing senator cause I think
which he

512
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:22,990
intended to do was naive in a joint but
she did with good intentions

513
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,000
yeah I don't think in her case is
pork-barrel leader I think she really

514
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,390
believes what she saying

515
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,860
she just happens to be totally wrong
cell

516
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,610
now that's that's an important
distinction because there are some

517
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,750
people out there

518
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,320
that know what's right still do the
wrong thing for pork barrel reasons

519
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,139
just to get money for their their local
constituency like

520
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:51,140
bird out west virginia is probably the
king of that that that stuff he got

521
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,620
federal agencies built in West Virginia

522
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:57,240
it's costing people a fortune now a gas
prices high def commute

523
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,550
yeah but anyways

524
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,389
sent a few months is done a really
really good job and others and it is

525
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:07,940
improving and they are taking the Amish
Popcorn Factory of the list

526
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,800
smokes you know up

527
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,920
I'm OK gonna granite times and I go to
quit but for example please talks in

528
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,350
ohio

529
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,800
Kevlar vests you know that the
bulletproof dogs

530
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,510
Mason County Wash & Bar radios are
incompatible with all the other

531
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,760
frequencies they're using

532
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,860
that by the way still problem BC
government you saw my security might

533
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,860
to tow cars cuz big resources your
income is parking fines

534
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,650
I wanted the new threats on

535
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,690
I just gonna touch and his girl here
again I think I'm preaching to the choir

536
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:44,450
certainly in the latter part of this but
are I'm a big believer I love as one

537
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,450
might favor boxes

538
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,910
written five her years BC Sun 20

539
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,020
you know TN me know yourself you need
not fear the result of a hundred battles

540
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,920
if you know yourself not the enemy

541
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,010
every victory gained you also suffer
defeat if you know neither the enemy No

542
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,850
yourself

543
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:04,670
you will see come in every battle and we
need

544
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,410
to think about the art of war for
developing some kinda concept the

545
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,840
Homeland Security we need to understand
risk

546
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,160
I testified at day

547
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,720
several times cited: on at congress this
particular case is back closing

548
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,560
pennsylvania avenue I was against it

549
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,190
I was testifying to keep dancing and
open %uh

550
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:30,950
Secret Service 1i lost but I was sitting
next to the had a secret service

551
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:34,360
he was explaining to the committee I'll

552
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,390
all things are going to protect the
billing we ran at that moment and AM

553
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:41,890
in progress and yet except to the four
sides and

554
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,730
senator mccain may be present mccain
stopped since

555
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:49,880
I'm East it senses now you not gonna try
tommie for

556
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:54,170
take you to the four sides so you've
reduced my respect fifty percent are you

557
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,920
because that's where he was going

558
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:02,160
now is the same as security is a much
better now

559
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,280
in his billing no it's not at the finish
the job

560
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:09,590
it's like you never did well so who sees
him gun attack

561
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:14,940
those two sides I'll attacked the other
tooth we have to think about and think

562
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:15,700
it would be good

563
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,800
generals in particular chance

564
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,210
plan all everything based in Alaska
great where they can remember

565
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,000
almost all in anti-terrorist counter
terrorist activity today

566
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,639
is based on truck bombs

567
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:35,080
fertilizer bombs and airplanes crash

568
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,170
and yet

569
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,550
standards were used in because the bombs
can be made so large

570
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,490
I don't want to identify for various
reasons but the standard were using for

571
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,430
the sizes bomb we design to

572
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,419
is so small it's insignificant I mean
the Met countermeasures

573
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:58,850
insignificant bombs are too big

574
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,049
cares probably won't next time next 9/11

575
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,130
probably not gonna be explosives are
crashing your plans

576
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,420
you're gonna change your tactics to beat
her countermeasures

577
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,570
a terrorist attack in america cannot be
prevented

578
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:20,650
all we can do is sometimes have some
influence away returns

579
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:27,560
and maybe one but we cannot prevent

580
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,610
I was I will I wrote all the a capers

581
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:36,860
and secrecy anybody out might be a bit
like also that movie

582
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,890
and by the way I

583
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:45,359
is nothing in sneakers if you copy that
will work

584
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,558
but the last in parks who who also did
war games before sneakers

585
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,740
got such he from Silicon Valley for war
games being

586
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,849
a inaccurate terms a technology that the

587
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:00,140
you know the got me to collaborate with
family with its secrets

588
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,879
haw I bring this up because

589
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,529
is the harder some in the new threats
see if this works

590
00:36:08,529 --> 00:36:13,260
world is now run by packmans anymore and
it's your money is from by the 1's and

591
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:13,940
0's

592
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:17,839
it's a beta it's about who controls the
information but see

593
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,839
hiya how we work what we think it's all
about the information I think seekers is

594
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,430
still a great movie

595
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:29,589
you know I just a I about every time I
go out to hollywood

596
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:34,049
I still have friends out there I can
talk about sneakers to prom is everybody

597
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:39,369
up for Phoenix is dead are Robert
Redford's getting pretty darn all

598
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:44,099
itself but cyberterrorism

599
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,670
obviously and again I'm preaching to the
choir son has been a lot I'm here but al

600
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,339
Qaeda is already using the Internet

601
00:36:49,339 --> 00:36:54,019
as a partner transnational operations
tax escape can be

602
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:57,190
devastating because no SCADA system
United States

603
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,410
can only SCADA systems has been
developed wherever design

604
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,960
for a lot of protection everything's
kinda clinched on the back hammered on

605
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,619
the back

606
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:10,480
it's not party original design I'm not
going to be mad at in fact the

607
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,170
presentations on botnets here

608
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,029
up you chair tomorrow that are gonna
cover this I'm not gonna get into it but

609
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:21,920
it's a huge threat potential who's
paying attention

610
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,349
I'll according to a are this quote

611
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:29,160
court all computers Internet may be used
by cybercriminals right now

612
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,049
beyond

613
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:38,910
you know computers and so forth CDI
regions chemical warfare biological

614
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,710
agents rheological agents

615
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,140
it's a serious serious problem there's a
outfit

616
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,460
fiction for example that there's only
two places in the world the smallpox

617
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,109
exist

618
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,170
one is at the CDC in Atlanta and I
designed the security actually for that

619
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:53,630
building

620
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,880
and the other is in Russia in

621
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,170
when well smallpox were regarded as no
longer being a world threat

622
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:08,009
in 1957 58 there was a huge operate a
small box in the Middle East that

623
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:12,619
leaving Iran time and everybody every
doctor every

624
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:16,150
hospital system around the Middle East
went there and got samples on it because

625
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,589
this was a very very one former smallpox

626
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:25,470
resistant to treatment are everybody
keep those samples

627
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,839
in a in was inferred chemical warfare
reasons those

628
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,509
if there was another outbreak needed the
samples they can work on

629
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:36,839
some kind of anybody for low samples
still out there

630
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:41,240
do you want to kill our people with
smallpox all you do is in fact somebody

631
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:45,720
a sentiment in Manhattan them walk
around for a while everybody that touch

632
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,150
every by the brush by

633
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,269
every place they've been they're gonna
get smallpox

634
00:38:50,269 --> 00:38:53,690
the Native American population nice
States

635
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,960
fifty percent of the population was
killed off on when that

636
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,019
Columbus and subsequently people right
in the world

637
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:03,170
mainly from disease including smallpox

638
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:08,190
five best defenses aggressive in vibrant
elsasser

639
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,430
it's the only way you can stop
terrorists is to know their intentions

640
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:18,069
and while technical intelligence is
wonderful and believe is a speaker a

641
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:22,920
Bob Steele yesterday I heard him say he
said four percent I say two percent of

642
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,319
all intelligence is right

643
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:28,069
that's useful comes from technical
intelligence everything else

644
00:39:28,069 --> 00:39:32,700
drive from human intelligence called
humint net is the only way you know what

645
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:33,500
the intentions at

646
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:37,549
out the adversary ours for the adversary
tell you or you're with him

647
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:42,500
year the next crippling attack

648
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,980
maybe in cyberspace a week this defense
is hardening against it you know I'm not

649
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,819
i advocating

650
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,190
don't do anything do everything we
reasonably can

651
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,180
but its the week is possible defense we
have for terrorism

652
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,259
United States probs Homeland Security
well

653
00:39:59,259 --> 00:40:02,880
I'm here I'm gonna be preaching for
choir but I call it the bronte syndrome

654
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,180
that's

655
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:08,808
one big problem most have little or no
prior security experience including the

656
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:09,920
head home I secured

657
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,770
judge as a last few July unless you're
going out on a more current figures 24

658
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:19,819
percent of the executive position so
muscular vacant one reason I'm

659
00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:22,960
like people don't want the job because
the

660
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,230
can do it a look good I yet

661
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,609
no one wants to be browning are the
technical positions which i think are

662
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:33,119
vital

663
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,759
10 percent was still vacant and have the
technical positions they headed that

664
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:41,490
all department is a marine biologist

665
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,730
which is very smart guy what is you know
about terrorism

666
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:50,299
is technology your operations

667
00:40:50,299 --> 00:40:53,410
example this is probably how what would
have

668
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:57,480
lag we have is that if a dirty bomb was
detonated lets a Manhattan

669
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,930
right now today it would take four years

670
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:06,529
for all the people who are possibly
contaminated by the dirty bomb

671
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:12,099
to have lab results come back and tell
them whether they're sicker now

672
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:16,950
in a reason as that thirteen possible
isotopes in a typical dirty bomb

673
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:22,779
right now we can only test for six in
the 13

674
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:27,520
and there's only a handful labs in a
country that can do the testing you know

675
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,720
so dirty bombs it was detonated right
now

676
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,089
in lower Manhattan we couldn't

677
00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:37,770
get a clean bill of health for four
years

678
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:42,759
and that's because there's a lack uptown

679
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:46,289
privacy and civil liberties I'm being on
this

680
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:49,450
and no hope is

681
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:54,710
by the way huh I love Amy's work I'm and
I C

682
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,970
she has most brilliant mind most kinda
will DV is brilliant mind

683
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:03,220
but OK he puts everything in a nutshell
that that bothers you

684
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,180
you know

685
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,899
in the United Kingdom right now and by
the way this information is one week old

686
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,109
so it's very good or 4.2

687
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:19,288
million network TV cameras and

688
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:24,779
one camera for every fourteen people in
the United Kingdom

689
00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:28,180
a Londoner walking around london

690
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,930
on average every day is going camera
three hundred times

691
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:37,960
Manhattan right now has about 4,200

692
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,640
profit prop private and public campus

693
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,670
not all my network way NYPD is probably
gonna had

694
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,920
3,000 by the year 2018

695
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,650
now it doesn't come close to winning
leonard London have done

696
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,989
but it's certainly something the worries

697
00:42:57,989 --> 00:43:02,980
because even though I'm in the security
industry came out CIA I i believe in

698
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,009
what I did I i liked what I get it was a
good thing

699
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:09,430
I don't like the idea of are

700
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:13,058
me if I can catch someone not picking up
the dog poo industry

701
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:16,940
take you to find Ford because our camera
this wonderful

702
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,279
but I don't want them second-guessing
when I'm doing because

703
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:25,220
you got a picture of me coming out at a
bar I'm didn't take a drink maybe it

704
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,920
I mean im he I don't want this to become
1984

705
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,739
which by the way is 24 years ago

706
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:39,660
its is there a he knows what they're
doing with the

707
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:42,788
cameras in London into their people
there XD

708
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:46,059
yeah except the most common question
there is

709
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:50,789
they have a had to have a policy have
not retain it for a long time

710
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:54,150
but when that policy was developed it
was because they could not be tainted a

711
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,329
long time

712
00:43:55,329 --> 00:43:59,390
storage was a real problem and retrieval
was almost impossible

713
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:01,920
I don't need to tell you now that we're
talking about terabytes of storage

714
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,869
easily

715
00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:07,029
done know that you can network you know
storage tanks together

716
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:10,730
retrieval and indexing has gotten better
and right now i i

717
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,569
despite what people are saying they are
keeping it for a long time

718
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:21,069
%ah they in fact apprehended terraces
resolve all these cameras

719
00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:25,410
but keep in mind in in England with all
these 4.2 million cameras in never

720
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,489
prevented terrorist incident from
happening

721
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:33,299
all the value of it came as a result a
post incident investigations which I'm

722
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:34,270
not saying is

723
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:38,470
I'm pointing it is important but it
didn't prevent a terrorist act

724
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,079
and some likely to in a reason as human
being

725
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,900
can't monitor more than nine to twelve
monitors a one-time

726
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,089
and yet and somebody's new centres i've
seen

727
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:54,930
over a hundred monitors on a wall now
granted a lot more event activated

728
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:58,058
and as they queued a the observer

729
00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:02,549
Busta that and of course like I said
earlier facial a professional

730
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:04,589
recognition systems have not worked at
all

731
00:45:04,589 --> 00:45:08,420
I mean every city has put a man has pull
them back out because they just

732
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,430
don't forget of it i'm concerned because
I think the storages

733
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:15,848
is there I don't think you're going to
get get rid of it ice

734
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:19,739
you know as long as they can keep the
images and right now I mean I think one

735
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:25,190
is keen for about a year

736
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:28,640
any other act questions

737
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,230
I just wanna might make comment you're
talking about the movie sneakers

738
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,509
and %uh you mention that nothing in that
movie works yeah

739
00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:38,710
and if using the phone was America Radio

740
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:42,259
you know that there's a Canadian telecom
that when you

741
00:45:42,259 --> 00:45:46,259
log on and decide you want to change how
your being builder whatever

742
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:49,900
they actually use a voice is your
password authentication system

743
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,319
and it is intolerable to the little
attack UK

744
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:56,920
what's different Voice lulls

745
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,460
it you know let me give you a example
though idea because I

746
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,730
when he contacts me to work on sneakers
I said I don't make a training full

747
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,819
don't flow criminals you know

748
00:46:06,819 --> 00:46:10,849
so for example there's one scene when a
up

749
00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:13,869
Robert reference gonna sneak in his
one-room and take some

750
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:18,119
you know take some stuff and he walks
really would really slow you know

751
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,210
well it's never quite clear in a scene
what kinda sense is being

752
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,469
being used there's a presumption might
be passive infrared sensors also

753
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:30,180
which actually seen on screen as a 1/2 a
microwave active microwave sensor

754
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:34,109
they were river phoenix's down in the
basement Green Room heat up

755
00:46:34,109 --> 00:46:37,359
so that the it matches body heat baby

756
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,170
member the movie you know he's talking
to read for know the phone he said okay

757
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:41,940
a

758
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,719
98.6 match patch you know
