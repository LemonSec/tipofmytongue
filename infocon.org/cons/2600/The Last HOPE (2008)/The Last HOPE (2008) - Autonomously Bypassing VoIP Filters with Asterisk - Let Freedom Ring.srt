00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,080
sorry

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,080
sure

3
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,530
I'm

4
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,900
minutes

5
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,019
there

6
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:49,730
you for coming canaveral hearing yes

7
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,629
and everyone here me know now okay

8
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:59,539
a red

9
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:00,500
my name is Blake

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,650
this is Jeremy you thank you and

11
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,820
the talk we're having today is
autonomously bypassing

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,820
avoid filters with asterisk

13
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,630
mmm

14
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,759
as you could tell for the next fifty
five minutes we'll be discussing a few

15
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,979
of these topics right here

16
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:28,649
some in detail some a glazed-over view

17
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:33,409
mom never see the strength

18
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:38,590
yeah remembrances from the room

19
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:45,590
to nap

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,820
will better their time

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,020
so own room good sensually up a process
of 16 word

22
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,730
its her so we're talking about upward
censorship in the past

23
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,280
we're talking about work censorship in
the present

24
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,440
mom and we're gonna be discussing how
the technical revisions that

25
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,500
someone utilizing Astrix can use to
provide

26
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,040
and/or guarantee VoIP services and how
someone in a foreign country or

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,370
on highly secured network can access

28
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,460
an external force server make sense from

29
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:46,460
when

30
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,130
I'm sorry this for bed about go because
the mind there has been a trend

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,440
for foreign governments the sensor
wetzel cheeser

32
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,530
to censor their populace from
information exchanges

33
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,080
some facts are quite obvious the primary
example

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,760
being a dead internet telephone use
anyone know how that feels

35
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,530
good no

36
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,400
up via home

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,300
yeah there have been a scam reports that
over 15 countries in this world

38
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,780
proactively block VoIP I think it's a
shame

39
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,550
mention anyone else think that's a shame

40
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,130
critics

41
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,460
hmm

42
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,300
specifically in China um

43
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,230
is hard to confirm or deny some
information about China

44
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,390
for the pic the primary reason that I've
never set foot in the country

45
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:54,800
so it's hitter mess with what's so the
information get off the internet but

46
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,500
this is what I was able to work

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,450
determine with relative accuracy that
from 2006 to

48
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,800
sometime in 2008 potential even today
china is proactively blocking

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,640
Sep traffic which is a type a voice
signaling

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,180
protocol they've also shown signs over
acquiring some type vetting process for

51
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,260
VoIP providers

52
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,089
which would have to register with their
government

53
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:29,090
to provide VoIP services

54
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,349
a very um interesting

55
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:44,090
aspect to this as far as consumerism and
globalization goes

56
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:49,300
having a policy like this is detrimental
especially for the business traveler

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,610
who goes to China uses their Vonage
phone call

58
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,610
their family and they can't around is
that have

59
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:04,310
I don't happen anyone so never gone to
China and not been able to call the

60
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:04,780
family

61
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,060
no or their friends or have no

62
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,330
they were never been the China like two
people

63
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,780
she can call you

64
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,780
Skype sip Skype sorry

65
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,250
home its

66
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,530
mostly just fire was nice else which is
what we're talking about on

67
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,920
someone quote a couple have a press
releases mom

68
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,330
truth there there been news reports that
there have been dissident groups

69
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,669
with the united states that practically
spam software to people within China so

70
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:49,400
that they could use to bypass

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,890
firewalls and access control lists mmm

72
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,710
the 20 min to be releasing of the site
on having on their

73
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,960
later in the evening on their could be
integrated

74
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,400
the techniques can be integrated into
that's all for so that people can make

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,760
for

76
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,480
Voice phone calls as well as search the
unfiltered Google

77
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,480
mmm

78
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,890
and famous a copy this summer but on the

79
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,400
website though that's on the last slide
Mickelson accesses mom

80
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,470
so Google there in the press recently

81
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,000
for censoring Chinese citizens

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,330
boooooo that's right

83
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,340
mom so online search engine

84
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,860
leader Google Inc has agreed to censor
its results in China

85
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,890
adhering to the country's free speech
restrictions

86
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,630
in return for better access to the
Internet's fastest-growing market

87
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,090
understand why Google agreed to do this
doesn't mean I so agree

88
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,480
with that they did that's just me

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,480
hmm

90
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,470
if you notice January 25th 2006 China

91
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,210
censoring January 27th 2006

92
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,280
China in front of politicians

93
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,850
getting yelled at that's a very good
move

94
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,460
for or governments a not approve

95
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,460
those types of activities

96
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,400
salmon question so phone yes maybe from

97
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,400
hmm

98
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,710
so iight term this very specifically
would you believe

99
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,860
would you believe that Google took an
ethical stance

100
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,159
after getting their asses handed to them
course

101
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,870
once relatively indifferent to
government affairs

102
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,129
who Inc seeking help inside-the-beltway
to fight the rise of web

103
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,509
censorship worldwide of

104
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:13,580
so why am I here and was German here

105
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:19,990
where one what could be done about this

106
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,020
my eyes are two routes

107
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,560
legislation and the reason why I'm here
nursing answer the question

108
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,690
on

109
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:38,229
hmm I ran across a pill presented by
Congressman Chris Smith

110
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,599
from New Jersey nah pills called the
global online freedom act

111
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,500
it may have some loopholes in it but for
the most part

112
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:54,500
the reason why was created I can agree
with the response grin to promote

113
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,459
freedom of expression on the Internet

114
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:00,940
to protect United States businesses from
coercion

115
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,670
to participate in repression by a
four-tier

116
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,180
authoritarian foreign governments and
for other purposes

117
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,899
so this one snippet of the bill I'm

118
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,720
figured you guys would appreciate
mystery the ballparks

119
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,750
the right glove it shall be the policy
of the United States cellular

120
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,570
the right of every individual to freedom
of opinion and expression

121
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:27,620
promote the free flow of information

122
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,680
specifically the Internet and to deter
any US businesses from cooperating

123
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,060
anyone disagree with those

124
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,450
and if so I'd like to hear one no one's
disagree with those points

125
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:48,450
more question please

126
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,430
stop

127
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,839
word

128
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,220
you guys serious who starting a petition

129
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:29,009
No

130
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,259
good and

131
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,880
mmm

132
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,230
know the reason Jozef and

133
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,540
exchange college we'll get into Union

134
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:44,209
if they are blocking said as unknown
protocol

135
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,360
the far-off

136
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,570
simple pagans lead

137
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,690
and specific yes for Browns

138
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,150
if moved as I could get some hope

139
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:09,150
pun intended from mara

140
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,040
key words here on

141
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,839
simple and guarantee and simply
guarantee collectivity

142
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,160
through a few little simple methods

143
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,980
remember in this accident arguments and
how this

144
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,790
seven should be termed by multiple
people but I've put in like this

145
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,230
remember those who have the best tools

146
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,170
whens I'm a firm believer in that

147
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,670
especially you know software tools

148
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,660
arm as I alluded to before Andrew

149
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,420
releasing a perl script that on a basic
level allows a user the ability to

150
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:49,860
determine

151
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,010
if avoid filtering specifically I X is
in effect

152
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,890
they could also help you find a way out
amongst other things

153
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,920
hmm technical overview of basic filters
we'll be discussing

154
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,810
well as far as evading firewalls

155
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:14,140
20 sits on wherefore and access control
lists what's a song

156
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,810
layer 3 so it blocks reports in a box

157
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:22,950
week talk to mom

158
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,950
dues

159
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,710
all rights it verses I ax I'm

160
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,120
the SIP or the Session Initiation
Protocol is an IETF standard

161
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,570
there has you have been ratified in most

162
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,600
VOIP carriers in and solution providers
will support

163
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,300
sit now whereas I axes

164
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,560
9s a proprietary but its proprietary to
Astrix

165
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,770
being that there's only one major
implementation by

166
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,800
X there's a few other ones out there but
is not widely accepted there is an IETF

167
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,590
draft but it expired

168
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,290
so but sip in general uses

169
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,319
you TP or TCP port 5060

170
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,870
and then a bunch ove you TP ports in
there randomly selected

171
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,290
and which is very easy for firewall to
detect you can detect the related

172
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:20,000
connections

173
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,750
and then sit being SMTP like or text
based

174
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,290
you can easily inspect the the known
ports have the known parts have though

175
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,010
header

176
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,420
and usually blocked or just simply don't
open

177
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,720
the necessary pass to get through your
natter to your firewall

178
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,670
whereas I X is a single you TP port

179
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:46,150
for both in an outbound audios they've
multiplex the the audio in the same UT

180
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:46,760
pecan

181
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,850
transport see you don't have to worry
about arm

182
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,000
you know anything being detected and it
can run on neut P poor

183
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,040
normally astor's only listens on you
know you TP poor 4569

184
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,760
Blake shows here in a second there's a
way and you can make

185
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,010
a particular aspects packs listen and
neut people or

186
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:11,530
in case some government or somebody
decides to start blocking you EP port

187
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,380
4569 almost likes how some other
torrents get around the block in by

188
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,470
changing their ports

189
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,420
we have a way here to with using Astrix
to to do that same sort of effect

190
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,610
you will so

191
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,100
you know basically which would ease
which would be easier black you know

192
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:33,300
the love UTPB and a bunch of other ports
or just one

193
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,400
for no excess yeah

194
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,400
seems obvious

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,280
I

196
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:54,100
now in the IX to IX earth the IX

197
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,320
version two is is but there that two
means but

198
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,170
there's a control packet called IX poke
and

199
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,230
it's sort of like an application-layer
paying if you will

200
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,990
we can send a a request to an ass trick
system

201
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,290
and asking for a response or is sort of
like

202
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,969
qualifiers well is the endpoint still
out there you know kind of a

203
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,500
no 2 makes to keep the other than that
traverse a path open

204
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,540
or Justin know if your peers still out
there not

205
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,540
and then now it once a connection is
available

206
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,790
all you really need once you know that
someone's running

207
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,560
I'll and Astrix IX instance are you
really need to authenticate

208
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,300
if there's even other occasions is the
username password so

209
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,910
there may be discreet systems you can
set up that wouldn't even the

210
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,939
authentication if it was like in a in a

211
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,000
semi trusted environment or if you're
just testing

212
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,410
to see if your you IX services are

213
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,969
are ports are blocked you could have a
justice a test box set up somewhere

214
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,610
outside in unknown on fire while the
area Mauricio

215
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,870
to see if you're being locked in a iron

216
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,060
did side year ago

217
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,320
now as we said before

218
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,210
Astrix generally only runs i ax a
protocol on a single

219
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,580
UT people are only listens are binds to
the one you TP

220
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,750
poured storms

221
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,470
pierre Yves will yeah you can specify
Ranger nothing yet

222
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:35,410
yet now the the trick here is

223
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,870
is you can take I using IP tables or
your favor firewall configuration script

224
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,780
spots

225
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,290
yeah Lex boxer or anything you want an

226
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,330
NAT those all those you DP ports

227
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,200
into the UP 4569 ass is listening again
so you can effectively

228
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,410
using the the underlying Unix System
Tools route

229
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:01,370
neut P traffic maybe other than like
port 53 if you want

230
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,619
DNS to work in the box or something but
generally you can afford everything in

231
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,920
the ass text box in the NASCAR x-men
even know there's a big difference

232
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,290
Anna respond just as it was coming out
on 4569

233
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,609
so you can use his or internal tricks is
to the

234
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:19,400
system that ass is Ryanne to give a
little more flexibility

235
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,800
in case they are blocking port 4569 and
now this is

236
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,889
lakes isola script hero I'm going to
show you guys some examples noticed

237
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,750
you'll notice that all the examples or
of the loopback interface

238
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,000
mom in the surgery for legal reasons for

239
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,140
just because I like attacking myself go
figure

240
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:48,420
right so the bases cannot call the IX
being poker i figures

241
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,540
catchy enough it makes sense as comics
explains what it is

242
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,970
so if you execute this command post

243
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,720
loopback interface star poor and poor

244
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,870
actually as a type or should be keeping
my apologies

245
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,920
sure yes it figured out this will scan
the

246
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,530
on 270 is your one from Port want 2024

247
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,520
how useful could that be if you wanna
see if

248
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,980
an IP address is running and shirts on
53 or

249
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,130
ED or any other popular

250
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,500
poor specifically a mom

251
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,130
administrative type ports required

252
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,970
services like DNS specifically so don't
have any questions about this

253
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,990
it's that I X

254
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,270
no poke scam only their arm

255
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,790
unfortunately and there are no other
protocol supported in this

256
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:51,960
on safer tsipras example you could put a
SIP option in there

257
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,510
on and don t is well mom

258
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:02,510
I guess we have time we'll talk about
don't you later no questions

259
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,750
this is an IP range can it understand
cider dressing

260
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,360
I would recommend scanning empire in an
hour one command causes gonna be passing

261
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,510
a reference to written join or miss
array in computers gonna crash

262
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,160
specialist on your PC

263
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,790
couldn't handle it right home didn't
work out too well

264
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,070
so the supreme us can entire germ

265
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,860
non-renewable internet ranged from tyre
subnet

266
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,000
on the 244 245 69 and even combined

267
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,580
and movies with him and persons no

268
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,449
its

269
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:49,740
oh yes but doesn't stop with that does
it

270
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,250
there something and I'm I happened to
notice some

271
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,110
likely for everyone who doesn't have
faster service running

272
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,030
on there is a denial-of-service
potential with the scripts

273
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,510
mom over but the loopback interface
executing this command

274
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,590
will put the script into an infinite
loop

275
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,439
above transmitting you TP packets and
not listening for them

276
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,630
so if I was running this actual test
this with the exact command

277
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:22,310
over the loopback interface and I notice
that the script was taking up roughly 10

278
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,370
percent well asterisk was taking up
roughly 90 percent

279
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:31,760
so on line 29 ratio per cycle seem kinda
interesting to me

280
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:38,760
and make it worse the

281
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,470
the fall logging level does not walk
pokes so if someone is getting dost

282
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,430
by and I X ok packet or a whole lot of
them

283
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:50,700
there's been no locks for no locks

284
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,480
you had something shin Se moving oh I'm

285
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,530
I'm very active member in in the
developer

286
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,070
areas and

287
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,220
I mention it mean way his

288
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,860
is i misses you Russell sewn into

289
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,130
mean hashers running

290
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,820
against it are and an opposition for
this

291
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,460
make

292
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,550
16 masters eventually and

293
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,649
world do away with the thing

294
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:31,100
here I'm known ok then they have no way
to know if you should be

295
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,249
as the protocol well instead of just
being

296
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:38,440
some third-party thing and Westpac

297
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,659
so eventually this effects but as a
great house

298
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:44,740
the Prime Minister's United

299
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,179
is really interested oh well yeah

300
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:54,409
mentioning I it's in

301
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,139
it's in the script I have it there's an
inject functioning you could see how it

302
00:21:58,139 --> 00:21:59,110
lined up the

303
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:06,110
the data

304
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:17,139
yet ACS wasting said call

305
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:20,450
he you know functions

306
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,519
for that lots of and then

307
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,230
you know when you don't the know when
you don't stand collar

308
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,889
whatever it is who owns the resource
cars for

309
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:35,000
yet you doing

310
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,039
more situation or even in more yet
distributed buyer

311
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,389
what we're going to try for flap you

312
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:45,470
use the enzyme easy to the US

313
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,570
the resources

314
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:49,720
fire

315
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,840
his area targeted

316
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,419
box yes hopefully

317
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,470
yeah hopefully of and of bringing

318
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,940
a system down this review but no based
on the simple testing

319
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,320
here is resource utilization

320
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:11,080
day should be you fixin

321
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:18,080
vast says fix today

322
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:26,590
sorry I'm so

323
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,980
he's done sorta indication

324
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,180
not the right word some sort yet

325
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,350
protections in place lead on

326
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,440
requested 0

327
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,260
having some other where

328
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:45,060
ref such as authentication yes that's

329
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:52,060
any more questions

330
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:59,889
you know

331
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:05,619
Rep as well there is an injection
potential

332
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,619
I sent the script up so it could talk
itself if you include the

333
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,739
injects flag and I also didn't give it
the necessary functionality that is

334
00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:17,090
required for

335
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,840
person a to attack victim being on you
guys can add that in yourselves if you

336
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,769
so please

337
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,529
but the functions there for the on

338
00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:31,059
of fake response the forged response

339
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,089
but running I'll

340
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:39,279
running this against myself the script
that I'm activist used

341
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,299
using the scan it will produce false
positives

342
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:48,139
so say the example being you're in China

343
00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:53,759
in your scanning and a network
administrator at a Chinese eyes P

344
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,659
notices that you're looking for a VoIP
server to maybe make good

345
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:03,169
some malicious phone call his phone
calls a really malicious now it is no

346
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,049
on a notice this they could simply
lineup the proper

347
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:10,320
for settings in attack your scripts

348
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,109
give you false positives to say what
this is valid but

349
00:25:14,109 --> 00:25:18,439
really isn't or Union potentially steer
someone at specific direction

350
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,479
through some big social engineering

351
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:25,029
honey yeah

352
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:31,169
or like a honeypot they don't have any
questions about that

353
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:35,849
are

354
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:39,559
you know I i've a preferred the analogy
uva

355
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:42,940
planting the seed us being here is

356
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,330
so we could plant a seed currently

357
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:49,949
unfortunately or fortunately I guess we
could sell

358
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:54,929
we the two are between the two of us
some I haven't been able to

359
00:25:54,929 --> 00:26:00,469
confirm nor deny it that foreign
governments are proactively blocking I A

360
00:26:00,469 --> 00:26:01,109
X

361
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:07,289
right now whether it's a good thing or a
bad thing if

362
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:11,580
I found out on whether that changes in
the future

363
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,599
someone can simply use the script and I
want

364
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,678
me know what a difference figure could
be useful to

365
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,679
to a few

366
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,840
alright before I get the Q&A weekend
cruise through this author took much

367
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,390
longer

368
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:35,710
the New York 55 america's

369
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:40,790
right thumb so-far prescription
telescopic lens other guys think

370
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:47,629
go ideas like my generika OpenOffice
template

371
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,310
it's like them more

372
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,750
any sense information alright rushed

373
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,150
of or nom

374
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,710
the Leslye the open back up has a a
website

375
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:06,930
on luxury talk about the web social web
so I threw together

376
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,720
on work what about so this is the basic
commands

377
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,260
notice I have a hope release version by
the fall

378
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,610
and sends it to the loopback interface
Linda for border 4569

379
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:23,440
hoop there's a move before service there

380
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,450
pretty obvious from mmm

381
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,460
shoe much mmm

382
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,790
then we have a national survey 12 the
poker no no

383
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,970

or was that well

391
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:17,040
you know what on national TV on the
Internet of course that didn't work I'm

392
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:24,040
I do not trust it

393
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:31,039
no offense

394
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,560
word

395
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:40,490
at so the answer knows nor TP data

396
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,860
no ass is now he

397
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,450
it's just wearing it media stream

398
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,210
as on yourself just enough he

399
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,290
by espy's first

400
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,480
replace where ago no

401
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:05,530
layer that which is now tactical as

402
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,540
4i X where is it

403
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:14,540
you desired

404
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,240
in

405
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,610
Marie sumner maternal screen offers an
excuse me

406
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:27,030
k well you're lying near you mom

407
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:30,270
and ask your question German

408
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,280
you want to have an answer what do we do

409
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,200
if someone comes up with a protocol
signature in a plaza to a deep packet

410
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,990
inspection

411
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,140
well we get it random situations to you

412
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,830
yeah I for you get said a since

413
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,240
as so source you can easily set up

414
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,600
a randomization essay in many ways

415
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,290
and random the day no points back

416
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:00,070
each packet affecting me signature
change

417
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,250
each and every packet which would real
hard

418
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,320
yes ramzi but would be open source

419
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:15,320
yet it's difficult

420
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,770
mmm well that's where you the

421
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:30,820
polymorphic the randomize the headers
and thus have shared hasher's on each

422
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,580
and which is pretty much for your little

423
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Sakana

424
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,720
and and when they fixed I just figure
out something else some

425
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,179
rivers got the best tool Windsor star
one-up each other it's comical kids on

426
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:00,440
porque no sour which supply fears

427
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,440
proper announcing not have much luck
with

428
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:16,169
inner

429
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:22,940
yeah

430
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:29,940

quick I wanna

440
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:53,830
attack myself hope you guys enjoy I'm
going to scan my loopback interface from

441
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,830
Port lawn to 1,000

442
