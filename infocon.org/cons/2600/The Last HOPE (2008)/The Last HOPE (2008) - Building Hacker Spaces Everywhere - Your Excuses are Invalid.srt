1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,240
this year I am but you can also build
smaller hackerspace is Nick Farr and

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,470
friends will be discussing the building
hackerspace is everywhere

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,590
your excuses are invalid but we do

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,240
we do have an excuse for running little
bit late I'm sorry about that some other

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,610
discussions have gone over

6
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,470
I'm in the next room at midnight

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,840
on Robert Steele began

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,860
that simulcast downstairs as well and he
goes for four hours so it's not like you

9
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,710
have to leave this thing if you're into
this

10
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,850
so without further ado Nick Farr and
friends

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:40,850
the well thank you very much

12
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,180
this talk is basically the 10 most
common excuses that I've heard

13
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,329
for people not building hacker spaces
throughout the country I've been going

14
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:53,700
to concentrate about hackerspace the
need to build hackerspace is

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,969
I'm first I want to give a round of
applause to the people in the front here

16
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,879
were from hacked the seal built a very
large successful hackerspace in DC in

17
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,660
four months give a huge round of
applause

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:08,770
please thank you to hack DC so

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,209
I also brought some friends appear with
built successful hiker spaces

20
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:15,299
and I'm going to be throwing to them a
freeze the questions just a reminder to

21
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:16,109
our panelists

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:19,298
please keep %uh the story that I'm
asking about 22 minutes

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,700
so we have plenty of time for Q&A
afterwards but I

24
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,490
with any further do with the most common
excuse that I hear

25
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,039
are going to count the specially not a
const this this one goes out to all

26
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,219
those guys

27
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:34,799
in Pennsylvania who can't seem to find
each other

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,529
the rural problem um a lot of you guys
are saying

29
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:41,298
you know I don't live in New York I
don't live in Washington DC I don't live

30
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:42,249
in San Francisco

31
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:45,579
I how can I possibly start a hackerspace
well

32
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,490
one spaces cheap you can get a lot of
really good

33
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:52,639
industrial space for next to nothing

34
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:56,548
compared what you pay for major cities
and I'm gonna throw to my friend 10 from

35
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,499
texarkana who has a hackerspace

36
00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:02,020
in Texarkana Texas 10 be ready to go
here

37
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,079
all right tell us how did you start a
hackerspace in a rural area all

38
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:08,250
ours ours is more of an informal and its
not

39
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,830
as well we're not a non-profit wrinkling
mines Prive ours is privately owned as

40
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,260
theirs is very few others

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,290
in a rural area about some property
about five years ago and it just

42
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:18,650
happened

43
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:23,250
Havelock nice still shop warehouse
building in the back so I used to work

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,380
on tractors in

45
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,130
so we use the and all the advantages as
well advantages over rural areas you can

46
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,730
buy

47
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,790
real estate really cheap buying by an
acre of land with the shop for five

48
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,929
thousand dollars a little better than
renting

49
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,100
look at a downtown space 45 large square
foot

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,440
in a downtown area for for a month US

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,570
that's pretty ridiculous you know well
what are you selling your overall get a

52
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,829
few more people together

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:54,340
before that but that so

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,450
some other the low cost and well really
we gotta

55
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,990
an army surplus I'll military base they
sell a surplus so if you look on our

56
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,820
website

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,060
take a tech out or getting some other
pictures you'll see a lot of

58
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,140
surplus equipment and but while the bad
things about a rural areas like air by

59
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,680
says it's hard to find other people that
you trust

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,950
but just got a bill open what we'll do
we'll have all parties

61
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,150
at a party course free booze and rings
brooches

62
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,750
take donations well at about fifty or
sixty people

63
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,790
but I love that about five or six will
want to come out to meetings on Sunday

64
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,109
in you know do something and that's real
about it now

65
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,280
what one thing I think you've got to
mention you can

66
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,360
below stuff up all the way out in the
country

67
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,520
yeah past RAF lol

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,280
I want all you guys on pennsylvania

70
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,350
I want to go to a grand opening akers
base with a blow stuff

71
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,150
up you can only do that the country so
quit making excuses this is invalid

72
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,050
texarkana proves

73
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,520
we're not scared to a take ours we have
four acres in about will take cars out

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,930
crash together brought him into trees
we've built can and you just gotta look

75
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,069
into your local laws on the cannons and
what boys

76
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:13,050
also alright getting your second the
second most common excuse I hear

77
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,689
I live in a big city good spaces are
really expensive well

78
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,189
in a big city you have access to a lot
more people that are already meeting in

79
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:21,329
tech group

80
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,090
that are already doing things with logs
local things like that

81
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,550
um you guys all meet each other icons
and every single count I go to there's

82
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,110
three people from the same city you come
up to me who don't know each other

83
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,159
get out there just go to different
techniques reach outside the group we

84
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,069
didn't know

85
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,749
pack TC got really big primarily to the
dork but the c-list

86
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:44,819
which was cross posted to the burners
list and

87
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:48,379
the funny part about it is package has
been open for four months

88
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:51,960
up are 41 members four months ago

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,818
I knew three of them that's that's what
the power

90
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:59,620
being an urban areas and I just wanted
also congratulate hack to run I'll give

91
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,460
them the credit because they signed a
lease

92
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,818
akaka love weeks before ok

93
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,479
this only tell us how you solve this
problem well so we could look to it um

94
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,498
wanna thank those who says you know the
right place will come along for the

95
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:14,289
right place

96
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:17,990
the right price we happen to get really
lucky and it was the first place we

97
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,999
looked at

98
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:23,309
so forties have to starting to look we
headed he hits

99
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:27,279
who are paying any were paying Lake
three times with you saying for third

100
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,240
like less than a third of the space and
it's right downtown

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,279
in assertive like slightly sketchy
neighborhood but

102
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,800
and that's really the key is like look
for the right place in the rate

103
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,889
neighborhood and you'll find a place you
can afford

104
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,050
um look further out on transit

105
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,259
if you in a bigger city you're gonna
have hopefully decent transit unless

106
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,479
you're Ottawa

107
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:53,469
I you is somebody for moderator

108
00:05:53,469 --> 00:05:56,469
yet they only have buses um

109
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,550
go go further ahead on transit you'll
find somewhere cheaper I'm

110
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,860
look in neighborhoods that might be

111
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:06,159
a little bit more colorful than you
might wanna live in

112
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:09,080
but that will be totally fine for
running a hackerspace because they'll be

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:09,849
scared if you're

114
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:16,849
like sharks with lasers so all right
thank you leave problem number three

115
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,529
the people problem a lot another a lot
of people say well I don't really know

116
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:23,620
anybody who wants to start a hackerspace

117
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,779
in my area get out there are tons of
meetings Linux user group Steph kongers

118
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,379
2600 meetings

119
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:32,080
people are meeting and talking about
tech they're talking about Arthur

120
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,818
talking about technology the talking
about making

121
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,180
I mean how many make meet up groups have
just sprouted in the past 23 years

122
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,610
towns and cities these are the kind of
people that you want involved in your

123
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,849
hackerspace

124
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:47,729
unsubscribe honestly it's really easy to
your people your house subscribe to all

125
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,159
their mailing list start posting on say

126
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,949
hey I think you know I live in this city
we should start a hackerspace year and

127
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:55,360
eventually people.com

128
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,039
that so hack DC got started and I want
to keep this one to my friend

129
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,550
aircrew show from actually cago they
don't have a space just yet but trust me

130
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,150
in a month they will have one

131
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,610
Eric Harry fighting people in Chicago
hair on

132
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,699
I as on the original board members about
ac dc

133
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,779
I urgent I was going to act going to DC
and I want a certain space there but

134
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:18,150
Thailand Chicago and I knew absolutely
no in there

135
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,439
and that's the question for everyone's
like why no nobody

136
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,889
I mean who do I me go to the meetings
2200 dork by

137
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:28,479
I mean there's so sickness Chicago which
they're burning Man

138
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,979
local group there's basically for the
party thousands of people show up and

139
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:32,818
the base the bring

140
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,969
sculpture are something else you just
embedded systems or something else

141
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:40,580
so you have a whole cross-section of
time different people

142
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,258
hours Assamese within a month I meant
over about a hundred people that work

143
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,039
think I have money I one first down I
wanna do something Eric

144
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,460
how long ago did you move to Chicago

154
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,900
I don't like socializing in it it's
harder first you don't like rejection

155
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,320

want any proof

162
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,380
wire of you right now is because I've
hackerspace is because you'll

163
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,120
said I wanna do something let's build
together got the idea

164
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,300
at the mine down got space projects
that's we're doing right now to Chicago

165
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,090
we start up is the wishes are looking

171
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,730
I i thank you if y'all had very valid

if you say if you post out all these
lists work we're meeting about

175
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,680
hackerspace gonna go taxes here we're
meeting on Tuesday

176
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,670
set goals accomplish those goals and
just meet on Tuesday

177
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,550
of course not everybody is going to be
able to make it every Tuesday but you

178
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,890
know

179
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,890
that every point exactly everybody knows
in the meeting is

180
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,530
4 by the way I have two ads

181
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,220
because we have talking about dork
Barton torque what is a really really

182
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,150
really cool thing and a good place to
meet people the guy who actually

183
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,170
invented or start a dork but is in the
audience I think you should get a big

184
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:53,740
applause

185
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:00,740
given his reply smack %ah

186
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,640
the politics problem

187
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,980
of course this is the hacker seen there
is naturally drama

188
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,310
um the germans actually had a very
simple solution for this he was doing

189
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,260
is right avoid bike shed problems and
force

190
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:21,380
there she thank you okay she or he who
does is right thank you elie my fiance

191
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,270
Hill see watch I

192
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,980
the point is

193
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,810
fine people who do there in the scene
there two kinds of people there's people

194
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,210
talking people who do

195
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,400
give authority to people who do let them
do things

196
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
even if they don't do it exactly the
right way if they get it done

197
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,040
they are right a and just

198
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,120
and endless political conversations
bring them to a close

199
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,690
resolve issues I want to give I wanted
the I give this one to match

200
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,650
to explain how he solved the problem
regarding membership in working out the

201
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,590
bylaws for Noisebridge the hackerspace
in San Francisco

202
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,120
which could you tell that story real
quick now um

203
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,980
that was so one of the things we work
with try to work with consensus process

204
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,750
so

205
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,120
I fine with groups that I've been in
skis my voice I've been yelling for the

206
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,990
last day and a half

207
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:16,750
um a consensus process brings people in
so everyone feels involved

208
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,190
it can feel a little frustrating at
times um

209
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:23,810
because it moves coming slowly or it
seems like it's moving slowly

210
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,720
oh you can go through really difficult
problems and everyone feels like they

211
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,990
can live with that afterwards

212
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,950
um the thing that's been taking us along
this is a come up with our bylaws

213
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,980
in California as with many other states
there's a legal

214
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,490
definition for member and we call that
member with a capital M

215
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:46,000
we want to be a membership organization
that would be not necessarily a legally

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,780
identified a member by the City Calif

217
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:55,230
I'm so we're trying to figure out or
should we conform to california law

218
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,830
with a arm little and members and began
members

219
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,930
a or not well it turns out that if you
don't have legally

220
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,830
to find members in the city California
you can't get rid of aboard

221
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,700
or a board member that job is maybe

222
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,880
overstepping their power or just isn't
doing their job it takes aboard

223
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,189
a vote the board to do it so going now
with out

224
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,730
capital and members we run the risk of
having a board that kinda a

225
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,650
gets out of touch with membership if we
don't have

226
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:34,310
farm a a capital M are we have a capital
and members

227
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,530
other a lot of people who are concerned
that clicks would form

228
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:42,870
and if click forms then they could just
be seen as the cliff gets a majority and

229
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,330
can

230
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,830
bulldoze their way around then they get
rid of a board member that's just like

231
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,610
the scapegoat the juror

232
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,890
and there been a lot of people in now
left the organization's

233
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,510
um who have told horror stories about
that so either way

234
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,580
others there's upsides and downsides

235
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,140
so we just went around and around four
actually a few weeks talking about this

236
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,270
as the major topic

237
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,400
and after a while everyone who has
strong opinions one or the other had

238
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,210
voice them

239
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,270
and a everyone felt we could live with
having

240
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,560
capital and members and there was a lot
of discussion with

241
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,660
some hacker groups around the world
actually using

242
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,350
email and IRC which him

243
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,260
helped us get to that decision that we
could do it locally

244
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,470
with our consensus process and we all
feel um

245
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,550
II if I can speak for the group a we all
feel really good about that

246
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:38,780
and we're about to incorporate as a
legal non-profit tax-exempt

247
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,100
organization in the state of California
which means we can get a bank account

248
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,339
which means we can rent a space

249
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:50,490
so

250
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,720
also given the huge round of applause
for the microcontroller works out that

251
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,870
he's been doing in the hackerspace
village bringing

252
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:01,630
Hans you

253
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,760
good steak thank you so much for that
that is awesome congratulations again to

254
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,439
Noisebridge

255
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,400
and moving on the time problem allotted
okay maybe have the money maybe other

256
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,710
people but nobody seems to have the time

257
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,820
fought once you have a group of people

258
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,900
spread the workout don't let any one
person take on too much responsibility

259
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,450
even if it's a small amount of time you
can contribute use that time to find

260
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,890
other people who have the time

261
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:29,360
college students especially they might
not have the money but they have

262
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,970
nothing but time in a lot of ways and
some colleges might disagree with me but

263
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,290
a and are honestly you don't have to
have the space to start running some

264
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,730
events and getting people involved in
making it

265
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,740
making building a hackerspace a time
priority

266
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,210
I wanted through this one to Jens o look
from the c4

267
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,770
in clone he's started that hackers is
now perhaps he doesn't have that much

268
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,890
time to do it begins please tell us how
did

269
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,260
you guys all the time problem lovely at

270
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,750
a very good so results with the

271
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,760
something that so yes someone

272
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,490
came up with I am presenting a challenge
for for younger people

273
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,180
we repeat this a.m. about once a year

274
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,340
why we have a an interesting problem

275
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,530
for younger people yet actually I am
popular steps

276
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,640
we're going to do that over the cause of
a month

277
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,710
so on suan it gets

278
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,330
in all the newsletters we try to
published at two schools and cologne

279
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,180
this while but that

280
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:32,560
didn't work out so well on anyway

281
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,750
it is a challenge that's a is

282
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,030
especially to younger people under the
age of 23

283
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,310
on this year we're doing something with

284
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:46,510
microcontrollers I before that

285
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,880
there were all sorts of problems like
designing a chat protocol that what the

286
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,600
time it over ICMP so that's
administrators at your school couldn't

287
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,110
REITs

288
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,040
budget setting about so couldn't see
that setting on

289
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,209
and the idea is just to half

290
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,890
young people at the space have them work
on a project that is so

291
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,300
maybe a bit too hot for them to solve
alone so they would learn

292
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,880
teamwork and arm of that that's they

293
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,350
yeah most of the people who just want to
polls or just want to talk big day

294
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,360
dropouts

295
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,390
and you are left with the highly
motivated

296
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,850
young people that you can after that
hand over the space to

297
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:34,070
a to run it excellent moving right along

298
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,080
the money problem this one

299
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,340
I oddly enough I hear it less often than
the time problem you know we can't what

300
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,650
you know how it hurts first two

301
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,370
do this probably like do exactly what
which we have anyone from NYC resistor

302
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,160
on the panel

303
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,540
a what's

304
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,110
actually no rose is a rose get up here
great give a round of applause for

305
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:56,770
pinch-hitting

306
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,030
because I i Goodell

307
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,220
over there

308
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,670
so what would you like to say about
money well

309
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,750
a cupcake um just a couple points on it
here start

310
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,950
small um NYC resistor

311
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:19,630
New York probably the most expensive
place to start a hackerspace

312
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,900
they did it by starting small and
getting people to throw money down

313
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,100
once people started throwing money down
with nothing more than a dream to try to

314
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,930
build the one-day choir hackerspace

315
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,740
that made it real that make people
engaged and involved in a short amount

316
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,410
of time

317
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,710
they went out and they built a very
successful hackerspace in Brooklyn

318
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,840
the other important thing about money is
staying independent

319
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,659
it's great that people donate stuff it's
great that you have donors and friends

320
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,900
and people are donating contribute
contributing to you on

321
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,270
monthly basis or giving huge one-time
donations

322
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,510
but make sure that your rent your
insurance

323
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:58,140
your utilities are covered by member
dues are covered somehow by the people

324
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,870
are directly involved the organization

325
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,600
because one day all that funding may dry
up for one reason or another but if you

326
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,860
have that continual

327
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,460
basis provided by the members the people
actively participating the hackerspace

328
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,770
is you're not going to lose it no matter
what happens

329
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,290
I N you know NYC resistor they start
small their

330
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,190
operating in a very expensive
environment sorrows could you talk

331
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,610
quickly a little bit about

332
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,490
you know how in with your sister got
started how they got their space going

333
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,000
and how they had to

334
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,750
increase our dues lately to cover their
expenses and Stan dependent

335
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,380
something we've already heard parts of
this before I but

336
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,420
NYC resistor started with nine people
who each

337
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,560
put up a thousand dollars I'll down was
so that we'd have enough money to cover

338
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,370
about three months operating expenses

339
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,640
%uh obviously that was um for some those
people that was

340
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,890
a bigger amount of money than for others
but as nick pointed out

341
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,050
putting up that amount of money than
really made us

342
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,270
the really invested in making sure that
the space worked

343
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,550
um our dues per month just got up

344
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,760
to seventy-five dollars a month that
isn't because

345
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,250
you know anything terrible has happened
but partly because we want to make sure

346
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,080
that we're keeping that three months

347
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,939
rent and operating expenses as a cushion
at all times

348
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,370
so that nothing Terribles gonna happen
under

349
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,710
let us risk the space that we worked so
hard to build

350
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,140
um another thing I can say about money
is that we make sure your

351
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,650
that decisions about money are made as a
group

352
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:32,230
%uh you know that was talking about
consensus and that's very important for

353
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,890
us

354
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,430
arm and when something has come up
recently buying

355
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,280
laser I which was something it's very
expensive

356
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,950
huge capital expense we decided that
that would be funded

357
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,870
I by the people who were most excited
about having a laser

358
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,450
answer that wasn't something that was
coming out of our monthly dues

359
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,650
but some think that people contributed
to specifically

360
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,370
I because they wanted a laser in space
and

361
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,310
the details on how we work that out you
can ask us later

362
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,260
I but that was something where we
separated out a huge capital expense

363
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,650
and we're gonna make it happen but it
isn't part of our

364
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,180
inner monthly expenditures

365
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,890
exactly the other thing is fight you
know a lot of people complain about time

366
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,680
people would not allow time have a lot
of money

367
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,330
find those people make the members we
have a lot of silent numbers in fact is

368
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,899
in the wonderful also rose

369
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,150
I want to ask you do you know the NYC
resistor theme song

370
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:34,160
can you sing it

371
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,690
the the theme song that that the debris
had II will try to do it if you can't

372
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,730
but I really would like you to do if you
can teach

373
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,610
try with you apparently I'm not part of
the inner circle that knows that things

374
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,320
are you

375
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,129
know it's up I'm not even a member of
NYC resistor I know it

376
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,510
I don't know what favors you offered him
but you're gonna have to do it for me

377
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,840
but

378
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,689
you honest you know it I only know it's

379
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,910
the just a trim laser yeah its

380
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,660
10 these are we wanna losers on but go
to its

381
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,440
it if I remember america with the zoo

382
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,650
%ah

383
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,160
if I remember correctly it's it was a
teaser

384
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,390
NYC resistor we voted laser

385
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,310
but quite literally ok

386
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,840
normality the whole song runway there's

387
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,129
but but yeah

388
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,170
I'm not gonna from I'd like to stay in a
laser

389
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,390
okay the seven the seventh does come
from what I hear

390
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,550
you know I don't have any furniture
tools or equipment

391
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:48,040
I don't know how to answer whatever you
want here

392
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,690
I just know how to answer whatever you
want their the

393
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,390
okay are you guys took that not a member
laser way

394
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:00,810
pick up but but the point the matter is
if you

395
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,770
have a space if you actually lease some
place

396
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,700
for people to gather and do cool things
you'll get a lot of stuff

397
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,160
someone hacked the sea started we had
our first big event was a parts party

398
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:16,470
we send our and invitation to everybody
in all the different %uh communities

399
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,300
that we knew about DC to say hey

400
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,210
we parts we need equipment we need stuff

401
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,850
this is out bring it on this Sunday ever
done this Sunday

402
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,800
and we got tons and tons and tons of
stuff

403
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,310
more stuff and when you to do that over
the next couple weeks we acquired

404
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,679
a lot more stuff I'm just stick to

405
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,340
quick review this if you have a space
you'll probably have to throw out some

406
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,580
of that stuff

407
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,470
or try to sell it on sale and it will
make somebody

408
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,590
I'm but once but what but once you
actually have a space and people are

409
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,909
involved in the know about it

410
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,330
they will contribute to you I'm far from
the hackers gonna talk a little bit more

411
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,780
about this and

412
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,590
about you know just it once you build it
they will come you will get enough stuff

413
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,669
they're only a few things you might need
to

414
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:05,070
get enough good arts of Philadelphia's
like your cities are

415
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,929
alder ugly sister arm really cool really
nice but doesn't get all the flash innis

416
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:15,130
on so yet we you know we're short on
space world

417
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,920
work is miss lee are on relic by a a
non-profit computer recycling group

418
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,370
and it was just a case so just start
things rolling

419
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,600
home you know we didn't have expertise
there there was a whole lot which is

420
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,860
just three guys

421
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,060
who sat around it said let's get
something going and you know we just sat

422
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,710
down and started

423
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,190
and a lot of times we go to class on
your side their own pocket

424
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:38,300
and the order for a circuit so now we
have four circuits around so it's only

425
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,870
says

426
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:41,490
hey I want to do this they don't have to
wait a week for par you know it's it's

427
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,610
right there

428
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,980
arm just it's just little things that
add up and

429
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,310
frankly it comes under the only thing if
you're really short. is imagination

430
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,760
if you want to do something and there's
a problem and you can figure out you're

431
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,620
looking at the wrong angle or units
meals

432
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,110
opinion because any problem you're into
you can get around somehow you can

433
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,290
pull somebody else in for a different
community you can borrow piece of

434
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,000
equipment

435
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,380
you can pool in with your friends by it
you know the only thing you ever really

436
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,120
short on is

437
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,730
you know enough creativity and enough
drive to route around

438
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,790
situation awesome thank you

439
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,930
the next problem reaching out to people

440
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,720
um a lot of people get really possessive
about their stuff

441
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,640
people for for some reason people arts
to

442
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,840
terribly trusting a lot you know people
come up actually is like yeah I've got

443
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,500
all the stuff I've got enough stuff to
her tax base to my three friends but

444
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,600
I don't wanna share with people like the
they might 3 cuter

445
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,140
do something to order or whatever it's a
this is a completely invalid excuse like

446
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,660
I said

447
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,830
more far away 81st ninety percent the
people that are involved

448
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,110
ac dc I just met for months ago or
sooner than that

449
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,590
we're all sharing our stuff there we all
have it and because we're all

450
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:58,139
equally contributing were all watching
out for each other stuff

451
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,180
if you start a membership organization
people are throwing down real money to

452
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,200
support it

453
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,100
they will watch out for it I just a
quick example we have

454
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,610
a up a refrigerator that spilled the
soda Gatorade bottle water things like

455
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,540
that

456
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,050
and then when I first proposed to
everybody in the group saying I will

457
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,060
just put a little cup for money in there

458
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:20,690
and when you take a sort out put some
money in and

459
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,870
you know that's how we'll pay for and
reimburses said at one I first propose

460
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,740
that everybody looked at me

461
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,800
like I was insane they said what you're
gonna trust people like people are gonna

462
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,530
put

463
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,430
money and what if and honestly we always
run in overage

464
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,450
you know we have not had a problem with
that there we actually use the money

465
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,780
that's generated from that

466
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,260
to pay for Pete's honor Tuesday meetings
and things like that its its

467
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,460
if you give if you show people trust

468
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,550
they will exit they will take it and
they will act like trustworthy

469
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,050
responsible people

470
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:53,240
jens has some experience with this um

471
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,410
displayed on because I didn't wanna
because again I don't have my

472
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,190
panels from NYC resistor here but if you
to show people trust

473
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:03,730
they will take care the hackerspace they
will take your the tools and they won't

474
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,020
break it

475
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,950
I agree I

476
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:14,640
of while one thing that's

477
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,830
we have to on and apparently

478
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,929
thats ass also been used in

479
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,510
act DC was so we

480
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,530
on we use and

481
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,720
we get a lot of upsets from from selling
drinks

482
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,910
at the hackerspace on yeah

483
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:37,110
a apparently a lot of the american
visitors

484
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,470
hat were surprise that the fact that's

485
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,140
in order to buy that brings you would
just have to throw in

486
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:49,490
the money and the fridge and then it
worked like that

487
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:53,040
that's that's a small way to trusts and

488
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,909
apparently it it works out him the other
thing that we do attack TC is all over

489
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,820
public tools and equipment like that
there's a standing rule that if you

490
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,070
don't know how to use it

491
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,460
ask somebody how to use it people know
how to use all there's

492
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,230
at least one or two members not to use
every single to that we have attacked

493
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:08,820
the sea

494
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:11,730
and those one or two members have a
responsibility to show all the other

495
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,490
members

496
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,400
how to use that responsibly that that
kind of thing really works

497
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,550
um mentorship in teaching people in
showing people

498
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,790
how to do things building knowledge in
them filling in gaps

499
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,070
in other people's knowledge is that one
of the biggest reasons that hackerspace

500
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,700
should exist

501
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,190
but moving right along we're doing

502
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:37,450
really well what's I have to talk about
the problem of course

503
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,170
again another problem not just straight
up perhaps the first one is more

504
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,380
stupidity but the second one was just

505
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,550
straight-out thefts you know a lot of
people

506
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:49,389
it's an office as about their tools or
possess about the space they possess

507
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,210
about their membership requirements

508
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,550
a lot of people come up to me and say I
can't just let

509
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,590
anybody become a member you know I I
have to this

510
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:02,310
carefully screen people make sure
they're not free X you know how can I

511
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,490
trust anybody you know we're we have to
have exclusive membership because

512
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,530
you know what if you know people that
they don't know again most the people

513
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,840
involved have to see I met

514
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,610
lesson for months ago and the metal out
in Austin

515
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,660
he's actually prepared for this one has
experience that they have over 100

516
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,620
members

517
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:22,940
yeah I guess the me to let this probably
a like

518
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,050
population wise like maybe the biggest
tax base

519
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,379
on the planet and I mean of course we
have problems

520
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,720
a you have problems to you live in a
freeze country

521
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,780
and we have for a

522
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,399
some problems with South freedom s2

523
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,510
okay %uh the problem is

524
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,530
I have to go back a little bit in
history because a the heck space is the

525
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,870
first text basis

526
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,410
up where a

527
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,970
in you're up that german-speaking
countries and in the

528
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,510
a in the dutch-speaking country and

529
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:05,970
it was Hirth

530
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,990
oh yeah of course of course your okay
you're all

531
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:13,760
sad to see I

532
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,960
good so okay so

533
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,940
up the European hacker movements head
shares

534
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,500
a similar time spent with many many
alternative projects

535
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:29,440
a and there's a clear a connection
between for example the squatting seen

536
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,240
in Europe and the heck I see that maybe
astounding

537
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,240
here in the States but there is a common

538
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,350
bases about that many many heck spaces
in many many hackers are actually of

539
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,400
like they have a leftist backgrounds so
especially

540
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,160
in a pre open field as heck a DOM

541
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,580
you %uh of course face problems and
sometimes

542
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,750
you just have to find out how to kick
people out

543
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,060
okay or if you should kick people out

544
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,850
in the me to let %uh we are pretty much
a mixture between

545
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,250
hex peace and a club or youth club
called

546
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,610
we have at least like would see 200
members

547
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:12,840
100 of those members page okay so we
have people come to our space

548
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,120
who are actually not you member states
just show up

549
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,280
sometimes and we call the problem

550
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,460
the hippie problem a peep so how do we
deal with

551
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,300
the hippie problem what happens if the
guy just

552
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,160
only shows up because he wants to smoke
weeds or up

553
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:37,420
whatever else okay so part

554
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,440
yeah of course yeah you smoke the weed
and you play any time

555
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:46,270
though and you really bad playing the 10
when you're on wheat

556
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,520
so %uh I have to tell you we don't have

557
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,150
a problem for that a problem solving
like

558
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,160
thing it's a highly social problem and I
think up

559
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,230
what spec their

560
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,400
it

561
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:10,280
Apple the occultists I

562
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,760
um would work okay so I mean

563
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,250
I only can say that if you

564
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,200
want to create the heck space it depends
really depends on

565
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,300
how big it is how many people are there
and what is your

566
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:28,190
special-purpose I mean to hit the meat
11 Vienna is make sure between a youth

567
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,660
club

568
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,680
and a heck space so we have

569
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,220
different problem stand for example and
my series sister I mean if

570
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,270
around 200 people are even more coming
to our space and miss you sister

571
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,720
20 members and their hand-picked days
sick

572
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,970
complete this there's a whole world
between of course

573
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,390
we do cool stuff at me to let and is
cool stuff happening

574
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,580
at NYC resistor became mentioned a
completely different problems concerning

575
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,120
trusts a in both plots at

576
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,400
by of if if you

577
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,880
the kids all her

578
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,850
you the you

579
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,820
except maybe ass yep

580
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:16,050
so %uh

581
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,000
let this be a future let this be future
lessons you never let your last speaker

582
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,590
be a performance artist

583
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:25,210
hip

584
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,510
I am NOT I'm a scientist

585
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,170
so but me I introduce to you that saw us
together

586
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,580
she's also part of the meat select yeah

587
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:42,320
my the

588
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,730
you know the test was gone problem I had
was the hacker problem but ever since

589
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,910
I came here yet coming to this
conference people have asked me a lot

590
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,850
you know we don't have any central
collaboration space and they're always

591
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,480
hackerspace is it would be great if we
had something like

592
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,570
the hackerspace village you know online
well

593
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,530
the metal out has hackerspace is dot org
it's an incredible resource

594
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,470
the hackerspace mailing list that all
the hackerspace is that are here going

595
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,510
to be on is at hackerspace it out or

596
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,540
let's give a huge round of applause for
the metal out for getting that going

597
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:17,540
that's of the

598
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,810
hello I'm sorry I'm from me that that's
too

599
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:26,879
but I have to correct that last point
actually hackerspace

600
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,660
is not by one organization but rather

601
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,070
by aka of

602
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:39,939
thanks Anna at collaborative of people
involved the hackerspace

603
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,780
also your past and we had hackerspace is
my

604
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,320
and basically if is a platform for
hackerspace is that the excess

605
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,290
to come together to share their no thats
to share their experiences

606
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:58,120
and hah pasta experience on

607
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,350
to people that want to fill the
hackerspace that

608
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:04,390
maybe do not yet want to yet

609
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,339
know that they want but at some point
have to build

610
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,500
a cast like the hackerspace is cut

611
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,780
we have now is maybe warm pointing

612
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,980
free seven-percent of what could

613
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,168
be help which

614
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:25,668
cast we r we r generating information

615
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:29,149
and sharing information that's the

616
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:32,730
in some way back to you freedom thought

617
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,750
and therefore is a democratic

618
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,399
and think we have to cough at whatever

619
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:42,460
show you now besides loca besides

620
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,970
such acts is home page because

621
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:53,690
why fight just started to work again

622
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,089
clap we have internet again

623
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:03,620
up

624
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,390
okay so this is the starting paid of
taxpayers' stop

625
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,740
or and XP

626
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,160
by now pretty much love you should have
a flyout

627
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,399
looks like this and explains what we do
on the backside

628
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,930
we have a acclaim day at which says

629
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,950
built the United multiply and which
means basically

630
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:30,129
thats wheat fields a platform as a wiki
page

631
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,100
as semantic wiki page actually and so
that everyone can

632
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,130
contribute to it can at information to
it

633
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:42,280
and one main part of that is

634
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,500
right here this stuff already existing

635
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,960
spaces some we we

636
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,109
we did not work way on the project until
now

637
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:55,240
it does by far Nazca Plate and by far

638
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,280
I mean by of of of our by far

639
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,270
and so everyone who has a

640
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,259
hecka spaces his death on the go
building at

641
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,910
shit and gets get to that page

642
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:12,970
and added this there's some members of
the panel

643
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,350
already complaining about that they're
not on the list

644
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:19,839
yeah I'm really sorry

645
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,259
these other only injured so we can see
US a space I have and I

646
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,270
no that this is by far not enough

647
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,410
but you're out here you have the
information

648
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,670
you said at the SMS contribute to this
page

649
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:37,910
not only to the list of course
everything out

650
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:41,370
said and the second main point is you
nice and

651
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:45,279
what this means is you you're sharing

652
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,210
information you're sharing your
experiences within the hackerspace

653
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,510
and there's a fourth is about building
hackerspace is a year

654
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:58,050
sharing information about what all these
very clever people

655
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,890
already set here and by far more because

656
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,069
you have the experience and you can make
others

657
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:08,470
knots phones at the same traps again
maybe

658
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,480
and how do you do that how could you
pull that off

659
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,310
and we have a mailing left

660
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,370
actually to Manning left at seven
specialist

661
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:27,940
and the announce list while announce
list

662
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:32,130
it's a mess its moderated list

663
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,240
the discussion list a shows

664
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,660
all information on this cost as well as
everything that's I would

665
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,920
recommend to sign guess unless

666
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,740
so you can ask a question if I if you
have one

667
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:53,010
and also on so or send for that left the
other thing

668
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,860
as a we have a Jabber account which is
Javor

669
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,640
dots a hecka spaces stock or I hope

670
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,089
all know what sever yes its and instant
messenger to

671
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,240
thinking I'm so and you can giant dust

672
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,380
ever account at the cool thing about it
is that when you goin

673
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,660
other medically have everyone that this
already on the hackerspace is the

674
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,399
cordless

675
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,440
list that account who has on the comp
list

676
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,920
at out a medical the whole list as at
its

677
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:31,410
to your account so you can pretty much
and fine

678
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,520
everyone is sign hackerspace a stark

679
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,520
now pretty much X and last find I want
to make and the a

680
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,690
the goes at of Fermilab I can is

681
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,930
that we may the hecka spaces

682
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,190
s a an open source project so

683
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,570
if you are in the go building space

684
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,660
and one no ass want a wiki page 1
whatever

685
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,730
their is Google document

686
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:13,730
back free I

687
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,390
iight tend to think that that was
everything I want to say

688
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:20,390
and I'm far over two minutes

689
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,490
I guess the

690
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:32,150
good from our point

691
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,500
independent wanted to spread the word
yeah

692
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:40,220
got if sampling spam other people

693
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,420
am thank you %ah

694
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,150
huge round of applause for hackers faces
outward

695
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,460
all right now and actually let's give
issue well were queuing up for questions

696
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,910
if anybody has any let's give a huge
round of applause to all these panelists

697
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:02,259
Kirk saying under two minutes largely
are

698
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:07,790
who else get anybody in the audience was
a member of the hackerspace a regularly

699
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:11,460
goes to events that actor space to stand
up for second because it is a lot more

700
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,710
than the people up here

701
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,410
that are making this happen I think it's
right off early standing up out there

702
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,470
I'll

703
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:24,950
and there's even one in Rhode Island it
was thought to a

704
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,970
character I love you

705
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,810
holy crap stood croatia week

706
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:38,810
I also see 0

707
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,819
what is there said is that there's a lot
of room for improvement especially if

708
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,720
you have hackerspace is contribute a lot
of your shared knowledge the hacker says

709
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,340
that or quickie if you

710
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,680
you know are interested in for you how
to build a hacker says we're going to be

711
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,830
dumping all our knowledge into this wiki
but for now

712
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,750
you can bring up some knowledge does
anybody have any questions out the

713
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,340
audience

714
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:05,820
back there get a life Mike out there

715
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:10,190
if a move to the front one of yeah
that's it there's another one up there

716
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:14,820
visits

717
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,150
so strongly opposed to a question I
wanted to ask

718
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:23,390
for for all the who honors organizes the
one in San Francisco how do you deal

719
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:25,920
with insurance and liability in case
somebody gets hurt

720
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,140
building a Canon I'm sorry didn't hear
your questions your

721
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,430
said it's kind of a killjoy subject but
how do you deal with the issue

722
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,660
insurance and liability in case somebody
gets hurt when you doing

723
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,790
slightly riskier things if that that's
actually not been a problem for us

724
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,190
I've been the one looking into insurance
but

725
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,280
when the people whose actually involve
Noisebridge has

726
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,470
a lot of research with insurance
companies and

727
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:54,040
all of them have had no problem at all
love with the word hacker

728
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,150
except for a 1 they said I'll

729
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,150
hackers the whole no way but all the
others

730
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,590
a its kinda surprising but they're just
hackers what you mean by hackers we tell

731
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:04,850
'em

732
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,130
or a group of people we have a whole
bunch projects and

733
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:12,640
you know the will be doing stuff with
chemistry and with electronics and

734
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,870
I don't care you know we just pay
premium and it's probably less than 2000

735
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,420
year

736
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,300
and we have full liability for the space
that will rent

737
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:24,300
plus some for liability for personal
injury

738
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:28,380
and Dom it's just a little bit more to
protect cell some

739
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,670
um the people on the board from personal
liability in case there's any kind

740
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,740
lawsuit

741
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:37,250
so it's like two thousand a year it's
not that big a deal

742
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,090
call insurance agents who will call you
back next question

743
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,130
I just want to point out that you don't
actually have to start of big

744
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,370
I've been running I approach sort of a
private hackerspace if you will for

745
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:48,810
about 10 years now

746
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:51,950
it's gone back and forth between my
house my buddies house we have a few

747
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,030
people over

748
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,800
on every Wednesday night get together
got banned with servers working on

749
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,050
different projects throughout the course
the year so

750
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:02,280
even though I know I'm hearing these
numbers have a hundred people now just

751
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,620
scare the heck outta me trying to
organize something even started with

752
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:06,730
nine people

753
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,150
can really get organize nine people I
just encourage people to have

754
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,260
hey maybe get your first buddy over and
they got a buddy in you start off for

755
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,510
two or three people

756
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:17,730
want to go out to Houston you look for
the hackerspace

757
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,490
great KK next question your good point

758
00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,930
another statement but a follow-up with
the liability for whoever was asking

759
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:26,680
that

760
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:31,609
I was involved with a built space in
Portland watershed PDX dot com if

761
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,100
anyone's interested

762
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:37,430
but the way they got around that with
their insurance they're actually

763
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,569
through their insurance company they are
listed as a vocational school

764
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,880
so not only does this cover them for
liability in the space

765
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,900
but people are using tools and equipment
on projects outside the space is still

766
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,150
covered under the auspices of that
liability insurance

767
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,090
so generally a commercial general
liability insurance policy would cover

768
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:56,960
you

769
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,420
using the spaces tools if they were
explicitly the spaces to

770
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,150
right Seattle's are donated into the
space

771
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:07,680
but if they're like see have an
inventory system for all the tools and

772
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,270
tools explicitly owned by the spacer by
the organization running the space

773
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:15,380
your commercial general liability or
your directors officers would cover

774
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,020
credibility for being used inside the
space so but that

775
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:24,750
I'm other lawyer look up the local laws
that's just Ontario

776
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:27,750
in a whole different country but
generally same thing

777
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,730
sorta because can it is not that
different next question

778
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:36,290
okay so I guess hope can have just added
a bunch of steam to

779
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,500
I sorry acker space in Montreal Canada

780
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,560

up your whole life worrying about

before starting a second space but the
to this

832
00:47:49,579 --> 00:47:52,690
a lot of the problems that you think of
beforehand

00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:57,579
will go away wants to stop the project
and also a lot of the problems

834
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:03,289
that you imagine has something to do
with the mindset of competition

835
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:08,799
wants to stop the space the world be in
