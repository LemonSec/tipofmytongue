1
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,380
of

2
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:32,560
here

3
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,670
okay I can't see anything

4
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:42,230
I hi I'm my lexicon

5
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:45,400
and %uh the tunnel this talk is macro

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,900
social engineering on this came to me

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,500
in Division one but night late night at
nada con

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,920
I and %ah I was thinking about

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,590
a macro social economics and Dom

10
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,730
for some reason the the terms just click
together

11
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,770
and I thought on what if you're talking
about

12
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,789
social engineering on a larger scale
which is what I'm

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,960
really interested in um so what is

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,190
Acra social engineering %uh well if you
talk about social engineering you're

15
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,920
usually

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,610
are trying to convince one person to do
something and if you could serve the

17
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,330
flowing your security is the guy behind
the keyboard so

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,380
bomb social engineering is normally
regard is getting past

19
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,979
a barrier up by interfacing with the
person than having them change the

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,010
system for you

21
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,100
or when you go past a checkpoint up

22
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,390
macro being a word mean large a

23
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,450
and %ah so putting macro with

24
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,229
social engineering talk about social
engineering beyond just individual

25
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:58,250
and the on the individual is the
community %uh

26
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,400
so I wanna talk about social engineering
entire communities

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,159
on there are many challenges which
cannot because overcome

28
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,200
in a short amount of time by simple
social engineering

29
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,299
if you want to strengthen your community
%ah

30
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:17,690
if you want to have a more ambitious
career you have to interface with people

31
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,570
in your field

32
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,579
%uh just on a large scale and %uh if you
I get somebody

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,959
elected president in the United States
you have to have ok kinda

34
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,190
group presents to do that you have to
you can't just

35
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:34,090
have an operator make a full are free
call for you and get some by elected

36
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,400
president United States book maybe
someone could

37
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,049
but %uh it depends on who you're calling

38
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,819
but our in that's that's kind of hard so

39
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,569
on mass mobilization is required and
many different tactics

40
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:52,840
on many times I've heard that members
have the CCC

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,170
influence German politics and technology
medicine

42
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,599
I don't know if this is true but I find
the idea somewhat inspiring

43
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,069
a imagine 2600 meetings being asked to
send representatives to washington to

44
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:06,720
talk about

45
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,859
telecom regulations on Packers have a
hard time being heard at all by the you

46
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,220
US government we have this wealth of
knowledge

47
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,709
the and occasional spurts of
organization like the free Kevin

48
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,400
movement or conferences

49
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,420
arm by that the same time work

50
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,560
still considered a fringe groups and
here we are with 3,000 hackers in same

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,209
building

52
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,120
possibly one of the greats collections
love thinking people on the east coast

53
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,950
at this moment

54
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,250
are and Tom or other

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,280
any US senators in and the these rooms
you know

56
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,470
are they here to listen to us there
they're not no

57
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,150
week we have to if we want to make
changes

58
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,510
on a national scale were on a global
scale

59
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,250
we have to kinda mobilize as a group and
go out

60
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,260
and get them to pay attention on

61
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,200
we're not well organizes as a group so I
would like to start a dialogue

62
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,099
about macro social engineering as as a
way of hacking

63
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,180
are group and communities

64
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,239
on there now love examples like

65
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,048
think I've for our hackers using macro
social engineering

66
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,829
as hackers on the organization of
conferences

67
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:26,770
maybe one other examples and %uh packer
labs like got hacked DC

68
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,659
archive a start by it the

69
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:34,919
real key in if you're really talking
about macro social engineering

70
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,849
you're talking about connecting all love
those labs together

71
00:04:38,849 --> 00:04:43,560
and getting them talking to each other
and starting to act in unison so they

72
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,370
can affect

73
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,570
a larger change to group they're
connected to each other those groups

74
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,169
so its it's going viral marketing you
know you get

75
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,750
you know a group in each city and
they're saying the same thing

76
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,930
and suddenly that's a buzz that's all
over the country it's not just coming

77
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,199
from one point

78
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,030
and so kinda the overlapping signals
will

79
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,949
start to generate acceptance of ideas

80
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,570
on so macro social engineering is about
mobilizing the community to make

81
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,240
something real happen

82
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,260
part love macro social engineering is
leadership

83
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,400
and you might think it's entirely about
leadership but it's really more about

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,250
mobilizing equals leadership is to

85
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,540
this as starting a conversation is to
normal

86
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,130
social engineering I think you have to
go beyond

87
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:42,990
simple leadership to be doing a macro
social engineering hack

88
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,479
so one other groups are doing this
already

89
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,039
arm who's who's good at macro social
engineering

90
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,139
well by lobbyists in

91
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,979
a influence influencing politicians are
fairly good at it

92
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,590
%uh and their example shows the scale
factor

93
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:05,590
pretty clearly you don't just need to
get past one politician

94
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,780
to have a political fact you have to get

95
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,330
you know a majority above the group
that's making the decisions you have to

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,449
get the entire

97
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,449
you don't have to get the entire city
council but you have to have the

98
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:18,410
majority vote

99
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,729
and you have to have a quorum in the
room to have was passed and that sort of

100
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,539
thing

101
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,830
on so obvious to a good example

102
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,099
love you know somebody who's already
doing this another group that's

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,229
good that macro social engineering is
artists

104
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,820
on I'm a fashion photographer myself and

105
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,840
up when I talk to other photographers
and other artists

106
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,400
are we're often talking about the
editorial voice

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,350
which is on when we put images

108
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,110
in a publication for instance the images
are

109
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,710
conveying an idea and their reaching a
very large

110
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,449
audience usually at least if you're
lucky I'm working on a

111
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:05,090
on but %ah the artist get to choose the
medium and the message

112
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,630
and job that's fairly important and Dom

113
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,509
they can speak to many people about an
idea without directly referencing the

114
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,419
idea

115
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:18,080
which you know with hackers were always
dealing with scary concepts

116
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,940
Tom but if you can talk around the scary
part

117
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:25,590
and still have influence that's that
something

118
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,380
to strive for I think the

119
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,460
of your friends I think they're kinda
the blackouts

120
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,530
up macro social engineering farm

121
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:41,199
their getting your corporate messages
out there in advertising and

122
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,509
changing people's minds about their car
insurance and stuff when

123
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,169
you know really if we get together and
talk about it why do we need car

124
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,930
insurance

125
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,669
help there's no real reason but because
it's for the system so

126
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,650
if you wanna fact systematic change you
have to

127
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:04,740
have I love arms in different places and
I don't think you can do this with just

128
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:10,100
one person you have to start with one
person it becomes a tree

129
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,840
and just kind of goes out and that
becomes a web and

130
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,210
then after a while you're connected
enough places where all these people

131
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,639
speak at once

132
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,430
and you know it's like one person in the
group a fifty

133
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,289
says something and it's a weird thing

134
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:29,930
and know my real pic really pays
attention but if you have one person a

135
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,819
group a fifty

136
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,560
and then he's got to coconspirators and
he says

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,120
oh we should all go jump off a cliff and
Dom than other one says

138
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,390
oh well I went bungee jumping last week
it was really fun

139
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,199
and then suddenly now everybody's
thinking jumping off a cliff isn't such

140
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:48,500
a bad thing

141
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,230
so on thats kind of the direction

142
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,480
you can take it I wouldn't get people to
jump off cliffs birth on

143
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,100
so I i won the people to be thinking
about what

144
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,209
they want to happen in their community
be at the hacker community

145
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,140
on state or national government or
anywhere else I think we need to start

146
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,110
how long can logging techniques and
commonalities

147
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,309
that span politics and sociology

148
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:19,530
and media print media production and
distribution

149
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,850
and other fields I am followed at all i
mean

150
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,939
I'm looking for people that contribute
to this because nobody's really talked

151
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:26,390
about

152
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,660
macro social engineering before as a
hacker thing to do

153
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,199
not not I know if anybody knows let me
know because I'd like to talk to them

154
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:39,599
a I've one central thought about

155
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,189
on macro social engineering about what
makes it work

156
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:46,959
arm and I'm gonna tell you that after I
read a

157
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,920
a story the i think is deeply related to

158
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,990
this idea and it's %uh Stone Soup by
Marshall brown

159
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,030
yon

160
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,069
can't pronounce the on the move the
award it's got but it's over

161
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:10,069
%uh but

162
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:18,130
it's from 1947 three soldiers trudged on
a road in a strange country

163
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,560
they're on their way home from the wars
besides being tired they were hungry

164
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,820
in fact the nothing for two days Howard
like a good dinner

165
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,960
tonight said the first and a bed to
sleep in so the second but all that is

166
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,370
impossible said the third

167
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,640
we must march on on the march suddenly
and have them they saw the lights in the

168
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,290
village

169
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,079
maybe we'll find a bite to eat there's a
the first and I love to sleep in so the

170
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,260
second no harm in asking

171
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,510
said the third now the present so that
place feared strangers

172
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:53,170
when they heard the three soldiers were
coming down the road they talked amongst

173
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,110
themselves

174
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,410
here come three soldiers soldiers are
always hungry

175
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,589
we have blue enough for ourselves and
they hurried to hide their food

176
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,000
they push Sachse barley under the hay in
the loss

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,390
they lowered buckets and knock down the
wells they spread

178
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:12,400
old quilts over carrot bins they had
their hid their cabbages and potatoes

179
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,430
under the beds

180
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:18,230
they home their meat in the seller's
they had all they had to eat

181
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:23,910
then they waited the soldiers stop for
some house upon France along

182
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,689
good evening to you they said could use
pyramid have food for three hundred

183
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,710
soldiers

184
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,310
we've had no food for ourselves for
three days said Paul

185
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,870
francois made a sad face it's been a
poor harvest

186
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,600
first three soldiers went on to the
house at Alberton weeks

187
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,680
could you spare a bit of food and have
you

188
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,260
some corner where we could sleep for the
night Ono said over

189
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,069
we gave all we could spare to the
soldiers who came before you our beds

190
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,280
are full said louise

191
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,740
advanced injuries the answer was the
same

192
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,320
it had been a poor harvest in all the
grain must be kept for seed

193
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,610
so it went all through the village not a
peasant have any food to give away

194
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:07,690
they all had good reasons one family had
used the grain for feed another had an

195
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:09,370
old sick father to care for

196
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,180
and had many too many miles to fill the
villagers stood in the street and side

197
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,050
they look just hungry as they could the
three soldiers talk together

198
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:22,600
than the first soldier call now

199
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:28,160
good people the peasants drew near we
are three hundred soldiers in a strange

200
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,770
land

201
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,250
we've asked you for food and you have no
food well then we have to make Stone

202
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,810
Soup

203
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,210
the peasant stared Stone Soup

204
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:41,690
that would be something to know about
first we'll need a large iron pot

205
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:45,560
the soldier said the peasants brought
the largest part they could find

206
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,430
howled through we going to cook enough
that's not too large

207
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,820
but it will do and no water to fill and
a fire to heat

208
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,800
it took many buckets of water to fill
the pot

209
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,620
a fire was built on the village square
and the pot was set to boil

210
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,640
and now if you please three rounds
smooth stones

211
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,060
these reason up to find the peasants
eyes grew round as they watch the

212
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,100
soldiers dropped the stones into the pot

213
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,650
and he subdued salt and pepper said the
soldiers as they began to star

214
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,280
children round effects on paper stones
make

215
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:24,189
these general stones like these make
generally good soup

216
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,950
but know if there were carrots it would
be much better why I think we have a

217
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,470
character to said France while

218
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,950
know if she ran she came back with her
apron full of carrots from the bin

219
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,980
beneath the right foot

220
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,170
a good stone soup should have cabbage

221
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:41,910
said the soldiers as they slight the
slice the carrots into the pot

222
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:45,189
but no use asking for what you don't
have

223
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,480
I think I could find the cabinet
somewhere said Marie

224
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,890
and she's worried home actually came
with three cabbages from the covered

225
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,560
under the bed

226
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,190
if we only had a bit of beef in a few
potatoes the soup would be good enough

227
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,720
for a rich man's table

228
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,720
the peasants thought that over they
remember their potatoes on the side to

229
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,140
be thing in their cellars

230
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,439
Iran the fetch them a rich man's to all
from a few stones it seems like magic

231
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,810
our side the soldiers as they stir the
beef and potatoes

232
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,540
as ice stirred in the beef and potatoes
if we only have a little barley in a

233
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,230
couple mil

234
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,210
the soup would be fit for the king
himself indeed he asked for just such a

235
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:24,650
soup

236
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,800
when he last dined with us the peasants
loved each other

237
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,630
the soldiers and entertain the K well
but no use in asking for what you don't

238
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,020
have the soldier side

239
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,980
the peasants brought the barley from the
Los they brought their milk from the

240
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,790
wells

241
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,030
the soldiers stirred the barley and
millet into the steaming broth while the

242
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,730
has doesn't stare at last the soup was
ready

243
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:52,350
all the usual taste the soldiers said
but first the table must be set

244
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:57,070
great tables were placed in the square
and all-round were lighted torches

245
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,360
such a soup how good it smelled truly
fit for a king

246
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,320
but then the peasants ask themselves
would not such a soup require bread

247
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,890
rose and roast and cider soon a banquet
banquet was spread that everyone sat

248
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,050
down the

249
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,170
never admit there been such a feast
never add the peasants his

250
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:17,510
such soup and fancy made from stones

251
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,790
they ate and drank and ate drank and
after that they dance

252
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,040
danced and sang for into the night at
last they were tired

253
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,780
then the three soldiers asked is there
not a loft where we could sleep

254
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,470
let three such wise and spun the
gentleman sleep in the loft indeed

255
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,770
they must have the finest beds in the
village so the first soldier slept in

256
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:41,260
the priest's house the second soldier
slept in the bakers house

257
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,089
in the third soldier slept in the
mayor's house

258
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,290
in the morning the whole village gallard
gathered in the square to given a

259
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,500
send-off

260
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,260
many thanks for what you have taught us
that the president's to the soldiers

261
00:15:54,260 --> 00:16:01,260
we shall never go hungry now we know how
to make soup from stones

262
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:08,209
with Solomon knowing so the soldiers and
off they went down the road

263
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:12,459
so the story is about getting people to
trust you

264
00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:16,329
and %uh it's about making something
happen

265
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:20,800
and and that the courts about giving
others and inspiration

266
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,910
to act in a way favorable to your cause

267
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:28,020
so what is the central love concept love

268
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,560
back row social engineering as a hacking
concept

269
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,220
I think it's when you say to a group of
people

270
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,260
give me a little bit and will make it go
a long way together

271
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:42,980
and they agree that's a macro social
engineering

272
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,860
thank you

273
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,060
any questions yes

274
00:16:54,060 --> 00:17:00,510
said

275
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,339
on I think there's a wiki for hope a
week he'd I hope dotnet

276
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,829
third arm we can put the link up for
macro social engineering and start a

277
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:09,439
pages

278
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,500
people want to contribute to that think
and my aunts

279
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,200
okay

280
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:25,200
thank you ok person the night

281
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,919
it well the difference is that

282
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,039
if you talk about getting one person
convinced of something

283
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,139
I'm considering about micro social
engineering

284
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:56,419
and if you're talking about more than
one percent and it's a community

285
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,529
and you have to get to people are more

286
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:02,730
to agree that something is a good idea
and two

287
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,730
to go with something that becomes the
macro element yeah

288
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,029
I'll its it's always in what you do with
it

289
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,450
I mean there's there's a lotta

290
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,630
politicians who do good things and do
bad things there

291
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:31,630
I think most politicians are con artists
ya

292
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,860
a complex name for a specific name

293
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,750
for general topic a way to communicate
about it because

294
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:45,750
once were given a name we can talk about

295
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,440
I think that is macro social engineering
I mean that that's why was I not with

296
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,700
artists is that

297
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:57,990
artists have that editorial voice where
they're deciding the medium and the

298
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,590
message

299
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:05,590
and they're getting out there to a lot
of people arm

300
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,920
I think certainly putting more are
responsibility about technology into

301
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,980
are public policy is

302
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,440
up good are kind of pie in the sky

303
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,010
reach for that at some point thing that
we need to get started on

304
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,800
mom by at the moment I don't have
specific ideas about this

305
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:34,260
X except I mean I'm an artist and I'm
working on try to get my work out there

306
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,440
so but that's not how I'm working on but
on also I i help Tom

307
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,530

308
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,889
arm I was living in North Carolina

309
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,160
are when I was in college and there were
no 2600 meetings going on

310
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,550
and so I put up and see 2609 or

311
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,810
and got a buncha farm people just serve

312
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,830
opinion like coming in the dire si
channel one and eventually were willing

313
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,350
in a row a meeting started

314
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,390
Tom and I didn't live in Raleigh but
Ohio's

315
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:09,440
helping facilitate we just had that that
central idea of having a website for

316
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,730
even though there were no meetings yet
and saying if you're interested

317
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,840
let us know you know and we just start
piling more and more people and now

318
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,860
we're doing a conference with it because
we've got meanings in different cities

319
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,820
within the state we want to have a
Superman

so just got adds up and

321
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,330
but I love doing the conference stuff
because you get to

322
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,669
get some the minds together it's fun
anything else

323
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,800
