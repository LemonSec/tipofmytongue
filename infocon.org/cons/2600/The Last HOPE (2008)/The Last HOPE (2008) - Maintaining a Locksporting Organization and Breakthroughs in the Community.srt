00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,779
for the first time which its second 51
hours

2
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,569
16 days too big a which is about how
long will take

this on a onesie on mines now a junior

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,859
invented the modern in time for design
this is the designer issey

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:29,949
around the world today basically cuts on
the key with the syriza pins tacks 2

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:31,099
pins in each stack

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:34,410
to where the split between the driver
and the keepin'

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,940
meet the line between the plugin that
she and and the

10
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,519
shell the plug is the part that turns so

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,170
when everything is right you see I'm
right there all these cuts will wind up

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,290
and the PLO can turn the lock will open
this is the

13
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:54,629
bases ripping much every lock design out

for the heart is a whore

55
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,390
we want to provide a safe haven for
people to pick locks

56
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,519
and and exchange ideas and we want to do
that

57
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,880
on a worldwide scale so that's what

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,819
we're here today to tell you about this
is a

59
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:49,810
picture whatever meetings in Austin

60
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,519
and this is extremely popular

61
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,690
competition that we've all and you know

62
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,530
whenever the competition will get like
his own the lock picking kit a profile

63
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,670
cylinder in his own hand has to take
home

64
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,910
and it's something that we do once a
year

65
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:12,870
and it's one of the most popular
meetings I

66
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,620
sold out US these are these guys are a
little smaller than a

67
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,560
lives for nationals from by actor show
body to body and even know

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:27,099
i'm happier same mission statement as
our side as this one advanced feels

69
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:31,180
and get lock picking up into the masses
lot of people are familiar with what we

70
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,639
do

71
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,400
I'm there the run compasses I hope

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,889
def comedy villages and they've got a
few active chapters in prison bosses

73
00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:43,130
cargo we hope to see a lot more activity

74
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:50,130
them in the future we have a nd magazine
non destructive entry

75
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,419
this is a a commune in a magazine
spreads the only lock sport-specific mag

76
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:56,250
out there

77
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,120
if you are have anarchy you what you
wanna write about locks

78
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,750
there's a good chance gonna get
published there are always looking for

79
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,430
content

80
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,430
I chose to release my medical tools
through them

81
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,770
and it's run by start on my burden and
John on

82
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,770
a cataract and as you exit she was
coming up in a week

83
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,930
so moving onto

84
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,169
on you know why start your own locks for
immunization way to spread the word

85
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,109
about what sport

86
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,510
you may have never picked the lock
before this may be the first time here

87
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,360
even heard about

88
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,840
walk sport in general but that shouldn't
stop you

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,180
we can still work together it is so make
it happen you want to be

90
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,219
kind of an expiry in a field that is
very

91
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:45,070
it's very young and nobody knows about
in this is your opportunity

92
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,729
expiry and start new things so

93
00:05:48,729 --> 00:05:52,930
you can

94
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,659
you know for me it was do is the idea of
being an expert in the field

95
00:05:56,659 --> 00:06:01,419
and I to get so far this is a picture
love me picking locks

96
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,840
underwater in scuba gear I which is that
no isn't

97
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,030
on IV right this is a picture of me
taking

98
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,690
the picture secretary you know I

99
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:19,690
its up it's easy to be an expert in the
field the nobody's doing

100
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,740
right so and you wanna be go for it and
people really look at look up to you

101
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,110
when you're like when you do stuff like
that especially when it's something is

102
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,349
course picking locks

103
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:32,930
here we go

104
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,060
are you prepared to vote your time and
motivation

105
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,659
starting lot organization a touchdown to
my hometown Newport News Virginia

106
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,250
we got through about three meetings the
couple 34 people each

107
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,030
increasing the amount a patient died out
you have to be committed

108
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,969
you wanna be the driving force because
if you are willing to shop at every

109
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:52,770
single meeting

110
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,799
and give a great show nobody's in a calm
so make sure that you have that drive

111
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,270
before you want to commit so

112
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,169
if someone can tell me how much money
would take to start a lockpicking clever

113
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:12,169
or lots where musician or give you some
pics shouted out

114
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,949
alright

115
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:23,379
so basically when you you need to find a
meeting facility

116
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:30,379
up the most important thing is you need
a computer hook-up

117
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,000
with the projector screen that place you
need music you need you to place for

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,069
people to come together and have a good
time

119
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,159
and music

120
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,090
is I can't stress that enough in like
it's a its may seem done now it's really

121
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,770
important

122
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,280
and come to rue people no one knows each
other you like what's going on you know

123
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,699
this is weird noise people

124
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,180
quantities we're doing

125
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,310
what's going on and people don't come
back you know

126
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,160
so a place you can try that work are a
little universities community colleges

127
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,300
I churches surprisingly enough have been
open to this

128
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,380
so I you never know and community
centers

129
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:16,380
as well

130
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,450
so you gotta be created when you're
recruiting on

131
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,590
the idea will sell itself you put up a
sign that says a

132
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,710
learn how to pick locks people are gonna
come straight to you nick

133
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,950
during a walk by the return on be like
way would would that's a

134
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,550
I that sounds really cool on we we did
is we had a sign that said

135
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,500
free lock picks and we gave out

136
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,070
these customized hands say

137
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,420
they say long-form article on and it's a
free lockpick because

138
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,449
you can turn it into a a a pic that
opens up

139
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,400
a alt series the kryptonite by clock

140
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,590
and you know people like was just a pain

141
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:06,600
we shouldn't you know we should have
worked in a

142
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,050
you know explains you know if well few

143
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,300
do it properly in weeks when the ethics

144
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,800
in of course and this is also

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,940
it was the during that Texas primaries
managed to get

146
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,780
we plan to having managed to get our on
banner set up

147
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,970
in name all over University campus

148
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:35,270
where they were on voting during that
week so everyone was coming to vote

149
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,060
and first thing I saw was a was our long
lockpicking standards so it was very

150
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,940
effective

151
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,860
we work sign the polls right

152
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,960
with your first meetings your sole
purpose the first being washed

153
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,060
organization should be together
attention

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,130
you need as many people as possible you
make is perfect as you can

155
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,689
if you if your contacts are you saying I
won't show up you should probably tell

156
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,980
your schedule around them rather than
vice versa

157
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,120
the goal is to get as many people in
there to talk to their friends and get

158
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,210
interest going and also you establish
ethics agreements

159
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,440
you wanna make it perfectly clear for me
out from the get-go that

160
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,690
we are not a criminal organization we
don't break into people's houses

161
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,800
so we do for the hobby for fun and to
influence the

162
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,360
the world you it's a good idea you're
gonna wanna

163
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,150
click membership dues and so wat fix at
that meeting after you step by step

164
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,930
experiments

165
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,390
and then later on you can decide if you
actually have meetings

166
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,480
is that where you actually have their
money first you can have the

167
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,480
meetings later you need lots

168
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,140
definitely lots of locks and you know on

169
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,199
finding lots is gonna be a challenge on

170
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,240
you can go to a locksmith and ask if
they have extra locks

171
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,830
ans you may have trouble doing that
locksmiths are the nicest people

172
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,970
yeah love us extra pics tools

173
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:09,090
files and supplements on

174
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,160
and was all talk about laters lots for
international help you with all this

175
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:13,760
stuff

176
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,000
you need a curriculum as well on

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,080
and you need to pre plan also from all
this cricket went for

178
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,290
euro box court date before the date of
your meeting

179
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:27,560
just sit on a table picking locks works
at first

180
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,590
but after about an hour so people get
bored

181
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,200
that you gotta have something lined up
well for instance

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,380
at one meeting you have shins and we
teach you how to open locks

183
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,040
coke cans the next meeting you have
handcuffs

184
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,199
meet each think that's you know and at
first people

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,080
you know they didn't know how to pick
locks week on stern everything except

186
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,430
taking off see a concert on

187
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,940
other types use your stuff like shins

188
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:56,270
and on will and France's the first thing
we did is we

189
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,329
we're talking to the local police
department as they said

190
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:03,280
know whatever you do do not teach
monkeys and if you're familiar

191
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,770
donkeys it's like a a its base it's a
key that

192
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,340
is somewhat universal kid with the
proper technique

193
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,820
open on most lots without much

194
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,260
much work and you know the kinda

195
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,200
we said our that's fair we want you we
wanted but he's you know it's

196
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,560
hard but but we're kinda running out of
material so the next meeting

197
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,560
give everybody a funky a

198
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:39,870

202
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm you'll find that people that haven't
organized with others will have a lot of

203
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,640
great ideas

204
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,949
and it's it's a good place sure those
and figured out on

205
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,110
hike up a sizable know where you are
what you are uniting in a random

206
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,880
stranger passing by lmao what's this
lock picking

207
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,520
and that's what you want we had
situations where

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,470
sitting next to us there is a group of
deaf people we taught them how to pick

209
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:15,860
locks

210
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,250
every this the only bar in Austin weird
every single bartender and staff knew

211
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,110
how to pick a lock

212
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,130
I so you know we definitely had fun with
it

213
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,320
spiderhouse cafe its

214
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,320
every every Friday night

215
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,850
this is the most important part of the
whole situation

216
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,600
and much and it's not butter on

217
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,000
lots for international as long as as
well as many of the

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,720
loss for the realizations are arm Creed
as we say

219
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,810
is don't pick locks you don't own where
they

220
00:13:55,810 --> 00:14:00,399
are not give an explicit permission a
pic and this is something that we

221
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,920
you know this is something that we eat
and sleep

222
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,389
by lockpicking already has a really bad
rep with the public

223
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,730
and if we don't work to change that's
never going to change the laws

224
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,870
the ongoing its offer the remaining a
harder sweet to persist and the public

225
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,730
and let him know

226
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,750
were not criminals we do this for fun
and

227
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,670
there's that there's nothing ordinary
about one thing we did is we let the

228
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,149
local law enforcement no

229
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:32,009
what we're doing on week the first thing
that happens we went to their offices so

230
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,389
why should we let you

231
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,170

view on bicycle safety

235
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,939

grisly into a

236
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,300
Police Department talk about bicycle
safety service

237
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,310
so he reiterated to the police officer

238
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,670
what the he had learned in that police
officers speech about bicycle safety in

239
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,029

I he said you guys keep we can work
together

241
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,889

do you have our name on your lockpicking
clubs

254
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,600
it's a lot easier to explain to a
curious bystanders in the police that

255
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,880
you're part of a a worldwide
organization

256

the first legitimate and this is EXR

257
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,579
from speech to meeting on Sunday about

258
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,720
ID card security school

259
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,559
Priya alright you

260
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,980
I is rising over I this person talking
to be about 20 develop called the medic

261
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,510
odor

262
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,600
its a it's very similar to those
developed almost thirty years ago

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,689
to open medical locks and I'm

264
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:44,689
amaze the number is figured out sense
ISO dominating wash perhaps most

265
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,730
security gate

266
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm not speaking on behalf of the Navy

267
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,139
you represent them officially in my
views are not so those

268
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,730
United is maybe the federal government
muscles begin we have medico

269
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,899
I'm not perfect human being my memory is
flawed

270
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:09,898
so if I see something up here don't take
it as gospel from the company

271
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,670
alright

272
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,090
medical arts used to be the holy grail
of Penn tumblers arm

273
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:20,159
since roughly the seventies they've been

274
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,710
the lock to attack and this is why I
became obsessed with them the

275
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,070
got a nasty reputation I used on White
House Pentagon embassies

276
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,210
I her room with a reason missile
launching systems the

277
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,060
the thing america's the pens have to
both lift like a normal lock

278
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,760
nasa rotates the right angle this the
compass by

279
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,590
angled cuts on the key other than a lot
and by the community open is lots of

280
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,159
them successful some not

281
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,540
we believe the the I have the most
consistent method

282
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,960
thus far develops through lockpicking
101 dot com an easy pick you know I

283
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,310
amish try to show you how America works
in one's life so bear with me

284
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:07,000
RI you can see the key right in the
middle that is America BAC silky

285
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,600
the cut side if you know sir angled and
those

286
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,140
cuts fit into the chisel tip that pin on
the right

287
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,990
cumple re: so what happens if you put
the key in there

288
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:21,350
it lists the Pens up and rotates at the
proper angle

289
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:25,100
now houses and forced what is the proper
angle

290
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,270
there's a groove going along side the
pen there you can see on the right

291
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,150
and that groove lines up with T on a bar

292
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,610
you see on the left over there and this
bar

293
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,990
must drop into the plug before the war
by a plug will turn a lot more open

294
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,980
up top you can see one that's my line
that metal pen right there

295
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,110
third from the front you can see a real
well its

296
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,730
that group is not aligned with that with
the sidebars of a little bit

297
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,510
thus the the cyber cannot drop in the
plot will not open

298
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,970
however with an opened lock

299
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,450
that the bomb as the property inserted
who knows that everything was group is

300
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,340
lined up

301
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,990
nice in the with those teeth on the bar
so we can drop in the pluggable terminal

302
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,160
oxo open

303
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,820
on the challenge is how you turn those
pins

304
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,060
you know this is in a bizarre huge key
ways but on

305
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,970
there's yet to find some way to turn
those pins consistently and effectively

306
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,660
nor open these locks so what this will
be demonstrated a little better demand

307
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,430
we had a

308
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,730
active cutaway America so under on

309
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:35,030
so it's a little bit confusing now then
and don't for it

310
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,780
who's open a medico made this big one

311
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:42,370
them I

312
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:49,370
very nice mark to raise your hand

313
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,500
silly creative answers get get pics at
the proof in the pudding

314
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,750
I alright

315
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:08,340
so I found some problems first one

316
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,770
open group this is ridiculous the groove
that allows those teeth in the sidebar

317
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,720
to drop in

318
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,030
goes always through the pen arm

319
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:22,310
my first question is why and there's not
really good answer

320
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,409
and what you can do is you can hook a
wire into the bomb that Penn

321
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,730
by pushing it forward and backward you
control the rotation

322
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,270
so that's as much most difficult part is
being able to control the rotation

323
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:39,670
independently and it's been the other
one is scanned the

324
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,020
um each one of these groups

325
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,070
once the lock is open once the Senate's
open state

326
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,850
is evenly spaced there's the there's no
very because this is a part of the

327
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:51,380
building

328
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,470
these all line up perfect purse
perfectly 1.17 inches between each one

329
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,490
and this hasn't changed since medical
was introduced back in the late 60's

330
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:01,270
early 70's

331
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,440
this the same for original box 2 m3 it
never changes

332
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:12,440
and the first or designs were aimed at
getting all those pens rotated it wants

333
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,699
you can see about how to comb thing
going on

334
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,070
these tools that not work at all that he
was the kid

335
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,270
you know rake in there and hook into
those pens all once

336
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,850
and then throughout spring tension on
the wires

337
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,270
the lot the pens which is a line
automatically in the lockwood

338
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:33,340
open and be a amazing I didn't work

339
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,949
you CJB well being used on the it's all
there

340
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:42,060
so how to be a better way I had to learn
how to hook in these

341
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,350
pins while the time I've a star with a
regular

342
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,520
that wireless is always .0 two-inch
diameter

343
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,060
believe and

344
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,790
I have openly america's with these
before

345
00:21:56,790 --> 00:22:00,580
pretty much just took into account
YouTube have feel like we all the clock

346
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,610
ticking you know there are false gates
but

347
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,430
it can be done with not with a normal
pic set to wire you can open these

348
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:13,070
relatively Kansas and this is the tool

349
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,560
the very beginning seven anyway I
started off with they are paper scale

350
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,929
spur of in Photoshop and wrapped around
on

351
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,020
then I went to a chisel the scale ice
over solder

352
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,810
are explain how it all works in a in a
moment when you see how this thing

353
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,909
started I didn't

354
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:35,430
make the party tools minute ago we have
JB Weld

355
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,000
plus the ghetto lave

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,480
the hot

357
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,520
access to a machine shop but I do the
power drawn some claps

358
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,060
and it turns out if you clap

359
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:57,669
your drill to your desk you can make a
pretty effectively

360
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,100
so that's why I used to cut the scales
now

361
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,340
hurty

362
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,620
art westall works is

363
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,280
you have two parts the the inner the
intersection

364
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,080
show the C

365
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,040
give us an hour to hear right it has a

366
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,230
mark right there that corresponds to the

367
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:31,150
and the wire your brother so issues you
looking into these pens

368
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,990
and then you use this as a you know

369
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:41,640
Rigo woo in this is the marriage I could
call it the

370
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,500
scale to it but sup against the father
plug face

371
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,820
in the sand in the o-line the mark on
the air tool

372
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,340
to the marks on the scale to these
leaving this place just like america

373
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,918
pins are said the group are

374
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,340
and by hooking in in moving forward and
backward in total marks a lime

375
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,250
you can set the Pens rotationally
there's no guess work there's no

376
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,760
there's no way that is just it's there
its right for you

377
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,220
and that's the a I guess the big secret

378
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,390
ever is known about the past 30 years
its

379
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,360
yeah I kept going and metal design
change that aluminum with changeable to

380
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,790
apps stainless steel outer jacket do a
demo ready

381
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:34,790
try and open an m3

382
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,070
so something you didn't really mention
is before you can use this tool you have

383
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,609
to pick the lock to the sheer line first

384
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:49,049
and once you pick shovel the lock to the
share line then

385
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:52,720
you'll feel a small a rotation in the
plug

386
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,200
and that rotation apply will give you
enough

387
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,309
on give so that the the tension has

388
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:04,039
Turk as been transferred from the the
pressure has been transferred

389
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,759
from depends onto the sidebar

390
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:13,340
and the sidebar is the mechanism that is
being bypass

391
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:20,149
by rotating the cans so he's good he's
gonna open it with

392
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:24,999
a the is a Peterson hook in a hour

393
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:31,999
flat ranch

394
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,919
you can open it with the close modus
mortise cylinder in anything to do with

395
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,640
the cutaway sooner afterwards

396
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,640
you can see what's going on inside the
walk

397
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:04,610
all eyes on you I no pressure

398
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,640
some looking into the Pens now star

399
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,640
back see see this on

400
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,129
house

401
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:26,720
the inner mark is just a bit after the

402
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,360
the scale mark trying to Islamabad push
you forward

403
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,430
downs

404
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:39,070
on

405
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,889
is a 6-pin that's correct

406
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,940
so you effect respect is a factory

407
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,420
is in effect a specific specifications
mark is

408
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:59,420
yes this is an altered in any way

409
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,360
I

410
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,929
this this would be a good time during
the year

411
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:17,929
walks board meeting to start music again
no pressure

412
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:48,260
all good

413
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,930
it right away on for schools in some

414
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,680
first but see first thing a close-up on
the a

415
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,920
cutaway putting the key in an hour you
know

416
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,360
somehow managed to lose the correct key
for this one so

417
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,460
put in the incorrect key this is made by
a gonna miss cappers right now from

418
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,400
roasted beautiful coloured

419
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,910
exactly how it works although the
resolutions

420
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,660
body on might come by villages silly
things work

421
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,680
yeah just isn't

422
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,680
this is

423
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,900
more

424
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:48,110
your boo

425
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,340
arm 17 this to us other works

426
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:56,090
I was really surprised my first reaction
was live in people in the community far

427
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:56,710
this

428
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,610
so well want to do is Lisa publicly

429
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:05,560
to let her know what happened outside
that through nd magazine on destructive

430
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,490
entry magazine

431
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,510
and our consensus was that we should get
a manufacturer reaction

432
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,310
what is medical think about all this arm

433
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,360
we got quite a reaction indeed
Petersfield

434
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,360
Petersfield is director of research at
america high-security locks

435
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,050
after %uh speak with Mike I got through
to him

436
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:34,620
through nd dog Han

437
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,310
and and and and you are Peter talk on
the phone we arranged a meeting you

438
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,360
wanna drive out

439
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,440
it turned out they just happen to be
based in Virginia growing up

440
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,040
so it wasn't that difficult for me to
come out so he dropped my apartment

441
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,020
scholar town also showed up he's the

442
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:53,170
editor-in-chief nd a magazine 10 Diana

443
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,700
disclosure um weeks heart for

444
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,030
a good seven hours just about locks

445
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:06,350
it was great lot geeks is right history
show me tools was it was a really fun

446
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,310
time I

447
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,370
appears a great guy but up in the end

448
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:14,540
their response to this tool was we're
gonna reemployment

449
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:21,440
AR axe this is not on their expenses
actually in all medical original pen

450
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,060
I put this in here to show that they've
known about this before

451
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,260
this is not brand new there's a toe back
in the seventies that

452
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,060
works similar to mine it couldn't pick
them but it could decode the angles

453
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,159
and use the same up sidebar group to do
so

454
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,000
um they've been they've been used in up
too much government applications

455
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,670
since back still came out in the
eighties every other medical of the most

456
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,290
part has been open and vulnerable

457
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:53,520
for the past you know 25-30 years so
they decide to reopen meant

458
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,280
they rx as a standard so every single
medical are coming off the assembly line

459
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,250
is going to have closed room air expands
and this tool

460
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:09,250
is no longer effective this is their ex

461
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,950
the question we're ask ourselves why
isn't this shit standard

462
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,950
you see there's some really neat up

463
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,250
pan sear 0.01 I really enjoyed

464
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:26,160
sure the group

465
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,500
exposed the bottom how you can look into
that

466
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,930
not but I Arts is basically a smattering
of random a extra security

467
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:42,150
features for the Pens the makes decoding
and picking much more difficult it makes

468
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,890
my to an effective and others like it

469
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:48,560
as far as a few goes

470
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,679
arm even live in a minute this was you
keep going

471
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,480
with medico with everybody OSA primis
multi lock

472
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,490
outweigh doesn't matter it's in your
hands

473
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,060
locksmiths that they're no longer
breaking these locks that that's that's

474
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,440
not what they're a job Description tales
anymore

475
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,280
it's gonna be up to the locks were
community and hobbyists like us to find

476
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,340
the vulnerabilities

477
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:14,370
if you find something you think a
significant you should just

478
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:17,650
just think before you thought of it on
the internet

479
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:22,070
you know it's a it's not a I do you def
have to go to manufacture

480
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,230
especially the nasty with you just the

481
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,570
consider the fact that your actions
might have on the general public

482
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,720
John how long have you been involved in
what's for community

483
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:35,650
are roughly three years but a

484
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,650
this medical thing started back in
November those last our research on it

485
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,580
and

486
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:44,199
anybody could do this stuff out this
that this is super simple

487
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,890
he's got a look at the system that so we
do right for hackers

488
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:52,300
we brake systems this

489
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,750
0 skip down very

490
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:00,820
discussed it that's life should be
deleted so in conclusion

491
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,020
on the locks working he's growing
rapidly so it's basically it's a great

492
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,260
time to jump on board

493
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,720
and we're gonna help you do that if you
decide to

494
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,030
on

495
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,360
starting of organizations agree we are
such leadership there's very few

496
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,440
opportunities where you can show

497
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,950
your caliber as a leader and guiding

498
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,780
people in in their endeavors and
starlight for is a shitty way to do that

499
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,020
it's uncharted territory

500
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:35,020
bus relations can also inspire driving
fun new research

501
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,710
I think yes set forth I've gone from
locks for national and tool

502
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,710
have really helped this tool for
development

503
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,790
when it will be a people sending you i
mean i i got

504
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,260
locks tools pins peep was 2005

505
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,650
about this they were sending me just
mounds have stuff

506
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,260
because they want to see it succeed

507
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,190
and that he would you the motivation to
keep going when you have people out

508
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,630
there

509
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,640
there's that just as excited as you
about breaking these locks

510
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,070
you're gonna keep going and

511
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,100
most importantly %uh lots where
international and

512
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,819
locks were in stations in general
provide a legitimate channel for

513
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,510
our growth are hardy and you know we
want to change the social climate

514
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,580
and different aspects that are
preventing the growth of our hobby

515
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,529
and by joining in supporting
organizations like ours

516
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,790
we can do that so

517
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:37,770
on the away in roughly the Newport News

518
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:43,879
I was stopped at the at the security
gate morass camel oxide UPS my pics

519
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:48,319
but still have you noticed my locks on
me CSA was pretty interested but thats

520
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,070
standard the local police asked me

521
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,680
what do you do my collect locks is that
all you're doing with them

522
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,680
the answer is yes officer

523
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,319
but the real answer was no not at all I
open locks in this is what I do

524
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,500
he specifically asked me do you have any
tools

525
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,600
and I'll have to ask if your license if
you did and that's bullshit

526
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,029
these these things don't don't harm any
buying has a responsible people

527
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,990
I think that the law should not impose
stricter up

528
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,660
more are restrictions on if you actually
caught doing something bad

529
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,720
because the vast majority must have
these tools are completely ethical

530
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,560
and locks for organizations are the way
to make that climate change

531
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,560
thanks guys

532
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,840
if you have a question then we'll give
you some pics

533
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,120
I will also be selling

534
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:59,120
a so pics in the water bill just so you

535
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,570
riser I mark Tobias were given a speech
i

536
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:10,290
at six o'clock this evening also on
medical and layers of complexity

537
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,730
and I think John are to be congratulated
for

538
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:17,780
pushing medical over the top to
implement their expense which should

539
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,100
have been done about 15 years ago

540
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,580
when are when a very sophisticated tool
was developed

541
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,069
over England for breaking these locks
arm

542
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:31,930
you also need to understand that they
are expense or not the end to the story

543
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,819
I'm not at all they will render John's
to all

544
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,180
ineffective because you can't pro

545
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,710
the bases appear but if

546
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:46,050
we introduce our new book today

547
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,310
for everybody on opening medical locks

548
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:53,490
it's a very detailed 3ds and we're gonna
talk about it at six o'clock but you

549
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,620
need to understand this is the beginning
is story not the end to this story

550
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:01,759
these locks are still vulnerable it's
just they're vulnerable the different

551
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,380
types of techniques

552
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,380
but I my co author is here to buy us
blues manaus

553
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,140
I some over other research stream is
here I

554
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:15,290
are toby's best time I'm not as good at
picking locks is toby is Toby's best

555
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,120
time is 27 seconds

556
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:22,819
for a6 p.m. lock and soul this is really
not the end to the story and if you guys

557
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,830
are interested

558
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,540
in how medicos work and what we're
talking on at six o'clock is layers of

559
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,680
complexity

560
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,770
and how r manufacture can get themselves
into trouble

561
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,710
the more complex you make things just
like software the more potential for

562
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,890
products

563
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,120
and the more potential for exploits arm

564
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,220
we have supported Loch sport in the
media

565
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,280
for quite some time and been very vocal
the locksmiths and I'm a member there

566
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,560
organization for a long time

567
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:55,810
they do not in the main like lock sport
because they think it's a threat

568
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,859
it's not a threat and this is not a
criminal

569
00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:03,620
hacking enterprise this is really

570
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,330
a lock sport community in my view is not
just opening locks

571
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:12,029
its teaching how to think differently
and outside the box

572
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:16,940
and how to analyzed former abilities
every lock works perfect

573
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,020
but it isn't perfect and it's the best
intellectual and mechanical chess game

574
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,740
going

575
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,600
so we would urge you come to the
lockpicking village John's going to be

576
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,630
there very well

577
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,980
on Friday I my partner I'll be there
Matt further myself

578
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,400
and would be glad to answer questions
everybody's gonna demonstrate

579
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,500
on medical and other locks we're glad
you guys are interested in this so we

580
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,330
would encourage you to pursue it

581
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:45,910
think things like John thank you Mark

582
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:51,460
yessir

583
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,839
why like he said plans to take to the
sidebar

584
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,490
would you say

585
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,620
it's all to do with hearts lock

586
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,630
you can is is this the part that that's
the a basis for a lot of marks book

587
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,970
is a core i7 the code first and then
picking this year my approach is

588
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,750
depicted as your first

589
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,100
and then and then do this I park out the
way you

590
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:19,339
you can choose is the interesting thing
if you do clockwise tension

591
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:22,880
the she'll I'm all set for Steve to lift
them and then rotate them but if you

592
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,109
tension counterclockwise in almost every
case

593
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:30,240
you can set the cyber first so that this
could give your pic

594
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,870
whatever's easiest for you yes sir okay
I

595
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,650
I miss the first few minutes so forgive
me if this is a rebbe question

596
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:42,250
but the it's been touched on a couple
times about the legality

597
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:46,000
you know and you have a license for your
tools I'm just

598
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,240
wondering your what is the the licensing
in the legal

599
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,850
love survey atmosphere surrounding
owning these tools

600
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,609
is it something that's done at a federal
level is it done it is state by state

601
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:58,520
level

602
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,640
and if it state by state where can you
go to inquire about this without

603
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,580
for example you're giving yourself on a
watch list

604
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:11,319
um it is state by state there aren't any
federal law somewhere I think there's

605
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,339
some for shipping

606
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:16,230
for shipping locksmithing tools to
people that are not bona fide

607
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,890
lochness but that term is pretty loose
but all the legislation visit comes

608
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,500
under state and local level

609
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,220
for example in New York City I believe
it is illegal to own pics about a

610
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,440
licence

611
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:32,630
was pretty interesting police have a
field day in here now

612
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,330
but how can do it safely and effectively
I would just die I it's a tight

613
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,509
legislation and know that

614
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,460
I didn't know that I I think you said
earlier that your memory is sometimes

615
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,310
faulty

616
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,890
probably in LA thank you

617
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,690
know if you want to find out more
information about that you can go to

618
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:53,070
lock picking 101 dot com

619
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,740
and many threads about the different
lost different states

620
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,940
on most states there are no laws a

621
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,040
about not about owning locked XP size

622
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,730
if you are how having then with the
criminal intent

623
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,230
so on their are very few states

624
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:17,120
about legislation against my pics in
general

625
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,859
a common theme topic here I actually
attempt to get a locksmith

626
00:41:20,859 --> 00:41:25,210
ask for to set of pics from him I tell
me that they were considered burglary

627
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,730
tools in New York State

628
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,500
and the only way to possess them would
be always be a licensed locksmith

629
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,540
and then why ask them how I would become
one kinda

630
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:36,609
shut down he's gonna do you know what
puts

631
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:41,490
process to become licensed I I would say
check the web site's root for local

632
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,930
stuff for your state

633
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,629
I'm an expert on that because I'm allies
is myself

634
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,820
don't tell anyone but I find a locksmith

635
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:54,760
demand no less about laws and even the
locks them

636
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,920
the hobby is due these days anyway over

637
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,400
maybe even have a membership card in
your organization would be enough to say

638
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,960
here's my card you know this is Paul his
license I mean

639
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,140
no now I but my peanut butter somebody's
as hell

640
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,950
okay on they could get you have a
situation has never talk to lawyers

641
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:14,960
anything about

642
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,089
this on I talked to a couple

643
00:42:18,089 --> 00:42:22,160
burglary lawyer wants and he said that
based on Virginia law

644
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,640
where possession without licenses prima
facia evidence of intent to commit

645
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,720
yeah robbery larson et cetera was felony
he said that if

646
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,780
that others are you ready for me now but
if I were gonna rest he might be on bail

647
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,839
me out his card

648
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,509
this thing is is that it's never been a
problem because

649
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,660
the members that we have an organization
have been

650
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,060
respectful on the level that they've
never been in trouble with their luck

651
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:50,359
Inc its and we've just you know we've
never had that problem

652
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,420
it has yet to be tested in waiting for
the day I won't be that person

653
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:58,830
right

654
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:02,020
so I sort of have a two part question
one is

655
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,589
these AREX locks are they

656
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:08,660
medico I take it this is all recent

657
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:14,330
when will be fined blocks in stores with
a rx

658
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,660
the last time I talked to make Oh
they've said that they are

659
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,720
coming off the assembly line right now
fixed

660
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,550
that's the word I got I have not gone to
america locksmith yet to confirm that

661
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:30,030
and I think you be guided do so soon
because I wanna find out if

662
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:33,470
there told the truth or not and guys
just seconds no quick

663
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,790
so my mom the what effect this have with
regard to bonding

664
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,910
who with pumping that's a good question
was marked by us

665
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:46,290
he is the medical bumping I guru

666
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:51,220
moment

667
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:55,089
we a lot to answer the first for your
question real quick we the new pin kits

668
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:59,150
are already in the numerical pad a
medical catalog

669
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:03,500
so okay well let me address a couple
things first of all air expands have

670
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,480
been available since 1994

671
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,740
they chose not to implement them cuz ur
expensive and so they sold them but they

672
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,720
didn't implement them for free

673
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,280
now if they implemented for free um I
just wrote

674
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:21,080
a to editorials on our blog iNDOT
security guard or

675
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,370
that addresses this issue and John's
Medical order

676
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,960
and the the whole issue I've responsible
disclosure

677
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:32,080
and liability and who's gonna pay for
all this so the real question is what

678
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:35,720
happens to the millions and millions and
millions of locks that are out there

679
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,640
that medical has known about this
problem for at least 15 years if not

680
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,549
thirty

681
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:44,380
and not addressed at as part of their
standard locks

682
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,020
I that's the first issue to answer your
question about bumping

683
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:51,570
I can tell you and we'll probably
demonstrate

684
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,600
at lockpicking village I we've

685
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,050
we could demonstrate and it's in our
book I

686
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,859
with bumping medical cylinders with AR
experience

687
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:06,200
this is why I made my comment air
experience to not

688
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,950
exactly solve the problem they make a
lot more difficult

689
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:15,120
but for pre 2000 December 2007 medical
locks

690
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,069
I we develop for work he is that will
allow

691
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:23,500
picking and bumping I love virtually all
of them

692
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:29,440
I after 2000 December 2007 they added
2500 side bar codes

693
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,560
so then we have up to 16 keys but those
are drastically reduced

694
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,299
it's all documented in the book but when
i'm tony is for keys

695
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,100
for most every lock that's made by
medical in the world that are non master

696
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,870
key

697
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:46,500
can be picked and bombed with the use
those four keys

698
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,560
and so this is it's a great puzzle

699
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:54,049
it's the beginning in the story but it's
not the end the story

700
00:45:54,049 --> 00:46:00,790
you marked up when tom is that talk
thank you

701
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:04,460
by I am force wallach grounds would you
recommend

702
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:07,560
lock your own homes I

703
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,230
is there enough I currently have a a
piece if shit

704
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,230
master key to select my front door
because my apartment will uninstall

705
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,620
Morris

706
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,520
which is insane but I would recommend
right now

707
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,890
the she like Primus is a very good very
good lock box that's my current project

708
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,009
right now spread Primus

709
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:29,750
om be on that the the ever MCS is

710
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:32,980
its out things will be open anytime soon
personally

711
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,480
uses them mad embedded magnets

712
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:41,510
their sidebars it said there's a lot
more to security than just the law

713
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:45,160
chances are the burgers that the break
in your home are not can open the lock

714
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,000
unless they're

715
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,960
you know a government agency sir

716
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,210
I have two quick questions the first
there's been a lot of talk about this is

717
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,010
the beginning of the road

718
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,940
first question is has anyone services
discuss

719
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:05,319
as anyone posited an idea for breaking
news

720
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:09,490
taking these new locks with your expense
within any

721
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,859
theories with their ex that's been a

722
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:19,350
marks about marked by such techniques do
not do not rely on the open cyber groove

723
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,330
can you

724
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:27,160
there was a there was one there we go

725
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,420
about alright

726
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:33,549
this is this is one other this is not
iraq's again this is the predecessor to

727
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:34,259
it

728
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,000
this is not a backstop and the only
difference is back soon original

729
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,040
is that the at the above the pin and
thus the cuts McKee

730
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,240
are shifted for dinner after it doesn't
affect the picking aspect of it all it

731
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,940
still works identically

732
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,850
but you'll see there's a false groove
going along me up in there

733
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:55,970
it goes all the way through on a on a
lot these are our expense

734
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:01,370
in one method digging them open up the
brain goes group cause of

735
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,950
get a really really really really been a
liar

736
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:09,049
a minute want it that way I've had I'll
limit success with that

737
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:14,410
it is possible and the that's one way to
a defeat them

738
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,200
other than that we're just gonna have to
away from marc's book and see what he

739
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:17,930
comes up with

740
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:21,230
Picasa do it manually by the way you
can't you can rotate the pens with the

741
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:21,970
hook

742
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:26,460
if you have the mental dexterity do so
and sucking personal assistant

743
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,720
thank you no thank you

744
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:34,540
what material or your Michael Ochs made
from

745
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,230
again what's the material them that pins
are made from

746
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:43,500
and wire--the air it's been so difficult
to manufacture or expensive

747
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,810
the a the Normans are made from either
either brass balls using steel

748
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:53,060
Arriba hardened inserts eric's is
difficult to manufacture because

749
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:58,120
the moment all kinds a will overall
changes and it's not how it's not easy

750
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,279
to do that just off the line

751
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,210
the Sears all kinds of all serrations
and what not

752
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,390
and its about it takes a lot longer to
do that and it just you know

753
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:13,000
roaches lot down the Penn and whether or
not that is significant enough

754
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,830
to not standardized um I don't think
it's significant enough the cost

755
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,930
agonies to be secure and that's the
point all securities the

756
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:25,290
magnetism can be used to manipulate
artwork Institute on them

757
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:28,549
up possibly the that and I know we have
in a

758
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,120
explored yet but I it's it's it's some
look out for

759
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,450
but your model I these pins are going to
Brass which

760
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:38,600
I get him act as present much lower
thank you

761
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:42,670
met one more question you first

762
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:45,730
lockpicking 101 excellent long time

tool that makes it easy

767
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,720
thank you II stop the same way I i think
that the medical paper mache

768
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:09,410
and I opened at night this took way too
long there's gotta be a better way

769
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:12,629
it and those are impressive because
their really tough some no

770
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,609
the question is your picking at first

772
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:24,460
after you those pins or I

773
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,880
serrated top ones and then the 3-2
bottom

774
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:31,359
this the mushrooms

775
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:34,630
such I'm actually a horrible lot bigger

776
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:37,900
such groups is just is it like when you
pick mists

777
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,049
to other ones picking America this year
before he said

778
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:45,730
sidebars exactly pickin on the lock the
I find the mushrooms were actually

779
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:49,160
easier than say like I like a normal
spoken

780
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:53,430
you you can feel coming out of our other
false at their pics exactly correct or

781
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:53,990

782
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:57,650
I'm also climbed to give the a give a
lot to this fellow who once be

783
00:50:57,650 --> 00:50:59,520
competition at Afcon

785
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:05,850
that was collared downside with that
with anyone inside

786
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:08,940
no it's not but it does take a long just

787
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:12,900
fine that's the mean the tension for
secured

788
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,910

and stick it somewhere around inside
defeat most people

792
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,569
tried well most people is a relative
term you know

793
00:51:28,569 --> 00:51:33,319
North ickes was mcilvane to get through
it but even so if you start where extent

794
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:36,900
your five pins are vulnerable and you
know I'm going to rate the last bit if I

795
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:37,890
really want to get in
