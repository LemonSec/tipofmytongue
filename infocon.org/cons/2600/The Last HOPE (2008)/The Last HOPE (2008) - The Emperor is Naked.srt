1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,959
the body him a is a first question
excellent

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,490
%ah you might not be able to understand
me because I'm ENGLISH so if you can't

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,379
just write things I'll attempt to

4
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:12,519
adopt my app some right earn

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,340
as you can probably tell if you can read
on the toilet this call sucks of course

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,110
even

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:20,480
a tight let's talk brothers the
emperor's naked a.m. or

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,140
I can be I'm performing profit by me how
why aren't you working men

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,390
I'll start again in a moment's

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,399
next

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:36,550
and give that we go side

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,129
first question who are mine and what the
hell am I doing here

13
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:43,780
well as you can probably tell buddy
ebsen I'm based in the UK

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,460
I make a living as a secure console on
and

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,550
and I am generally also around the world
and get paid for a

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,100
I am the Genesis talks largely as a No

17
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,160
actually it to sell anything on and I
don't

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,040
actually have anything to prove just had
an idea also don't want to run past

19
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,370
and everybody in this room to find out
whether or not I am in fact wrong

20
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,420
which are very probably am so I

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,380
Qatar disclaimers I am I wanna get a
suit

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,339
I'm eyes were pointed out that my
current paymasters in no way endorse a

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,409
poll

24
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,960
on like this talk additionally

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,970
and if you use anything to say during
the I'm

26
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,520
duration: this talk an end up actually
breaking anything that you own all

27
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,820
that somebody else's I'm homes I'm not
liable in any way shape form

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,399
all legally acceptable some so the
world's soap

29
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:38,720
um yet another disclaimer disclaimers
call um

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,250
should be pointed that should be were
pointed out before start the BART right

31
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,929
amount of cash in God I'm stunned
applications

32
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,750
understand a base by down to some
networks an

33
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,710
long list of them talking about I'm in
this talk is largely a result

34
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,530
being drawn with my friends and
basically I'm coming up with the ideas

35
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,189
which we can improve on my the other

36
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,759
and lottery a lot the and material in
this is preliminary research vol I'm

37
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:05,420
sales

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,140
largely I can't prove it so I'm

39
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,560
oh yeah in Palmdale not is if you know
any bout let me know

40
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,560
results the entire point and the entire
reason why I'm here suck one gonna be

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,970
talking about bro chance for areas

42
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:26,140
ion want basically a general
introduction to

43
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,570
on the topic a virtualization to I have
a breakdown of virtualization falls

44
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,260
unknown 3 I

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,399
home an interesting idea while I pound
on full

46
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,189
and something else wont

47
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:46,879
your sup I am before we begin and

48
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,390
I was working on a clients I a while ago
on notice something a little bit weird

49
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,940
and the standard logic out there goes
the on

50
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,440
in a win32 Logan environment on

51
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,740
I'm especially if you're running a day
%ah

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,090
the maximum password limb struck use
nightline prison terms 2720 characters

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,590
I am unfortunately Aeon

54
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,720
one particular instance and I was no
marksman lamps etc in the main security

55
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,370
policy

56
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,050
all inactive directory itself so
basically what that means in concrete

57
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:19,680
terms

58
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,410
is that once somebody's authorized end a
password reset pulse any string that

59
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,930
warm

60
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,380
to you by the local machine instance and
also talk to directory

61
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,859
cool what that means in practice

62
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,340
is I'm crop people for overflow Maher
404

63
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,620
if you pass a huge strain to a day

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:44,530
it falls over I'm stops working which go
interesting I'm going so true mass

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,870
I am don't know is why but basically I
came back inside ok I

66
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,800
I'm it's not 127 we lied its up to 999

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,680
on which point I decided to do a lot
composting

68
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,800
I'm injured my hand are so I'd and
getting about 8,000 and Renee characters

69
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,050
when but see Microsoft and I said

70
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,260
please pick up now don't tell anybody
about this and so

71
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,540
I am no sub basically it could be a fall
in now

72
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,659
I'm ms I'm itself I'm

73
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:19,060
well been sick i three anyway but
whatever is definitely fall in demand

74
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,400
and that particular and some soda main
ski operators I security policy and

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,449
probably in the ID compact as well

76
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,729
a.m. you might think might be thinkin
what on earth is this got to do with

77
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:29,800
virtualization

78
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,840
but it does have a point and I will get
to it like up as long time genital

79
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,690
information in this all-time gently the

80
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,630
but it does I'll tie up at the end
probably each sure

81
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,360
do seu nome talk about stuff on there

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,570
big thing saying hoops that's one that's
when they've got too much sleep do a

83
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,169
check on

84
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:53,099
well to Microsoft York you I process is
over

85
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,520
so couple quotes we like quotes are
always good um

86
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,669
first one from patrick glynn who's a
senior director product management

87
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,180
product management VM us should know is
talking about known as virtualization

88
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,330
open opportunity in a frat and one from
Albert Einstein he probably knew a bit

89
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:08,950
more

90
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,090
inasmuch that if we knew what we're
doing it would not be called research

91
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,270
sup to begin

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,700
I am has lots of seller about
virtualization

93
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,160
in fives everybody's talking about
virtualization is a light is my mother

94
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,850
let's all jump on it but largely its I
have found a bug in BMI

95
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,580
on-site aches all I have found a book in
via the Emmys are

96
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,169
hypervisors on I'm almost I am because
I'm

97
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,630
India I'm going to focus on more than
one area

98
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:42,090
am us a lot so it's not that talk about
the 'em-up specifically

99
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,060
or if not about VMware about the whole
subject to pop on virtualization silo

100
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,990
up virtualization hardware noble yada
yada yada an

101
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,070
I'd like to talk about research
specialization which is a bit more

102
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,980
interesting for its

103
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,730
does things like a grid computing and
clustering and what's a good stuff like

104
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,280
that

105
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,120
soul if I can commitments were

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,560
which is opens defendant so up

107
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,150
puffin virtualization sure you're
familiar with I'm gonna break it down

108
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,640
further basically

109
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,270
in a typical deployment all a
virtualized platform instance or

110
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,240
instances

111
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,270
you can find combination virtual
machines custom host operating systems

112
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,729
virtual machine monitors

113
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,560
hardware obviously and allegedly does
robin play nicely in a virtual machine

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,500
environment whether or not they do was
are considered by

115
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,370
site um has been a wall research out
those five star own platform

116
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,290
virtualization

117
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,410
I which I'll cover of in a bit but
there's been so tall

118
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,700
I'll very little I'm for all research
focused on the security

119
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,830
all results virtualization on

120
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,500
do you solve virtual servers
specifically grid computing

121
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,090
is growing largely because learned no a
number

122
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,170
economic and business drivers behind it
which saw but in the UK

123
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,320
and you've got virtual resources are a
big although I am

124
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,770
the been deployed across sectors I'm see
got scholar systems running it in the UK

125
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,719
we've got the National great which by
city powers everybody happy everybody's

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,250
house

127
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,330
running on route virtualized resources
which is rates

128
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm in the US which is why I am and
you've got

129
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,740
virtualized resources specifically a
super times which been run

130
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,300
by the large continental Amazon South
America

131
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,500
disap- interesting the end of and
various on the dot mil agencies all room

132
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,060
super times because they are cheap

133
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,460
well fordice up and both process

134
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,470
and wonder where I which ask our systems
can

135
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:42,490
all be mailed it to fit quite nicely in
a virtualized result in varmint

136
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,960
so effectively you've got national
critical infrastructure

137
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,320
on defense systems running on bein else
appraise

138
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,700
so why is it

139
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,440
the everybody's reviews in virtualized
resources well the being campus for warm

140
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,910
love it

141
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,210
ion largely because it's cheap instead
running nice conventional lands which

142
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,090
everybody understands and everybody
knows how to manage

143
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,880
and they can base the title and put it
on im all in one box

144
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,510
I wanna miss try to look up to the box
is said to the team and upside to

145
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,120
Fortune

146
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,010
the issue that dole is actually
deploying in a sensible and secure

147
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,580
manner

148
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,890
man is a bit of a problem I'm

149
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,360
I'm gonna talk about threats in a minute
but it's worth

150
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,380
and defining what I mean by what
constitutes a secure virtual machine

151
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,049
environment

152
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,549
by settlers a number my rules which
already my rules are stolen because I

153
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:37,309
steal everything

154
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,950
basically and the

155
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:44,910
entire Jen services that things have to
be kept separate you part

156
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:49,230
platforms and politicians should be caps
up bro I'm specific issues like

157
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,300
I memory allocation within statue
pickups opera

158
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,320
is still be scrapped a scaleable and
basically

159
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,570
users and I'm arava operating systems

160
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,620
a to get above guest should be able to
instruct the post and

161
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,460
most important thing issue in BI you
should be able to turn it off

162
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,700
a.m. easily shall we say because
obviously if you've got

163
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,880
medical systems running on a if you've
got %ah

164
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,040
minor things like I power grids running
on it

165
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,500
maybe should be able to know sup um

166
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,870
gonna talk about research has already
been don't specifically relations

167
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,490
platform virtualization

168
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,320
on a lawless you already have heard so
feel free to help me with my desire on

169
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:29,920
food

170
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm New York expensive what to do eating
and but yeah

171
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,880
basically lot people have already broken
all other choice environments

172
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,080
and there's been a huge amount of
research in this still is

173
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,110
love research is focused on PMI specific
like got the reasons for that

174
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,720
86 get hold of beats widely deployed and

175
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,350
seats quite fully today sup and quick
recap of what's already been

176
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,790
don't and father not basically

177
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,219
its work break and I i'm what research
has been done already into three key

178
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,350
areas: basically

179
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,090
detecting virtual machine instances
bypassing the protections over

180
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,380
allegedly implies and I'm and destroying
the virtual machine instances

181
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,939
so I'm ash everybody talks about
virtualization

182
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,510
always uses analogies which don't
usually work I

183
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,390
the cave the matrix so I'm basically
gonna steal the type 1 because it's not

184
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:28,680
alsop but basically allows me to make a
bomb Joe can use the phrase case in the

185
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,240
cage

186
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,710
site there's been what research has been
to been

187
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,990
kids wats detecting virtual machine
environments um

188
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,340
you can't detect virtual machine
instances number wise

189
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,170
I

190
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,660
on in shepherding processes memory chip
specific reg files it was platform

191
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,740
specific files

192
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,389
and you can look for specific memory
artifacts I E the incident table 2

193
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:52,130
scripts are using check RTT

194
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,389
Sentra Sentra problem without is VMware
getting a bit more lawyers on there are

195
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,880
actually attempting to build rootkits
nap so finding

196
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,189
up virtual machine is since is getting a
bit trickier but still can be done using

197
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,899
any combo any combo those if you can't
be asked if you're lazy man like why am

198
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,730
you by city will still the red pill
which you on a rope all you can use a

199
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,399
host of other tools exist I scrappy
Jerry Davey and it acts

200
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,410
amps VM detect is highly entertaining as
much that's one click on it does it

201
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,130
I am however and there are more than one
way to skin a cat

202
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,360
and it's an interesting morning which
nobody's looking up on

203
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,290
there's an issue we've detected virtual
machine environments at the moment

204
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,300
on quite major warm from a time
perspective in as much that it sets them

205
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,089
you first have to be authorized to them

206
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:44,190
which is a remote attackers really kind
rubbish I am

207
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,750
at Saunders and im so guarding guys are
at the moment looking

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,949
up and I days in network had us really
not necessary on a

209
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:58,089
thank you and although it's interesting
near China iffy

210
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,630
basically another way of doing it is
because the timestamps

211
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:05,120
or of in virtual machine environments
you can use those time stops to

212
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,510
a statement here in a virtual
environment or not on

213
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,630
the times times being a raw IMAX order
in law firm

214
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,730
bull it makes disco BRRip no be easier
at the moment

215
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,319
there aren't any publicly released tolls

216
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:21,079
but there might be on the way soon
depending on whether or not I can be

217
00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:21,759
almost

218
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,089
archive so once you actually established
to rain

219
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,660
a virtual machine environment what can
you do I'll well

220
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,669
as some spy last year on July last year

221
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:35,149
its crudest demonstrate range
replication is concerned by possibly a

222
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,879
virtual machine sections which were to
look a bit more detail

223
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:42,129
prime basically I number evolves

224
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:46,799
found and BMO station form 5 I'm
probably in six dollars not publicly

225
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,478
admit to

226
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:51,919
ion as I'm sure you're all posts in your
web cameras goal.com Shaw

227
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,179
was referred to as bud or II which
allows for the host in Goa

228
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:59,858
guest OS is to actually talk to each
other which is nice basically what it

229
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:03,489
does is it subverts the x86 instruction
set which is in VMware

230
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:08,019
and allows for insecure into host
communication shall we cite

231
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:12,179
obviously that makes the entire concept
a memory separation which is

232
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:15,789
allegedly the points oval this somewhat
redundant

233
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:19,339
an and found a number of breakouts

234
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,399
and without too much effort and I was
could be

235
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,829
accomplish with all without p.m. souls
actually being installed

236
00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:28,879
basically what he did i am.

237
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,539
A's release a sweet soles are not really
see talked about suite of tools should

238
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:34,049
cite

239
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:38,069
on a movie and shot them at: pay BM can
be a drag and drop

240
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:43,959
ultra compact router basically I could
drive the mall in detail but that's

241
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:44,619
gonna be dole

242
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:48,169
re with the Internet is wonderful by
sickly dunno re am

243
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,730
chance kinda interesting as much that
opens up a number I D S

244
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,160
basically what being shot dole's is
allows fall

245
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,379
Chuck clients been planted between
Justin Houston apparent systems

246
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:02,739
okay basically how it does that aids
that uses de la injection attack

247
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,560
so the lawn now

248
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,350
I'm afford to be opened up in the memory
space which can be then used by both

249
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,180
instances

250
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,700
unfortunately the issue of goal

251
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,230
is the its cutest won't release the
souls am

252
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,390
he won't share the information all day
there is a crude

253
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,020
am which actually generate a date
largely because the research the

254
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,339
was conducted response by a very lovely
people at the Department of Homeland

255
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:27,279
Security

256
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,339
I it's worth wondering why the
Department of Homeland Security actually

257
00:14:31,339 --> 00:14:32,810
looking at virtual machines

258
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,520
on whether or not they actually use some
nice I'll themselves I wonder

259
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,490
so basically Anna I decided I wanted
suffered

260
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,630
attempts at trying to do that so I
looked around for a bit more help

261
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,470
thankfully and and basically I think

262
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,680
run across the same person I run across
which is can kite side

263
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,540
is Japanese got and and he released a
suite of tools

264
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,610
told the un-backed and a spot the gaza

265
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,779
call obviously run across as well site

266
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,370
can kato and the people that can cater
knows

267
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,080
I've been looking at the back door I
have functions all BMI for years

268
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,420
basically for by utilizing a

269
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,650
inbuilt functionality nvm by what
they've done is developed a number of

270
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,839
cross-platform time online by Stolz

271
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,980
and including internet back door and
allows for

272
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,960
files to be copied between justin has to
bring systems again memory separation

273
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,370
find redundant and very much EP which
last post in gas to share files through

274
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,410
p.m. shared folders

275
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,740
which call-ups recently pops to do that
I'm

276
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,190
shout fold upbeat sup I am

277
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:42,860
obviously if you use the MFT pay it may
be possible to climb p.m. shop

278
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,160
ago does establish a chance ever host
o'clock

279
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,770
guest and AM don't I'm gonna his ascent

280
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,270
amazing ion if it can be done not and
there's no reason why can't

281
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,709
the separation between guest host
operating systems can be bypassed

282
00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:02,510
yeah simple site interestingly no of

283
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,730
and destroying virtual environments is
pieces at bar which separates best but

284
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,730
is adorable

285
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,390
Joey psych on their number souls that
time so matisse

286
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,270
released and most notably trust me and I
force which basically

287
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:19,870
do what they say say on the tent and
does I am

288
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,430
a group German researchers call DR NW
which been building a lot research a

289
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,080
lifetime so the intricacies of German
law they can speak about it publicly

290
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,240
marvelous I'm basically

291
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,040
most virtual missed machine instances
but for gas platform virtualization to

292
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,190
be made to fall over relatively trivial

293
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,959
so I am as I said at the start less

294
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,820
and there's been a lot research is
focused on platform virtualization

295
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,270
specifically

296
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,780
on does not been a lot vulnerabilities
and salsa

297
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,290
been released and undoubtedly moral be
on coming shortly

298
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,280
and the separation and the isolation
that was promised by the deployment

299
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,870
virtual

300
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,170
missile forms doesn't actually seem to
be that and the problem is though

301
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,390
the that's just warm small part of the
equation as much the

302
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:11,000
okay let's look at VMware but VM at No

303
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,900
if you're talking about proper pic
systems them using VMware detail using

304
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,179
resource virtualization now using big
you know it but not resort to that

305
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:23,439
really much for him a couple of quotes

306
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,500
about this but namely a looks like them
to buy as a one three technical manuals

307
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,830
I am an ankle biter I've read a techno
for technical manual and obviously is

308
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,480
from the wonderful missed the mark of

309
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,870
on which I'll proceed on to go into
details at this audience for

310
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,260
on a but quote I'm are more apt but by
myself is that there's nothing more

311
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,910
dangerous than the results for Lydia

312
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:49,830
I am NOT results for Lydia suck this but
it's going to be incredibly dull

313
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,010
but I am gonna go something somewhere
with this I promise you basically

314
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,490
its really really difficult to talk
about

315
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:01,300
virtualized resources without talking
about and memory design models

316
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,889
which fascinating sorry about that own

317
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,060
wanna most interesting love recent years

318
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,139
is no need for memory access all
allocation on

319
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,570
those views are unfamiliar with much
less memory architecture which I walls

320
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,710
among and a quick break up to those are
familiar with that

321
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,040
I apologize in advance for a huge gross
technical inaccuracies in

322
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,030
generalizations

323
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,450
Anna said earlier I am going somewhere
with this I promise you

324
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:29,560
but basically simple simple

325
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,700
laws have computing 101 processes will
always robust some members are such that

326
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,990
ion CPU's adapt to stall

327
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,169
I'm such the way for memory access and
basically to get around that

328
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:45,360
I am simple play gym a number projects
have been on site and so Lifehouse

329
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,400
high-speed access to memory newman's
wanna member

330
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,630
many got I'm old sex goddess Richard
virtual memory blah blah blah

331
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,330
an but what it seeks to do is provide
two separate member instance for each

332
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,320
processor

333
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,200
tell sprays I am name is not really
deployed

334
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,580
in real life on base it because it does
work

335
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,909
%ah von Neumann architectural models
coding make

336
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:12,350
the implementation to NUMA virtually
impossible nobody's actually done it yet

337
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,500
and they have however and got around the
restrictions in place by moving to catch

338
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,050
here in

339
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,710
on you from memory allocation basically
what CC NUMA seeks to do

340
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,990
is maintain the integrity of data which
starred in like

341
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,560
crashes shot resources and also

342
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,190
the integrity of data stored within
multiple I'm will to process a system

343
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,419
memory

344
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:37,820
on it's used in most close to computer
models

345
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,050
and it's also deployed in most virtual
resources

346
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,320
and subs are out there HP super times P
Series integrity Sabres

347
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,939
all of them use the CC new model am

348
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,429
there's a lot of people attempt to
explain CC NUMA by

349
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,380
analogy people's a game about their
knowledge is not analogies argument

350
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,650
and the example is always used to skate
banking

351
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,350
now as a brick I don't understand cake
baking

352
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,610
bicycle the closest I get cake baking is
using a microwave

353
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:12,700
occasionally so I came up with a better
one largely about drinking site

354
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,690
imagine you wanna for alleged reply all
complete a process to put in CT New

355
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,309
Times

356
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:21,520
to do that you gonna need a lot be a for
memory pages

357
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,290
you can get a lot be a in your fridge by
a local memory however

358
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,070
your neighbor has some fantastic vodka
you wanna steal

359
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,379
una barra dozen remember it you want to
get from quickly

360
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,130
that's kinda the point some local
storage is good however

361
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,650
you've got a fridge the only hold so
much I physically able member

362
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,410
so what you need to do is that your
neighbor to hold some GOP wants to steal

363
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,070
that doctor

364
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:50,610
if local memory school allocate memory
remotely say

365
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,620
much better than take Mikey site as I
promised I am going to go somewhere with

366
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,010
us

367
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,830
basically I first came across CC NUMA in
2007

368
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,010
which is a better now Lulu five years
after the rest the world

369
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:08,280
on as I've said for others talkin I will
probably signed and I am incredibly lazy

370
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,750
man

371
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,740
on will not learn about things unless
I'm absolutely false to learn about

372
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,260
things

373
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,460
basically how it came across it is the

374
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:19,790
a don't cook line in the UK balls
looking to book flight nice flat land

375
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,620
and into a single virtualized resource

376
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,410
I specifically house pizza but I'm on
the UK doctor

377
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,360
UK dot gov client upset dime particular
for NSU

378
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,400
is a wonderful wonderful NHS yes we have
free health care

379
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:38,370
I'm basically on as you may or may not
be aware in the UK

380
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:42,000
and I currently trying to allow for
connective tissue between every aspect

381
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,110
to the NHS so

382
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,250
you look local doctors surgery will be
able to get your

383
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:49,960
a medical records as well a local
doctors surgery

384
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,650
house by John on the problem we've all
that is you need a spying for the state

385
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,450
to go over

386
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,809
those fines got to be skilled in cryptid
which -ism at the moment

387
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,580
and instead of actually building and
nice

388
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,510
understandable network that everybody
gets because this is being generated by

389
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,190
the private sector what they're doing is
a look at cost savings

390
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,350
so the pony only one box because finna
that's cheap

391
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:16,610
we could spend half a million pounds all
we can spend lots and lots millions of

392
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,060
pounds

393
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,330
we spend half a million pounds will make
more money let's put in one box as part

394
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,320
of the process

395
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,460
and idiot boy he wrote to a risk
assessment

396
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,840
fence coming across NUMA so is worth
looking at how memory works in a super

397
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,159
time

398
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,710
and logical starts 10 I'm and that's why
I researched according to the literature

399
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,929
the HP themselves have pushed out

400
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,679
in some za die white papers that
marketing soap and their conversations

401
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,440
with me

402
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,620
and it was kinda similar to dicks

403
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:51,620
cave so you've got multiple input
multiple processors

404
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,290
%uh full within a cell you've got local
memory in sleeve memory

405
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,320
and data communicates by crossbar and
spices

406
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,050
very dull such am broken-down

407
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,090
aside am into

408
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,540
64 individual processes with

409
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,340
18 more eight cell now full cells under

410
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,699
yeah HB they a I you got low clinton
sleep memory

411
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,200
inspection by crossbars and i/o
connections

412
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,560
by within a cell an external to a cell
and the important bit this

413
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,590
Anna is that if memory card right to
local processes cell

414
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,290
alt rights neighbors there's allegedly
proviso in the

415
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:36,928
architecture that says that come across
more than two crossbars ball

416
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,900
there's only four first ball so who
really cares about I am

417
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,570
I could jumper on about locality demands
but they're actually very very dole

418
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,760
on the entire point locality to my
name's

419
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,669
though is the the for the way a
processor is in terms of where is

420
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:53,919
situated in a Cell

421
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,800
the longer its gonna take to read to
them and right to that particular cell

422
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,350
so I'm yup

423
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,640
basically the memory bits important
inasmuch that you've got local memory

424
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,550
instances

425
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:10,460
which are allegedly restricted to the
storage a private objects

426
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,679
whatever those private objects are who
knows on

427
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,720
local memory can be accessed by any
process however Sony process in the city

428
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,270
in 18

429
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,480
a big piece of mind can access that
local memory

430
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,560
all the local me instanceof any other
processor the further is a white

431
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,280
the longer it takes and want on in
sleeved memory

432
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,500
Tom store shared objects and
instructions

433
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:37,250
and allows for universal latency across
the ball sack any process assigned to

434
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,020
site in terms of any cell can access not
a a relatively rapidly

435
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,520
an interesting thing about and sleeve
members is accessed in a round-robin

436
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,620
fashion served up

437
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,090
the first just around around around
again so I'm there is a gaping floor in

438
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,709
this

439
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,330
on which I kinda sport namely if you can
access

440
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,610
in control on

441
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:01,190
what individual processor and I'm you
can only access the memory space

442
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,960
adult process %uh all the all the
processes not just within a cell

443
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,610
instance but across the whole virtualize
resource

444
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:12,380
so prosecute Knology okay let's say
you've got nice plot line you might be

445
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:12,650
able

446
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:15,890
popcorn box right you popped box win I'm

447
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,900
you may be able to segue further
incident some lights a point

448
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,840
and elevated privileges et cetera et
cetera such resources

449
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,709
if you own one process all box you know
love them because they all share the

450
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,150
same

451
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,040
memory Evan issue so basically

452
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,510
to break it down simpson's instead all

453
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:39,020
injecting malicious code into memory war
machine

454
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:44,010
you can now inject malicious code into
everything and if an application errors

455
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,340
all

456
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,260
an error state is created maliciously
and becomes process augments thinking

457
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,440
particularly here about

458
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,910
I'm up on XML discuss that's a nice easy
one everybody gets

459
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:57,830
basically more than one process against
comes the part is the first process will

460
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,710
try and processor

461
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:02,050
build on that's natural dot go to next
we'll

462
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,320
died basically if you can own

463
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,409
a single processor in fact a single
processor

464
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,560
of hope the resources up a single
processor you get so much Leone

465
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:16,510
in fact of old the inside virtual
results also put in

466
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,500
all the terms the network replacement as
said earlier you basically get lands

467
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,440
putting boxes

468
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,460
light lines you can unlock deploying
more

469
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:31,460
all sported a lie for people you do

470
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,470
I apologize for the Python reference
side

471
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,590
the issue is am so all will never happen

472
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,680
you while tonya found not actual fall
it's not gonna be exploited

473
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:46,960
well is worth and looking at whether
this technology is being deployed which

474
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,950
is why I started

475
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:51,340
with done if this talk to be don't I'm

476
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,220
right but it better not be able to be
done because its ruling National

477
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,580
critical infrastructure

478
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,429
in a a suddenly in the UK were put in a
national health service on that

479
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,840
were also we've also put the power grid
on their vol supple

480
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,050
on please command-and-control on that
we've got very expensive defense

481
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:11,250
on that and you actually covers but a
defense to welcome and the Banksy play

482
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,950
if this happens we go back to the Stone
Age

483
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,680
we can only get health treatment became
known the fly we can no longer a

484
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,060
we can no longer have some notation we
can I don't go to the doctors

485
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,240
we no longer have health insurance and
the military running around but where

486
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,300
orders coming from elders to shit

487
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:32,770
so bad not happen so and how is actually
being deployed

488
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:36,389
well as a senate basically what they're
doing is it taking normal lands

489
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,280
and place them in a virtual environment
specifically about resources

490
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,460
unfortunately what they're doing is

491
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,810
instead of using sensible network layer
separation

492
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:49,250
these wonderful things like they are at
my virtual route info but it I am

493
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,340
the problem ace in a lot of instances of
come across

494
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,530
and don't do you probably saw instead of
having the %uh play the DB liar

495
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:00,840
US-led now now no got us a silly idea
what we'll do

496
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,330
is to speed up the prints a speed up the
way that operates will put the app and a

497
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,639
be on the same left but a

498
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:10,050
I am in some za building in adequate
protections

499
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,919
you cal actually doing I am I know from

500
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,880
the arms my own stuff to don't to
actually get auditing

501
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,660
working and in a virtualized results
environment is impossible

502
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,610
and prosecute sample different client
not the NHS

503
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,480
by simply said okay what we gonna do we
got contract commitment we've got to

504
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,490
order any security-related about within
twenty five milliseconds

505
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,740
in your chance largely because

506
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,410
on

507
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,720
it takes long a long time for the dates
governor to that

508
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,620
you talk to build a actually getting
ideas some firewalls is a pain in the

509
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,220
ass because I DSM far more than just for
all the nice sticky patch goodness that

510
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,450
says this is virtualized

511
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:55,679
ready owns ion how is it possible

512
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,470
to moments update to transactions

513
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,540
which may be potentially I'm a legit
summer environment

514
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,700
where basically doesn't stay afloat in
around anyway never picked up so

515
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,630
somebody else's Marie

516
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,480
don't do it another thing that's
happening at the moment and will

517
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,780
continue to happen

518
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,580
is losses being cams and got involved in
this is that okay we need to deploy to

519
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:18,980
love it

520
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,280
deliver and get this rolled out as soon
as possible because the sooner we get a

521
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:22,639
in

522
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,880
the sooner we start saving cash we don't
have to pay network admins them operate

523
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,549
I'm the problem is by doing is a quickly
they're overlooking the basics in

524
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:30,590
opening files

525
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,910
the put in virtual router follow up
holiday you know cuz

526
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,580
you can take a you take Cereplast
separation just uses not on you

527
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,590
so you might have a perimeter firewall
but which passed that you're in

528
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,830
and you don't because a site on your
blog so

529
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:49,649
the important bit all this is this is
just an idea not to release PRC

530
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,910
I'm not gonna say here is my code:
basically I haven't done any research on

531
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,660
peace areas and I don't want to solve

532
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,120
I am amo Senate look largely because I
can't afford to prove it

533
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,770
and the Superdome instance the cheapest
I've ever found one

534
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,100
this was very very dodgy second on
problems fell off the back of a truck on

535
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,640
a bike

536
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,429
was up pan out 65,000 pounds which i
think is about four million dollars

537
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,910
%ah a

538
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:22,010
but yet they're not cheap time to buy a
new one you look in a half million pound

539
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,840
some million quid

540
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,140
are million dollars I should site which
and my girlfriend loves me but I think

541
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,049
if I spend da

542
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:33,080
on a computer she would kill me and I
also can't afford to spend on a computer

543
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,850
on pence asking for autumn vegetables
early so I can eat

544
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,590
I'm but yeah basically the very
expensive on the very rarely deployed in

545
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,309
environments that people can get a

546
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:47,389
I'm if you are if you actually can get
them the restrictions are in place in

547
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,140
some za contracts all please don't blow
up it cost us a fortune

548
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,390
on because that's so difficult to get
hold of

549
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,390
I am you can't I can't prove this which
makes me feel like a Dolce

550
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:02,909
but also presents a real challenge in
terms of securing

551
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:05,980
on the memory space at those virtual
results instances

552
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:10,010
insuring the isolation which was
allegedly bill insomuch lies a nation

553
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:14,770
and also in terms security research
itself which is why nobody's looking a

554
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,820
I am now I realize it many of you may
have an issue with this

555
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,559
so I did the reasonable thing I spoke
with Coach pay

556
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,178
on they were far from happy with me
basically

557
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,920
their initials on

558
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,590
response was okay please tell us about
so I did

559
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:36,300
unlike okay please stop talking is about
please go like to be example the

560
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,140
actually said

561
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,460
and this is important but is I am CC
NUMA is more not no more or less

562
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,570
vulnerable than the same number
processes associated the monolithic

563
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,070
memory

564
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,320
that too if an attacker can get
privileged access to process a

565
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,280
they can write to the memory the whole
process is Sharon group that love

566
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,070
execution

567
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:56,379
minor issue with the %uh it is much
tougher

568
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,420
in most I am. monolithic memory
instances

569
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,800
you've not got your entire network so in
a

570
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,390
they kinda miss the points am

571
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:12,030
HP would not actually tell me what
protection mechanisms rebellions that

572
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,550
stuff have been talking to hate

573
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,210
and Ibn a bit lately about their
implementation virtualization

574
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,660
and their that kinda open socket about
protection mechanisms but you know

575
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,640
obviously they're not public knowledge
please don't tell anybody home she

576
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,840
in 2009 by Ibn we can probably do that
got away with it HP on the other hand

577
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,380
bases

578
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,930
%ah we don't have that they're gonna OS
level the site

579
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:37,170
okay this is why kinda begun with the ID
thing because

580
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:41,350
a day all ladies wonderful skill with a
manager nevers using ActiveRain 20

581
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,490
but if there's an issue in now and this
probably

582
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,420
all the issues in the West which are
probably just a significant and

583
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,830
if the OS is flaky and sometimes all

584
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,040
virtualized resource that basically
means you're inside a virtualized

585
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,180
resources toast

586
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,040
I'm a site I got such a tight space %uh
choose me what protection mechanisms or

587
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,280
than the last time you got

588
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,550
%ah they haven't told me but I still
have insomnia

589
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,930
spoken to them for about the last six
months and avoid them constantly and

590
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,480
consistently but they won't tell me

591
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,790
and they would tell me why don't tell me
which leads me to suspect that there

592
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,470
aren't any

593
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,660
because that there were there maybe
we'll tell me does even

594
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,960
aside even IBM to upside I'm or no
commercially sensitive please don't

595
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,380
mention it

596
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,200
have told me HP have atomic which leads
me to suspect that the crossbar

597
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,920
instances

598
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:34,450
are kinda naked un so my issue with this

599
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:37,780
isn't our architectural model is
designed polly

600
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:42,830
implementations be open I processes can
access each of those processes by Marie

601
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,870
that's the point how does that %uh
suddenly becomes a key or enclosed how

602
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:48,220
do you actually look back down

603
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:53,250
and did some point this is instead of
just owning a single processor instance

604
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,470
you actually on the network you know
dustups the points

605
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,900
so as I said earlier I the really

606
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,600
don't like discussing things are calm
prove an

607
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,090
largely because I tend to get beat No
but are spoken to lots of people about

608
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:08,370
this

609
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,730
with enhanced p.m. external sites bass
boats Art Center's

610
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:15,810
tech designs by Obama everybody are
spoken save cousin disagree

611
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,668
this is the third time given this talk
an hour

612
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:23,299
hopefully somebody in the room will
disagreement but the point is

613
00:34:23,299 --> 00:34:27,379
if i'm wrong. I'm at least not rommel
I'm on

614
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:31,018
its %uh type under some curry trying to
get hold of a super time

615
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:34,129
so if anybody actually knows a response
to put I'm hanging around

616
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:37,909
I'm if you could let me know about it
not to be too right

617
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,919
grime a as much figured out

618
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,569
do much less secure doing virtualization
are implementing virtualization securely

619
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:50,599
is a bit of an issue and is made more of
an issue in as much the

620
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,230
researchers are only looking at one
error technology I the look in a

621
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,039
platform specifics of

622
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:59,740
on a settler know why this is happening
because I just as poor as me

623
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,809
they can afford it either but it really
doesn't help for the Reliant all

624
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:08,819
placing your trust in like a pet likes
of HP and IBM and hoping that a copy of

625
00:35:08,819 --> 00:35:11,910
which not really that comfortable an
idea

626
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:16,220
am point is that realities now intruding
on

627
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,000
ion virtual instances inquire majors I'm
stunned said why

628
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,720
i am. this love organizations out there
I'm some which have mentioned some

629
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,519
which will continue to mention them so
like other issues women and

630
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:32,529
doctor botched the moving towards
basically the Big O in single box single

631
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,690
point of failure option

632
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:37,829
to Siena unlike plate network latency if
you ban all in a super time

633
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:40,990
if you're super temples over NACA una

634
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:45,220
in the real world basically all separate
components

635
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,680
all IT infrastructures its Carino I'll
be lumped sensible results

636
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,109
so instead all

637
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,509
I on having an application security
manager

638
00:35:56,509 --> 00:36:00,210
a security manager network admin I'm

639
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:04,450
a firewall ghali no idea ask I don't
perceive go on guys trying out

640
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:07,848
a manage applications that databases
network topologies and

641
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,609
opponents all in one box because that's
the point I said they wanna

642
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:15,808
donor place internet works in time it
was sports teams but one box forgot

643
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:18,839
don't have work because one point guard
can't understand the law and if you

644
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,960
count food maybe should be working for
copper

645
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,640
I am another issue is the

646
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,890
less operation as a side always been
replaced by Vera

647
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:32,900
interestingly the vendors and role
falling over themselves to seoul as much

648
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,289
as bowling I hypervisors BM Saif

649
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:38,559
art nice secure file which which
virtualization we know it was for

650
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,380
virtualization

651
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,589
we put a sticker on it we haven't tested
it but you know if it doesn't please

652
00:36:42,589 --> 00:36:43,089
eisner

653
00:36:43,089 --> 00:36:46,670
on the problem is one size doesn't fit
all

654
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:49,960
on hypervisor alva all

655
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,480
on

656
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,650
p.m. safe is great if you're running
VMWare VM

657
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:57,730
a via VM safe isn't gonna work on a
super time

658
00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:02,670
that's not the point so that Tom
conducting real credible

659
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,560
admissible and demonstrable research
virtual resources

660
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,840
is a colossal pain in the ass as well
simply because it's beyond most people's

661
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,010
budgets

662
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,420
and professional access so we cite

663
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,040
running assessment applications games
virtual resources

664
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,859
is no only hard work it's virtually
impossible I tried to do and

665
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:24,859
almost got mad as a result on

666
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:28,049
an implementing protections such as they
are

667
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,720
is even more difficult pensioner may be
good or bad news depending on which side

668
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,090
of French is still

669
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,780
site to been countless virtualization
specifically

670
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,580
resource virtualization offers a law %ah

671
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:46,190
but from an attack and research
perspective it's largely uncharted

672
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,550
territory as far as a nap

673
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,590
anybody immunize bath let me know on

674
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:54,680
the bean counters are considering risk
the just considering savings and Spader

675
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,520
delivered and researchers as a size 0
looking to be unsafe

676
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,450
look and on the lice hypervisors I mean
classic example look at the

677
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:06,369
to Paul Flores I between Chris often
joiners hausky by solidify for that

678
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:07,400
always on the promise that

679
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,170
on right now one right you know when big
guy by city but hypervisors

680
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,349
don't work any by side shortstop on but
I said the research is out the need to

681
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:19,940
start thinking about where there is a
virtualization such as page mapping

682
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,310
flippin memory allocation ya todo jobs
than it was a couple took

683
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:27,759
an from a time perspective though maybe
it's time to start sharing too soon

684
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,250
there's a lot very cool stuff running
this which nobody's looking at securing

685
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:34,339
which kinda interesting I am

686
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:39,849
yep as as the old analogy goes is no
such thing as a skill system

687
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:43,060
on unless a coach Barry and nephews and
you know

688
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,700
if you going to use a system and secure
the problem is

689
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,940
if your system is in secure by design my
he's gonna get a bit biblical so

690
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,960
I think yep that's just the fans to
people that I said the

691
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,330
allow me to be here in 30 my car
employee must-haves: huh fools

692
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,390
fun suck comments questions random abuse

693
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:09,279
I will take them all ons deal with them
accordingly anyone

694
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,950
you yep

695
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,930
yeah I

696
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,399
I we don't know whether yeah

697
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,220
I'll make available that anyone else

698
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:32,760
the back

699
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,760
I cannot hear we're just saying yes

700
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,558
why yeah

701
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:49,250
yeah but the

702
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,339
the point is about BMI which is why I
kinda company of earlier

703
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:55,450
does not the lone any degree of
separation of

704
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,910
by default does the polls

705
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,589
them safe is not gonna deal with the
crucial father have actually implemented

706
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:05,400
a comp channel to allow it to work
properly

707
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,549
and they've touched on all rights fight
under my clothes down one thing buzz

708
00:40:09,549 --> 00:40:13,480
as can coach says research shows are so
many instruction point is in that

709
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,180
as a closed on one instruction point he
just got an actual so

710
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,250
to be honest and the only thing that
would actually help

711
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:27,140
is that they actually develops on proper
security devices for virtual instances

712
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:30,529
which they're not gonna day because at
the moment vendors

713
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:34,369
a running around saying okay you're
implementing virtualization we've got a

714
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:35,470
box that can do to

715
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:39,380
we've got four sixes killer which
basically is a reliable knock iraqi free

716
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:39,950
98

717
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:44,180
the National sticker on it same
virtualization ready nobody can test it

718
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,919
causes a most small vendors my

719
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,670
even most big lenders are prepared to
pay the cost of these instances so they

720
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,150
can actually test RMK

721
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:59,150
total stock the label sticker label on
and hope for the best you yep

722
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,390
okay

723
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:46,920
up first one now I'm second one probably
know

724
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:52,200
yet now notes be slightly less sleep in
our knowledge that any Microsoft advance

725
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,600
its solution largely because

726
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,980
why nom basically that

727
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,810
and is yeah but its

728
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:07,100
has anything to do with prep and it will
probably be insecure

729
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,630
okay TTP I'm one of us fold on bull

730
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:15,510
but by and large a law that colonel
design is fundamentally it's a he also

731
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,550
to carry the same tunnel design up to
the virtualized spice which they

732
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,350
probably have

733
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:23,049
is probably in secure by default discuss
%uh sorry that will not stop in Redmond

734
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,230
%uh the second question regards Suu

735
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,520
and switching on

736
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,600
options on pitted a particular chip says
yes it may

737
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,250
bull I'm not show up you can do it on
the superdome's old integrity service

738
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,440
logic is I haven't got one %ah

739
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,940
it may be to it may not be that I Donna
aside this is an idea more than anything

740
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,110
ACA

741
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:54,110
yeah that

742
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:00,700
s of

743
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,890
i think is true I think it's stronger
actual deployment instances basically

744
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:07,900
as I said earlier what you've got all is

745
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,380
a lot of organizations in love and
private and public entities

746
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:16,290
dashing towards virtualize resources
away to save cash

747
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:20,840
now one otherwise a gun aside caches a
game with a conventional network spice

748
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,810
and be getting rid of all that
conventional network resources I the

749
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:24,330
people

750
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,450
the problem is if you get rid of the
people the poll salters left

751
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,490
after the dramatic call us to manage it
all you come ons

752
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,710
in and no one person to manage
applications to manage %uh

753
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,610
to manage security can manage databases
can manage network topologies you know

754
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,840
so if corporate such the loops

755
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,860
and organizations adopting it looked at
having

756
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,120
sensible deployments which would only
did boy actual

757
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,569
sensible implementations as such just
like but Bible

758
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,170
X than you know maybe not be a solution
but they never gonna do that

759
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,000
because the vendors are set by books a
week right notice

760
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,350
your

761
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:13,350
who showed sluggish twins

762
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:21,670
yeah my word yeah

763
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,209
I don't know I have a look some yeah I'm

764
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:30,348
yeah on on like IBM I am

765
00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:34,289
page pay about the I'm not come up with
any details IBM said ok I'm

766
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:38,390
yes we recognize this might be an issue
this is why we've got acts lines are

767
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:41,808
explains that rather on the crossbar HP
have come back and said

768
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:45,130
a do it I so in asthma

769
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:52,130
and it depends how you watch the conduct
those into independent evaluations

770
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:56,400
on

771
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,000
and had indeed how independent naturally
all the problem with

772
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,330
on

773
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,509
a lot of vendors in this spice as the
other insist on

774
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:08,690
non-disclosure because of the nature so
if you've got no disclosure agreement

775
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:09,270
guess what

776
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,090
even if you find anything or even if you
find nothing you can tell me what and

777
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:15,110
you have to deal with that wonderful
wonderful legal teams

778
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:19,070
Harryman

779
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:25,080
place yep

780
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,790
all

781
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:32,570
umpire make payment not know

782
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,810
in in all seriousness and most basic

783
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:39,560
on recommendations don't believe the
band heart vans will tell you it's a key

784
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,940
all depends upon label on the size it
secure

785
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,320
tested secure anyone else

786
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,690
about that

787
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,880
I haven't looked I am Alive a few issues
but I haven't actually looked it up a

788
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,840
notch the documented some not talking
about the because I can't prove it

789
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,250
miss spews

790
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:12,790
south

791
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,270
now will pick up the gods VMware it's
not the heart

792
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,870
on it's hard if you come in it from an
Oct

793
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:23,500
if you've got of credentials is adopted
for Gina that's kinda pointless

794
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,580
and only becomes a problem when you're
looking at virtualized resources

795
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,910
which I am don't do things sensibly

796
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,000
instead of as the same setup up in a
nice network topology which can

797
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,620
understand which can grasp in which have
dealt with the years

798
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,560
virtualized environment specifically
petulant resources plus much like

799
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,110
platform

800
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:45,330
%ah you basically everything flat
because you've got

801
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:48,580
fun memory access Sosa okok ion

802
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,279
when I would be the proxy each stuff
would live

803
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,590
I don't know in a so you can't map it is
the main issue

804
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,730
and if you can not be gone assessee just
gonna run blind

805
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:06,730
anybody else

806
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:28,710
I didn't

807
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,790
yeah

808
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:37,560
that to be honest actually is gonna
increase technicians I'm in the long run

809
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:42,390
I'm does does low bullshit spoke about
virtualization if you'll excuse issue

810
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:45,009
said no you'll save time you'll save
money I'll save everything

811
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:48,330
the problem is because no bigger
actually in the Suns its implementation

812
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,870
and because you've got smaller network
teams trying to manage and secure those

813
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:54,680
net was actually increases the time they
spend on those networks

814
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,240
so you may have got reduction now and
I'd love to hear how you got reduction

815
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,830
of lawn

816
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,770
but there's a lot of instances where the
dashing around like headless chickens

817
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,280
wanna buyers for

818
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,830
Paris pression trying desperately to
understand this heap a pain

819
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:13,830
have just been London but for by the
bean counters an ulcer we don't yep

820
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,390
yeah I'm I'm now

821
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:23,500
looking a virtual ups yeah I'm more will
be forthcoming at some point I'm show

822
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,530
when I can actually

823
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,310
finds time to get out the pope and
actually do it anyone else

824
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:34,549
nope okay in that case pumps I'm done
thanks very much for your time

825

another

826
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:53,029
yep sector expertise in with their

827
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,550
virtual message you know

828
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:00,280
favorites for over night along the ship

829
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,109
fortunately she different ways
