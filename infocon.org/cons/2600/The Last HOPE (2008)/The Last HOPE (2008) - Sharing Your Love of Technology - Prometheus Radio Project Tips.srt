panel just a couple reminders all the

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:07,410
discussions you can

purchase on DVD so if you missed one
it's in the next room I couldn't decide

4
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,750
which one you want to go to

14
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,030
things like that would be greatly
appreciated

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,250
I but let's get to the next discussion
these guys

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,940
I have been in many hope conferences and
I personally support their efforts

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,769
financially

18
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,989
I as well as you should I cents

19
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:04,790
the nineties when radio stations and
radio conglomerates who had

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,720
12 stations 18 stations are suddenly
able to by every station

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,729
in town and form what are called
clusters

22
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,100
which I always add an extra word after
cluster

23
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,409
I'm radio has really taken a nosedive to

24
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:23,640
what it used to be and that is a a
mouthpiece the community

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,710
and the from EDS radio project has spent
fighting for low-power FM stations and

26
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,010
has been doing radio barn raising its

27
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,240
and have done at least eleven

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,289
but right now I love I set up radio
stations

29
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,909
in communities for communities as
opposed to

30
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,500
more crap for Clear Channel oMG this is

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,400
petri dish and Steph 99 that from me is
radio project

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,400
good morning good Saturday morning

33
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,049
I'm Stephanie this my friend Pete we
work with an organization called the

34
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,450
committee's radio project based in West
Philly

35
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,700
and it's not as Asian that helps
community group all over the world other

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,820
radio stations

37
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,189
so today we're going to talk about how
to teach technical topics

38
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:14,969
non-technical people we're gonna eat
talk about some other chicks that we've

39
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,909
learned over the years to get past those
like

40
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:20,129
googly eyes that happen when you try to
explain something he really excited

41
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:21,200
about 12:30

42
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,180
I and help how to help people get over
their fears and maybe even get a little

43
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,879
excited about technical stuff

44
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,290
so a look at a map about my background
at any UNIX nerd for about 12 years

45
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,739
a sold-out chance for a live audio
recordings have

46
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,430
like technical courses into designing
products and I didn't realize that I

47
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,389
wasn't expected to learn this on our
system in the office so

48
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:45,309
in them next thing you know the Nexus 7
and I work for the university's

49
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:48,719
up pennsylvania where I'm also working
on a master environmental studies

50
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:54,459
and um but the reason I'm here has a lot
to do with the previous radio projects

51
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:59,579
as a volunteer at a tech trainer over
the years about the hacking 02 11 makes

52
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,590
it is really big antennas to set up
studio transmitter links with farm

53
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,609
workers in Oregon

54
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:06,709
as hell to middle age women how I'm in
South Carolina

55
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,680
create their own Ethernet cables efforts
with the community center in the ghetto

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,129
love

57
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:14,840
there'll be Kenya and watched their
low-power radio station go back on the

58
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,129
air

59
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,709
after week sitting down and seem like
the trance innovation happens there

60
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:22,049
and have worked with students volunteers
who went into workshop

61
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,209
not knowing like and defense cable from
a twist tie in coming out my climbing up

62
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:26,819
the mixer

63
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:30,260
so I've been able to witness these like
a lightbulb moment so much that you

64
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,108
start to turn

65
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,620
and see that magical moment when someone
who's deathly afraid of technology

66
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,129
starts to understand it

67
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,768
that like K I edit this isn't that hard

68
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:43,260
murderer doesn't hands-on so I'm excited
to share what

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,489
but that had the things that have worked
and have worked over the years

70
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:49,559
some all

71
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:53,370
y'all are gonna have to forgive me
because I came down with them

72
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,120
some a call the other day and sell ALM
you'll just have to listen kinda closely

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,309
kid all that sultry and our

74
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:05,120
so up from EDS was started about 12
years ago

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,819
calm we so we build radio stations about
how far work is

76
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:11,989
is technical training and physically
building radio stations

77
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:16,250
and about how is trying to change the
laws that govern radio

78
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,860
and actually make that process more
clear to people to you how to

79
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,010
how to affect government how to change
%uh change the rules by which the Salt

80
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,380
Lake

81
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,950
on we have to start from the ass is a
pirate radio station

82
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,510
that I was involved with called radio
mute me home

83
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,539
there's a couple people around here that
were that were involved in radio Muni

84
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,800
it was a smallest of the station
basically came from a group of us who

85
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,060
are

86
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,200
activists who I worked in different
movements I'll

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,450
im aids in odd and housing

88
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,960
environmentalism against war and

89
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,940
but while all of us kept on coming up
against the same problem again

90
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,940
again which is we would we knew that
people cared about the issues that we

91
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,080
were talking about that there was no way
that we could break

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,169
into that up mainstream media and we
start to realize that in fact that that

93
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,850
the media

94
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,970
was owned by the very corporations in
many cases that

95
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,440
that you're opposed to and are we
figured out

96
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,750
that there was no way that we are going
to to win that game I'm

97
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,900
when they owned I the means through
which most people

98
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,360
learn about these things so the site
starter on not about that ever been on

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,320
the rate on

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,340
on the radio none of us knew anything
about radio

101
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,760
home but now we we got this

102
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,280
transmitter kit from somewhere and we
tried to solder it together and

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,790
you know we thought a written just
sharply lower upton

104
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,720
totally didn't work at all and then
we've got another one and we

105
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,400
blew that one up to you but eventually
after

106
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,160
I'm a number of tries he finally got the
like little working

107
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,070
20 watt transmitter that suddenly start
broadcasting across Philadelphia and

108
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:53,710
then

109
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,930
within a few weeks on we had

110
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,070
%ah sixty or seventy programmers look
coming on

111
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,770
from all different social movements all
different styles of music that were

112
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:04,479
never on the

113
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,670
on the rate for was out really really
thrilling up project for us

114
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,720
arm and arm

115
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,580
strangely enough odd you know I mean I
was a pirate radio station so

116
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,880
so we could very well arm you know go to
jail or get ten thousand dollar fine or

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,530
get the government confiscates

118
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,960
confiscated we ran for about a year and
a half and finally the FCC did kick down

119
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,660
the door and take take away the

120
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,770
the pair transmitter but some really
strange happened on the way without

121
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,549
which was that actually

122
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,240
that chairman of the FCC Saurabh changed
his mind about

123
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,320
about pirate radio and he

124
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:45,450
started saying before I leave office I'm
going to make sure that there is a legal

125
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,469
way for these people to do this

126
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,889
and arm so from EDS I

127
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,500
we decided well like you know someone
that powerful changes that my job to

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,010
likes or

129
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,680
someone's gotta be there to hold them
accountable so we started legal

130
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,650
organization

131
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,420
with the call upholding FCC accountable
and making the very

132
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,170
most out of this sore this this
opportunity that was created

133
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,240
on so we've been building the station's
ever since and the way that we most like

134
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,880
to build

135
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,290
radio stations is with what we call a
radio barn raising where we bring

136
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:16,930
together

137
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,880
about 150 200 people for a week and then
we have thirty or forty workshops about

138
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,040
how to wire up the mix are how to you
are connected phone pouch

139
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,970
how to set up your station governance
how to do your fundraising

140
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,280
and and everything starts out in boxes
on

141
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,320
on Friday morning and then by Sunday
it's got out just work

142
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,510
and the vast majority of people have no
experience im

143
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,469
in radio but by the end everybody has
has helped to build this radio station

144
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,800
cell so that's that but

145
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,400
when I hear talk about that actually
work what I've noticed that

146
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,720
at at hope conferences over the years is
that there are lots of people

147
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,630
there are two people here that know a
lot more about radio than I do actually

148
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,419
sell

149
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,979
the point about the for me to talk about
about on the radio engineer but I'm

150
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,370
kinda about one

151
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,510
um but appeal

152
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,980
satan saying that we probably have a lot
of nerves here who know a lot about a

153
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,060
lot of things

154
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,500
and a lot of them may have X experience
the same troubles that

155
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,820
that we've had over the years trying to
get very non technical people to

156
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,040
to to learn and am and love technology
the same way that we do

157
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,690
and so were we just have a bunch of taps
that we've generated over the air some

158
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,139
other more common sense

159
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:36,459
um some with some you may be new to you
so that's what we want to

160
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:40,089
to share with you so I want a quick shot
count

161
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:43,749
who hears ever tried to share something
really interesting to you

162
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:47,629
about a technical topic am they people
just look at you like you're from

163
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,249
fucking mars

164
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:52,790
you okay yeah I'm kinda not surprised

165
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,759
okay have you ever felt like just
totally helpless trying to explain

166
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:58,559
something like

167
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,139
how to send them email to your
grandmother like just totally

168
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:05,680
disempowered totally out of control

169
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,850
nothing I say can help this percent
everyone

170
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,240
yeah okay yet so you know funny you
should mention

171
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,459
grandmothers cuz my techno missus is my
mother ever in this country to talk a

172
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,050
lot about like farm workers and

173
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,110
journalist and activist but ok us my mom

174
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,449
I'm so it's a little frustrating but it
kind of comes our relish the challenge

175
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:29,800
is like explaining to her the difference
between a web browser and and I S key

176
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,029
so I'm so the Sony they do it with her

177
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:36,839
on this is like immediately applicable
tell a lot of us first to keep the big

178
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:37,600
picture

179
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,550
really really clearly reestablished what
is that she's trying to do

180
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,319
she describes what she wants to do and
what happens when she tries and like

181
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,430
how it like it just it doesn't

182
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,829
he goes away and so so she she describes
like

183
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,389
okay will so she doesn't need to know
like them new shit like how an MTA works

184
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,319
but she can describe your needs as a
user

185
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:02,029
I want to send an email to all my
siblings I want to print was no wires

186
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,519
I want to scan a picture and send it to
us to some people so we keep

187
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,660
we keep cytological and thank you
connecting to it through the process

188
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,230
next and let her we'd she's not don't
just smart and other ways

189
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:18,540
and this is key if you can remember that
people people are smart

190
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,889
you just have to figure out like how
they can connect with what

191
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,869
what they want to learn that'll really
get you through a lot of frustration

192
00:10:25,869 --> 00:10:30,149
so explain and not to break down the
problems she kinda understands

193
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,939
the lines between that the test is
trying to do and ask probing questions

194
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:36,410
to see what she thinks we should do next

195
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,279
and you'd be surprised how easily people
will pick up on anything kinda like

196
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:43,459
nudge them okay we're trying to do this
so what do you think comes next

197
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,399
on and nap and that way she owns the
process when she goes to try and do it

198
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,040
again

199
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,509
it's not going to be like this her
memories are gonna be like a whirlwind

200
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:51,279
of clicks

201
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,420
it's gonna be a logical process as she
can think herself through again

202
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,050
and on her attention for this has been
really really good um

203
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,279
a use and abuse analogies which is
something we're gonna go over a little

204
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,379
bit more

205
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:06,079
later on but like the wireless print
server described in terms our radio

206
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,839
so the AP is the radio station her
little while scores again for laptop

207
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,050
that's the radio receiver and she went
so far as to get out like the freezer

208
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,850
tape in sharpie and read we have on

209
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,240
for two radio station printer radio host
and it worked for her really well

210
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,550
and last ago very very slowly

211
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,930
so slowly in fact it might even come off
as condescending to someone who knows

212
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,769
what they're doing

213
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:31,309
but it doesn't come across that way to
her fortunately

214
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:35,269
and it's not certainly is not meant that
way but is really important to go slowly

215
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:37,749
enough that you can see that like both
come on

216
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:41,499
after every every like a logical chancy
don't move on until

217
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:45,309
you can see that recognition that okay
now I understand I own this part of the

218
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,319
process and then you can move on

219
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:52,300
what a sweet are message to think

220
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,929
I'll okay so when we

221
00:11:55,929 --> 00:11:58,970
started working with farmworkers I'll

222
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,429
a lot of them talked about this thing
called pop your education and I

223
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,569
I didn't know what it was so I looked it
up it turns out to be this

224
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:10,259
educational philosophy um and a set of
techniques around education developed by

225
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:13,610
um a Brazilian educator name up for our
rights

226
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,740
um and I found this quote on the
Internet I really love

227
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,420
um for for a number of reasons

228
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,569
so 30 for education

229
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:27,479
for RA implies a dialogic exchange
between teachers and students

230
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,420
where both learn both question both
reflect and both participate

231
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,059
in meaning making concretely this
pedagogy begins with the teacher

232
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,949
mingling among the community

233
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:40,079
asking questions at the people and
gathering a list of words used in their

234
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,399
daily lives

235
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,949
the teacher was to begin to understand
the social reality of the people

236
00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,160
and develop a list of quote generative
words

237
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,290
and teams which could lead to discussion
in class is for cultural circles

238
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:56,829
by making words or literacy relevant to
the lives of people

239
00:12:56,829 --> 00:13:00,279
process a conscientious is a sham could
begin

240
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,230
in which the social construction of
reality might be critically examined

241
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,100
the year 1962 you saw first experiments
and prairies method

242
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,259
when 304 markers we're taught to read
and write

243
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:14,889
in just 45 days now I think that this

244
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:18,199
is just so fuckin funny

245
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:21,879
that hot topic as grassroots as

246
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,679
um you know teaching %ah teaching
farmers to read

247
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,470
has has an incredible jargon of its own

248
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,899
a home that his %uh impenetrable like
words like conscientious is a surname

249
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,170
dialogue exchange um so it's about

250
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,350
that's cool enough itself just about
every field of human endeavor house like

251
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,709
just like him have Malta technical words

252
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,529
but the other thing that I liked about
it was was this idea

253
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:52,739
um up up the education going two ways

254
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:57,399
and arm and and the and the need for
relevance

255
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,819
and on so we were thinking about how we
could apply this to

256
00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:05,670
to teach in radio and unfortunately
there were no generative words like

257
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,459
the team decibel yaki or
electromagnetism around him

258
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:13,839
in the lives of the people working with
but we we definitely liked

259
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,199
to incorporate the idea that everyone
was learning and everyone was teaching a

260
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:17,670
mess

261
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,110
in this circumstance on okay so

262
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,470
here there's our last up some things
what one thing that we try really hard

263
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,029
to do

264
00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,079
is that if I am some key terms early

265
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,439
there is nothing stupid are then
teaching for all

266
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,459
our only to realize that half the people

267
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,769
do not know what a what is after you've
been talking about know a lot to kill a

268
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:40,589
lot some

269
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,619
group does a lot so whatever arm

270
00:14:43,619 --> 00:14:47,079
and whenever I I come across on these
words that people have

271
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,429
have trouble with I try to go back to
you its

272
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:54,069
it's really in things that people
usually experience i cum

273
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:57,499
like frequency is a good one all

274
00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:02,739
a lot of people say also I wanna I wanna
build the low-frequency radio station

275
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:06,699
he are and about you know one response
is like smack

276
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:10,050
you know it's a low-power radio station
I'll

277
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,329
but but it's actually helpful when when
you look at

278
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:17,319
at what is I'll you know where these
words come from and how they relate

279
00:15:17,319 --> 00:15:22,839
so with frequency I take to purchase all
one is like what is frequency

280
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,980
how would you use it im if we weren't
talking about radio how would you use

281
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,550
that

282
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:31,089
you know the frequency at which I pick
my nose like three times per how are you

283
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:31,379
know

284
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,699
or or whatever um and radio just happens
to be something that happens much more

285
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:36,569
frequently

286
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,839
them them pick my nose %ah you know my
life cycles per second

287
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,389
yeah all and top but

288
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,160
okay so that's what frequency years but
what we actually use it for

289
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,170
it something totally different we we
have to use frequency to distinguish

290
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,799
between just for channel so

291
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:56,980
a frequency is really more like a name
for

292
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,410
for a station that that using cell if
you if you go back to like

293
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,189
where r people might know something from

294
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:08,329
and also home but then

295
00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:11,420
talk really practically about about what
they're gonna use it for

296
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,699
that's that's really helpful

297
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:19,759
arm sue next thing we have in our list
is to use and abuse metaphor and

298
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,019
they recover metaphors analogies the
P-three's is that I

299
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,369
I really enjoyed you want the stadiums
get that one

300
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:29,369
balances start with the essay yeah it's
a large him God

301
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:34,589
so um so a I can not I could never
remember for the life of me

302
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:37,970
how to wire pin XLR cable the the ground
like %uh

303
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,189
the heart mccall to the one two and
three on the adapter thingy so I came

304
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,799
over this

305
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:46,089
just stupid memory aid so you know if
you're if you're solitary for one year

306
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,910
ground is the one goes the ground

307
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,238
and if if there's two you know I two's
company hot

308
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,790
mates is so hot where goes the two

309
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,980
and then you know trees three's a crowd
so once you have a third

310
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,079
Khan called so um that is the only way I
could remember this thing and I

311
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,120
pass it on to you as a friend of mine in
phnom in

312
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,400
enough western Kenya actually and he
took it and like

313
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,010
put this like artistic flourished on and
sorry I was like a wise man once said in

314
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,560
a kinda

315
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,629
like every every iteration up this late
retelling of this

316
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,130
memory a god-like more more artistic and
beautiful until it

317
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,470
was appreciably less stupid than how I
it started with it

318
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,209
and with there's another one when your
soldering you wanna put like the heat

319
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,530
the you save my the heat than the cider
take this on our way and take away the

320
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,120
key

321
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,180
so a technical director any gun in Kenya

322
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,660
came up you know he kind it was doing on
this is a dance so

323
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,470
during the whole trip to Kenya am used
on you he

324
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,660
cider cider he keeps others he and
people

325
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,820
um clung to this so well the body into
the trip our friends there how to rap

326
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:49,520
about this

327
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,610
in the local oMG local Nairobi so he
called Shane

328
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:55,870
it was fucking amazing gorgeous so

329
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,050
you know the stupid use enough sweets

330
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:02,800
yeah yeah it doesn't hurt to like just
make up a stupid story to

331
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,990
like if I'm trying to explain the way
that a transistor act as an amplifier

332
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,850
all just like they something like okay
like let's say that you have a bunch of

333
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,560
like corporate executives that you wanna
smash on the hat and

334
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,919
and happened out that the services of a
75-foot giant but unfortunately the

335
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,840
giant

336
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,990
is blind and deaf and um and so

337
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,080
doesn't know when to use his giant club
to smash these

338
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,780
dudes and and so what you can do is you
can put a little

339
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,139
Elf on his shoulder who can II

340
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,400
who who can here and then you just

341
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,420
send a little signal over to the Al and
elf

342
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,700
like polls on the hereof the giant and
then to

343
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,990
and then Aug you know it just goes you
know and

344
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,550
and so that that is the effect of a
transistor

345
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,870
like letting you know taking very small
signals amplifying

346
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,830
make making the much larger and I you
know you just try

347
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,909
you I could talk about collectors and
I'm matters and

348
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,380
and all that sort of thing but but
frankly I forget that whenever

349
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:10,150
I tried to talk about itself so this
feels like it's okay to be campy

350
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,560
is um it so wasn't our next point which
is put yourself in peoples mercy

351
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,149
make mistakes teach in a different
language and

352
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,770
tell people how the how you figure
things out for you don't know what the

353
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,040
hell you doing

354
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,090
a minute when you don't know something
make it clear that

355
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,040
you're not smarter than the people that
you're teaching and and do things that

356
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,639
they for use other peoples mercy

357
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,500
so that so that so that they've and it's
this that is reserved for suspect it's a

358
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,000
source of humor

359
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,890
was a good things can happen so um see
what you wanna get across that

360
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,190
you happen to know maybe that's one
thing but the notes and stuff you want

361
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,830
you wanna learn from them as well when
you do that a couple things happen not

362
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,899
only dudu

363
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,830
like actually sincerely edifying that
the person that you teaching

364
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,179
but you also said a breakdown this
teacher-student hierarchy

365
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,690
you kind of breakdown this authority
figure versus observer you eliminate

366
00:19:58,690 --> 00:19:59,360
that sounds like

367
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,530
who you're sitting up there too fancy
soldering annual

368
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,930
to be installed its the door and I'm got
there

369
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,810
a and so see you you add to the sense
that like collaborative learning

370
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:15,419
on and you know you get a you get to be
that person to the feeling that they're

371
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,110
the experts

372
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:20,460
and I'm and that if they walk out of a
seminar which other weather

373
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,590
ever feeling like they totally own this
situation

374
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,530
and you're just like some smokers have
pointed a couple things out to them

375
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,720
then that's the epic win when you look
like an idiot

376
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,940
that's the win yeah it's good

377
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,260
II I always insist on like burning like
the numbers and the colors and

378
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,720
and that's our thing and then when I
screw up it's like

379
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,190
it makes it a little bit more even like
because okay they forgot

380
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,240
you know that it's %uh MRF 240 M

381
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,700
I forgot the name for the color blue to
sorry

382
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,440
creates an object to even the score a
little bit

383
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,640
on okay another teaching track

384
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,920
do not over engage a single individual

385
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,410
whenever ideal like a class or something

386
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,930
there's always some to you in the third
row

387
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,660
that knows like way more way way more
than everyone else in the group

388
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,060
and he wants to start talking about like
what happens if you do a colocation up

389
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,320
the HD radio signals with the sell your
panel antennas and blah blah blah blah

390
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,320
and gotta be justly called on did

391
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,409
I'm totally taking out for a beer later
to talk about this but we cannot go they

392
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,950
are in this class because

393
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,280
you know this isn't between you and I
this is you know this is a

394
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,080
a group learning experience and you just
gotta um

395
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,399
not necessarily like it gauge that and
then like out

396
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,770
everybody else to now very very
important to be assertive

397
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,810
cuz when you are trying to communicate
something to a large group

398
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,110
you cap you can't just like take the one
person

399
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,000
similarly to run on that flip side to
that um it's important not to engage

400
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,040
individuals fears others a lot of times
they are people who are coming or shops

401
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,659
you

402
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,260
I'm were coming in like kinda scared to
take the touch technology

403
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,450
there's that person if you are
submissive to me it is required off to

404
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,610
the side

405
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,530
engage that person get that person to to
touch the technology get that person

406
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:23,860
um to you engaged in the process be
sympathetic to their wariness

407
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,960
understand whether where he's coming
from and respects

408
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,200
especially respect that they can to the
space to to try and get over that

409
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,440
but don't let them while 0 on the ticket
stub just gonna give more from little

410
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,090
knowledge to the next step

411
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,919
don't do it for them don't whatever the
task is don't do it for them but

412
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,820
acknowledge that it looks kinda
complicate on the surface

413
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,149
the keep them focused on the angle so
that by the end of the workshop they can

414
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,030
understand how

415
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:53,030
how awesome it feels too like figure
this thing out and get it done

416
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,850
the next see I'm so

417
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:03,910
its this is so difficult some of us have
to learn to shut up

418
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,970
it's okay to like leave some space

419
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,040
I'm we ask each we get really excited
about the things that were interested in

420
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,070
you wanna talk about every aspect of it
we talk really fast we don't stop

421
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,139
talking cuz everything so interesting
but we need

422
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,100
to learn to embrace the awkward silence

423
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,660
so it's okay it's just like put a
question out there just really let it

424
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,530
hang until it feels uncomfortable

425
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,700
because at some point somebody is gonna
venture a guess I find that

426
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,380
even quite people talk under two
conditions when they care enough

427
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,220
and when their space to speak and when
you leave that space you leave space for

428
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,520
unexpected learning and even

429
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,940
leadership stars2 stars to pop up if you
fill in every step we silence

430
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,120
that not everyone is 30 if there's not
everyone is motivated to compete for

431
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,250
space to speak so if you fill in all the
silence as you might miss

432
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,250
a great question are brilliant insight
and so to bring to try not to squashes

433
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,390
opportunities because

434
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,550
your self conscious about silence you
engender the geniuses the people around

435
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,030
you

436
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,240
and down and that way you also

437
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,710
bolsters Jason a participatory learning
so you know

438
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:12,020
it's okay to be quite some time up

439
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,450
okay and other one very common for nerds
very common for nerds to make up the

440
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,170
fallacy

441
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:20,400
up being way more accurate than
necessary

442
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,530
this isn't science its technical
education

443
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:27,129
said don't say 4.57 time to tend to the
23rd

444
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,310
cry six just say a zillion because

445
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,830
you know that's what people need to know
is a big is that small is that

446
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,280
you know that's key all

447
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,899
another one boots or somewhere that is
it doesn't some

448
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,160
it doesn't heart act sometimes I I had
this professor wants

449
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,180
do his time an older guy

450
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,190
and he was he was teaching out

451
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,500
%ah you know some basic electrical
physics and

452
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,110
he would be like okay so we've got a
buncha quantities here we've got power

453
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,730
we've got car and

454
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,890
we've got powers the style some so which
formula do we

455
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:08,930
do you think we'll will fit this like
well we could use them

456
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,390
p walls I'll by

457
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,760
a square heard I'll fuck

458
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,080
and and so everyone in the class our
minds are all like

459
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,800
people's I squirt are for fucks sake
fuck an old coot I can't believe

460
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,090
you know so like but he was making our
minds jump ahead of what he was saying

461
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,550
and I caught him kinda like acting a
little bit more

462
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:36,300
%ah %ah tottering many really was
sometimes

463
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:40,880
so its it have a good track let people
like finish their sentences and

464
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,970
you know it's it's very job often often

465
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,000
the the learning goes deeper when they
do that

466
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
um another like participatory learning

467
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,140
going trick is um there's no replacement
for hands-on stuff you know when you can

468
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,090
touch something you can look at and can
pull it apart

469
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,360
there's there's nothing there's nothing
the beach that and it also known as the

470
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,070
sense of ownership of the project

471
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,169
I wear that compressor this this review
session is mine

472
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:10,040
I you know it this this this is Mike be
resource like me use it

473
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,420
um there's nothing like getting like all
up in your technology to understand it

474
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,260
to me that link between the theoretical
on the tangible

475
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,260
and kinesthetic learning is something
that people talk about

476
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,400
when and when you can touch something
you can start to dispel the fear about

477
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,930
it

478
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,220
um the worst thing ever is like is this
feeling like if you touch the technology

479
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,770
it'll break

480
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,760
we all have days like that but the check
is to pretend that it never happens

481
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,530
you're trying to dispel

482
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,050
the you know that misconception that the
artery are you know board doesn't work

483
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:40,740
because Mercury's in retrograde at the
transmitter want to

484
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,170
because they're sunspots and the best
way to try and get past that

485
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:48,010
is to get people like like get their
hands in the transmitter get their hands

486
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,090
in the side in the got serve the
computer have your niece and nephew

487
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,170
rewire sat at

488
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,490
aside a disc inside the inside the
computer um

489
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,910
I do this adds workshops I'm called
injured audio

490
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:02,460
and the opener for that class has been
particularly successful we start with a

491
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,530
pilot cables and connectors and everyone
in the class picks one up

492
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,800
takes a back to their chair we go around
the room and identify them

493
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,470
we start this special like looking at
unlike how big is it where is it

494
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:16,490
where is it what's line richard is fit
and as I have stripes how many

495
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:20,430
and and over the course of that we
discover which you what each one

496
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,090
does where it fits why it doesn't it
what it does

497
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:28,590
and then we give it a name and when we
start out people kinda struggle with it

498
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,830
but by the end

499
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,129
people learn to speak each other's
answers to help each other out and

500
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,880
I don't have to give any input at all so
it was really really well

501
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,000
on on another one the store at I

502
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,100
I read recently %ah another

503
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,910
another person that does odd development
work

504
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:54,830
arm with and its it's about how to
finding something often kills it

505
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:59,590
what what he did was saw I wish I could
remember his name but

506
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:03,200
he job talk integrated pest management

507
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,500
got to to farmers and are developing
nations

508
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:12,150
and it was his job to basically like
educate these people all

509
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:16,880
about about how to um use different
techniques that weren't so dependent on

510
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
pesticides

511
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,390
and you know that they were very
accustomed to like people coming and was

512
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:25,390
like what the charts and like all kinds
of things

513
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:29,310
on but he tried to take a different
approach I this story

514
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,000
help to I'm Stanley is ideal a lot

515
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,410
now if someone like someone he said if
someone asks you

516
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,710
what's this bug I mean one thing you
could do is you could say

517
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:45,620
poet stopped at the Crowne pro-press I
insect us

518
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,330
while the local of well and that's the
worst possible

519
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,770
answer because just like giving it a
name

520
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,800
I in Latin is about the most useless
thing that you could do with that

521
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,970
that piece of curiosity from the person

522
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,130
home establishes that you have a great
memory

523
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:06,250
and that they didn't know it might you
dead move

524
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,420
RA for you um but what do you do and
that is like

525
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,930
and on the phone um let's take a look at
it you know how many legs does it have

526
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:19,020
where does that seem to be setting is
that one of the bugs that seems to be

527
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,410
um eating your plants is at 12 bucks it
seems to be eating on the bugs that

528
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,940
eating your plants

529
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,260
like what's what watson this bug for us

530
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,600
all and and just sorting through and
yeah eventually

531
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,770
you know after quite a bit about
servation and thought okay what you know

532
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,220
this

533
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,650
let's look in the mirror guide and see
if we can tell which one it is

534
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:43,220
and then then maybe you get to the name
I'll

535
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,540
but ot you know the real question is
email

536
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,070
are there to show off or are you there
to like actually

537
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:53,090
encourage that scientific mind set

538
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,480
that inquisitive that X exploration

539
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,520
that that they can actually I mean with

540
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,060
it does little good to like teach a set
of facts the people but if you can

541
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,139
um share our your approach love
inquisitiveness

542
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:16,140
and ham how to learn that is actually
that much much more valuable

543
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,710
so area I'll were at the uncomfortable
on

544
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,500
oh yeah okay gender and race matter

545
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,600
um now I gotta say some people

546
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,670
talk about these issues and they are
super fuckin annoying

547
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:35,940
just like self-righteous and like really
bother some and

548
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,630
yet they drive me crazy to however it is
a shame

549
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,780
because if you look at the facts
underneath

550
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:46,210
Holme you will um

551
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,580
realize like how important and how it
makes a lot of

552
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,870
otherwise incomprehensible social
situations

553
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,320
on much easier to understand and
actually improve

554
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,780
me if you look around at this room um

555
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,530
what you're seeing is %ah people who
have been

556
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,110
who courage in technology calm

557
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,380
its very different from if you just look
out

558
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,110
on the street at New York right outside
you know 18 floors below

559
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:18,260
on it's a very different set of people
now with people in this room share our

560
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,360
is have education

561
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,250
now however da master teachers who are
in however irritating education laws

562
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,240
you know that you know had some
education opportunities

563
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,350
relatively supportive families even
though everyone's family is crazy

564
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:37,410
um column and some people spend their ad
hoc

565
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,090
and probably are there was enough money
around to purchase gadgets

566
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,200
and probably had parents that didn't
smack you when you took apart the only

567
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,760
telephone in the house

568
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,030
and then nothing was was there actually
when you took apart the telephone they

569
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,200
like %ah that skew

570
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,670
now I and arm gotta make a great
engineer why these days

571
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:02,290
arm so what these things together out up
to you is what's called privilege

572
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,389
on a privilege is not necessarily a bad
thing there's

573
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,550
there's I think up there as being too
kind a privilege

574
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,930
what is the kinda privilege that nobody
should have a serve and with the big

575
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:13,639
and

576
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:18,089
and stand around fan airpower his years
a closet with two thousand pairs of

577
00:32:18,089 --> 00:32:19,009
shoes

578
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:22,469
those a privilege it does a mother
fuckers rafter you know but up

579
00:32:22,469 --> 00:32:25,889
I'll there's the other kinda privilege

580
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:29,629
is things that should be a right for
everybody education

581
00:32:29,629 --> 00:32:32,969
food on the table healthcare equal pay
for equal work

582
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:36,889
in this is but in this society some
people have these things and some people

583
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:37,539
do not

584
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,089
and race and gender are statistically
speaking committing to protect

585
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:44,658
whether people have all of these things
in lilac not individually

586
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:48,929
but statistically you know it's its its
best it's actually very very meaningful

587
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:52,070
now your privilege

588
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,678
it's not your fault it has to do with
the social structures

589
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:02,129
around but it's not your fault but it's
your responsibility

590
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:05,269
to to deal with it there's no point in
im feeling guilty about having

591
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:06,919
privileges that everyone should have

592
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:12,219
but arm what you have to do is you have
to notice when it's there are

593
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:16,119
and work to share what you have and not
ported when you're bored at then you

594
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,570
become

595
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:21,119
like really a part of the problem arm
it's also important to realize that

596
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,419
that whether are whether it's this
incredibly

597
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:29,209
honor and privilege or whether it's
whether it's not calm

598
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:33,239
it often is experienced by people that
don't have it the same way

599
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:38,859
um so home and and a very funny thing
about privileges that is very often

600
00:33:38,859 --> 00:33:42,109
totally invisible to the people that
have a arm

601
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:47,249
and are you know there's nothing more
infuriating

602
00:33:47,249 --> 00:33:49,739
you know like you're walking down the
street with your friend a friend has a

603
00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:50,709
lot more money than you

604
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:55,289
like want something to eat um they look
in a restaurant like hey let's go there

605
00:33:55,289 --> 00:33:59,589
and you like ship salish cost $25
dollars i was thinkin like

606
00:33:59,589 --> 00:34:03,200
slice a pizza or something all and

607
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,519
you just wanna smack their ass you know
because that

608
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,899
like what the fuck they thinking you
know um

609
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:14,480
and its it's not that they were like
trying to be mean to you are

610
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:17,859
are make you feel bad about yourself or
something but its its

611
00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,859
but that's how you experience and it's
not just money the same goes for

612
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,139
education and knowledge

613
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,849
it's not really socially common for
people to talk down to others about

614
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:26,480
money

615
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,659
but is very common for people to treat
each other like they are

616
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,839
their stupid because they don't have
some level of technical skill

617
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,578
on that others do and so it's really
important like

618
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:41,639
you know to to to to think about these
things and think about those dynamics

619
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,450
when you're

620
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,219
on your when you're trying to walk arm
one other thing that we always do

621
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,250
when when we're putting together our
a-bands we try our very best

622
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,289
to to balance the paddles hollom

623
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:58,900
if it's a technical topic we tried very
hard top as many women on

624
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,559
on their ass man on which I have an
appropriate mix

625
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,660
I love a I love differ races to that

626
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,670
to the to the town that were and all

627
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:13,329
and its calm if not always

628
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:17,359
easy because you know you have to like
look a little further you have to look a

629
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,380
little harder but its

630
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,250
its work that's very worthwhile and
doing um

631
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:26,559
because it breaks up the math that like
you know you might get on TV that like

632
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,890
you know on like you know technical
people are only like

633
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,779
white guys in like-for-like white coats
or something like that

634
00:35:33,779 --> 00:35:39,710
on we don't always another thing is we
don't necessarily go for the person that

635
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,170
has

636
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,819
absolutely the most knowledge we think
about whether they have the

637
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,750
communication system arm

638
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,990
skills and whether they can connect with
with the audience that they're working

639
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,529
with

640
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:52,910
and arm it you know sometimes some
people know so much about a subject that

641
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:54,799
they can't even be effective teachers

642
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:58,339
and so we really like you know think
through

643
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:01,920
a lot when one more planning are how

644
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,410
how how the race and gender how the
privilege how all those things are going

645
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,098
to play out

646
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:09,730
and you know when you do that um things
that

647
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,750
otherwise look like really confusing

648
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,710
are who are calm or puzzling they
actually

649
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,680
it's like avails been taken off and also
on you like actually I'll wait a second

650
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,029
it's it's actually a very simple problem
it's like

651
00:36:24,029 --> 00:36:28,210
its its that's how people communicate
how people are used to seeing things up

652
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:31,960
so why is the wait do talking about
gender race when

653
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,910
though woman whose foul-up brown other
dates July is to pass it back

654
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:40,770
we actually talked about that and who's
gonna take take this point we decided am

655
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,500
that that I would not do it for some
very specific reasons that than a point

656
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,690
out and

657
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:48,920
so it starts out with the fact that
honestly and

658
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,599
I don't know maybe some other ladies in
the room can relate to this but

659
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,440
just by virtue of being the owner and
operator a pair of boobs for my life

660
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,630
much was a woman in the computer field
I've been teaching gender 101 my entire

661
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,589
life and hired so you have to like
explaining clarify things but

662
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:10,359
am truthfully when men teach each other
%uh how it about how to adjust their own

663
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:11,160
sexism

664
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,480
the message comes across much more
easily much more effectively similarly

665
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,270
it's not the job for the Pakistani
British person or a Guatemalan immigrant

666
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,779
or an African American citizen to teach
me

667
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:24,390
how to treat them with fairness and
respect it's up to people with

668
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,910
privileged understand how

669
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,109
how it works and train share as much as
we can with people who deserve it just

670
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,940
as much

671
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,460
but it don't have it for something
nonsense reason and so if we wanna miss

672
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,819
you

673
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:38,109
stores around own community if we as a
community don't wanna meet shirts

674
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:42,130
that is up to us to learn the pitfalls
that can sometimes make like poor

675
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:45,170
asshole the other people who are
otherwise very well-meaning

676
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,509
so message via done

677
00:37:49,509 --> 00:37:52,589
well not dun dun some work done with the
uncomfortable right now we get back to

678
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:52,990
this

679
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:57,770
that's the fun part so the next the next
%uh popular education tip that we have

680
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,480
is on

681
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,349
don't let the techies touched tools
because the techies when they get here

682
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:03,170
early

683
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,410
would like like stuff we like to you
like to play with toys whatever

684
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,848
on but if you if you let the technical
people do all the stuff with tools

685
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:16,589
then you can at the camp take it and run
with it and you really don't want that

686
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:17,410
to happen

687
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:21,690
um so yes so so just kind of like

688
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,789
have them play you know like that game
where someone's like

689
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:29,020
teaches a man knows how to make peanut
butter jelly so like you have to give

690
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,160
instructions to the person like okay

691
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,920
open up the jar now take up the knife
into so if you can get your technical

692
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,200
people to do that with your shop
attendees

693
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,119
then you cross the boundaries you you
get the technical person to understand

694
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,619
what's difficult about using the tools

695
00:38:42,619 --> 00:38:46,230
and the the first who's participating
that's actually touch it

696
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,299
and men don't take the tools that
happens happens

697
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:54,500
this happens all the time its astounding

698
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,700
um to united to be watching at a
technical first-ever whatever and I'm

699
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,349
and come out even talk to someone you

700
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,920
who unified you're like yeah thought it
was gone pretty well

701
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,109
whatever and then like the engineer do
came over and just like rather site

702
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:07,640
owner

703
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,410
my hand and didn't like I guess I was
doing your own

704
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,399
epic fail don't do it old do it

705
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,809
and if you see someone else doing it
just slapped them

706
00:39:18,809 --> 00:39:22,599
it's okay it's okay to spot them number
one complaint

707
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,390
number one complaint are raising like
here at five times like I'm always on to

708
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,480
someone that

709
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,500
was like I was doing this thing and then
all the sudden like this guy just

710
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,599
was like now and grab the screwdriver
like

711
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,759
yeah oh man it was a with and and
they're like

712
00:39:38,759 --> 00:39:43,140
say I just felt like shit like I didn't
now I'm not gonna do this anymore

713
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,480
and sell just up up

714
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,940
I do it all the time and I have to like
stop myself

715
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:53,299
and so just like doesn't mean you're

716
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:56,380
evil person but like thank just think
about it

717
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,180
who now about about about how it feels
and

718
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:03,480
and think about when your arm

719
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,650
when you're trying to learn something
whether you're really gonna be Barnett

720
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,720
if someone else just takes it away does
it for you

721
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,299
so arm okay here's another one

722
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:18,089
sometimes the greatest learning moments
happened

723
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:22,910
when you are totally out of control and
things fall apart

724
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:26,029
um for about 10 years I worked as a
carpenter

725
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:30,619
them when a in the in the very beginning
when I was a carpenter's helper

726
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:34,460
when my boss when his plans were totally
tolley working

727
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,640
I was just stand there all day bangin
nails hang another nail bank another

728
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,279
nail

729
00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:44,220
all day long um so that was when he was
happy

730
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,910
I'll but I was learning absolutely
nothing except for bangin

731
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:52,348
more and more nails but when that I
really hard how to become a carpenter

732
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,690
it was when my when my boss when all his
plans went to shit

733
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,920
you know when all the sudden we
discovered that like

734
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,589
you know that the arm the beam that we
are planning on building this wall of

735
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:09,349
love actually it had been given away by
termites as I call

736
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:13,680
of and then we crawl under the building
and we start sawing off parts and it's

737
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,770
like oh my god I gotta get this thing I
get that new

738
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,220
then all his plans and his thought
processes became transparent to me

739
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,279
and I was like oh that's what you do you
if that am

740
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:27,380
watching him improvise so

741
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,680
um watching him improvise was where r

742
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,950
I actually understood what it would be
not to just be a male bangor but to be a

743
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,009
carpenter

744
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:38,710
and so on for that reason

745
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,880
on I really I don't over plan

746
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,690
there's one way to like look at that
house Cup having a 150 volunteers build

747
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:49,569
a radio station over the weekend

748
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:55,140
and you could think of that like like
you're a symphony orchestra conductor

749
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,160
like om here come the bile them and
that's when

750
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,989
like all about I'll keep you know it's
all the cables get install them

751
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:05,109
and here come the two bus and that's
when %ah

752
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:09,180
you know the tower goes up in and you're
just like this great conductor

753
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,680
mom I don't plan these radio station
events like dot

754
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,450
um I more like to think that them like a
dance party

755
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,559
which I actually find more fun all like
you know there's some people over here

756
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,770
dr. mass m

757
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,869
you know some people over there done
that I'll it leaves some room

758
00:42:26,869 --> 00:42:30,270
for other people to be heroes and
heroines you know to come up with the

759
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,210
thing that is going to actually make the
whole thing work

760
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:37,520
I know going in there that I've got you
know 150 people that really wanna make

761
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,829
it work I got at least

762
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,910
you know twenty or thirty tacky is that
like really know what they're doing

763
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:47,328
so you know I'll it's a real mistake to
think up like any social

764
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:50,400
human interaction like a Swiss watch
with like lots of little

765
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,410
here are some things that people are
like it's a little messier

766
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,670
way cooler to think about as a party you
know and

767
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,930
an active people are at their most
productive one when they're like that

768
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:03,940
it's kinda like provides James provides
music stuff happens

769
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,690
so a great example this honors and in
there in

770
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,509
not never be an Aggie get over early
talking to me and we had this a

771
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:14,750
with went to the workshop and you you
know we were we're so proud of myself

772
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,660
because we have these locally sourced
irons in the police force

773
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,779
equipment we brought them over and we're
gonna do out our chat

774
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:23,980
so we had to change the schedule when we
got there because there is no

775
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:25,319
electricity for the morning

776
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:29,288
this is the on didn't happen in you put
it all which is fine with it some more

777
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:32,599
and more conversation bees were shot in
the morning and then we got we got ready

778
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:32,969
to

779
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:36,700
to get setup for sighting in and
Chancery building in a in the afternoon

780
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,569
well so electricity was flowing into the
neighborhood except

781
00:43:41,569 --> 00:43:46,079
there we go no outlets no what we do is
go out and just play inside Iran

782
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,869
you know I can heat up on my arm or
something so so what did the people in

783
00:43:49,869 --> 00:43:50,920
the neighborhood do

784
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,549
but they took a light socket and just on
the Flies sounds like

785
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,739
you know sent Oscar down to the
neighbors and he came back with a couple

786
00:43:57,739 --> 00:43:58,529
of things

787
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:01,579
and all of a sudden they took the took
Aleve the took a practice like

788
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,829
live on light socket and turned into an
outlet

789
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:07,890
and that's how we sought spread out
other at ceiling

790
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,660
and leaving some forecasts leaves room
for other people to be the geniuses in

791
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,469
to teach you something the

792
00:44:13,469 --> 00:44:16,349
it just never even when it crossed my
mind to do something like that and that

793
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,049
happens

794
00:44:17,049 --> 00:44:21,150
all the time

795
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,500
help um okay so also

796
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:28,609
we've told you that we have these very
time limited situations

797
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:31,369
you know we have three days to build a
radio station and sometimes you do you

798
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,630
have to just get things done and we
cheat on

799
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,210
on our rules but if all else

800
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:41,359
fails at least leave things open to look
and ask questions

801
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,670
all you know you think about the way
people use to learn their trade how did

802
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:49,309
like an apprentice hard bro
blacksmithing usually a little kid with

803
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:50,289
guile when

804
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:54,029
you know they will carry the water and
they would like help like noble fire and

805
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:55,450
all that's our thing

806
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,489
all they would start at six an over the
years they were just get of the time

807
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:03,989
to observe how a blacksmith you know
made or shoes or whatever

808
00:45:03,989 --> 00:45:08,299
now you can't do that at a radio station
today

809
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:12,020
you know their doors are close you can't
do that my science lab today

810
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,980
and so what happens in in those places
is really invisible to the public

811
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,630
am you know it's no wonder that most
people don't really know very much about

812
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,900
it

813
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,520
so I'll so when we

814
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,219
do do these events we just make sure
that remembers that the goal is not

815
00:45:30,219 --> 00:45:30,779
really

816
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:34,020
just to build a radio station three days

817
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,869
but for everyone to walk away just start
thinking like

818
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,410
you know they look around at all the
chaos they see all these different

819
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,140
people working on different parts and
whatever

820
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,098
and and 8th at the end about someone
who's attended has never been involved

821
00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:50,289
in building rail station before

822
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:55,200
if they look and they say you know if
these jokers can build a radio station

823
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,270
like this

824
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:00,299
I can definitely go home and do a much
better job myself

825
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,349
if if we've done that then we feel like
you know

826
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:06,569
our goals stole a map we're not going to
have to go build their radio station

827
00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:10,140
I'll just call it themselves they told
you are the things they need to learn

828
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,969
so so we have just a couple minutes for
questions and stuff

829
00:46:13,969 --> 00:46:17,460
I'm thank you so much for coming and
hope you can check out the website

830
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:20,140
committee is radio project at orgy

831
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,969
I and yes so we have a government stay
questions or talk about some the

832
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:25,079
experiences that we've had

833
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,000
or 632 that you have okay fantastically
someone

834
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,079
commit Mike just

835
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,710
carries the locations at the next bar
reasons

836
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:39,559
um we don't have one Sat we have a
number for power radio stations that are

837
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:40,859
are getting ready

838
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:46,029
I'm we just how to filing window where r
um about 140 new radio stations were

839
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:47,890
applied for around the country

840
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:51,098
and I we've got about seven or eight
construction permits out about

841
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:54,839
so were thinking about scram were
thinking about missus at the

842
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,430
were thinking about organ we haven't
decided yet but we're gonna be

843
00:46:58,430 --> 00:46:59,160
announcing

844
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,000
we sent around up mailing last and died

845
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,089
you know if you sign yourself up on that
will double to keep you in touch in

846
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,410
terms of like

847
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,980
when we're building stations and and all
kinds of things

848
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,029
did it go around ever get that mailing
list around

849
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:19,270
okay get if you didn't get on it you
know will be around for a little bit

850
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:25,599
longer it's like the thought the parts
come around

851
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,839
you gotten set down you had a pirate
radio station a

852
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:32,509
how you said it lasts about a year and a
half

853
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:35,920
how does that change are they stricter
are they less strict

854
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,380
how dangerous is it to run a pirate
signal water something today

855
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,779
well it depends on your conception of
danger I mean this is the united states

856
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:44,410
and

857
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:47,420
and you know people don't get shop for
right for operating right

858
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:51,440
radio stations the way they are do in
other countries I'll

859
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,789
but they can be a considerable houseful
you know eleven thousand dollar fine

860
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:59,569
I love you know you can get your house
broken into you and your equipment taken

861
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:00,130
away

862
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:04,420
um there are a number of places where
people are still running pirate stations

863
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,489
the changes that we won were

864
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:12,489
tragic odd you know the we got a lot of
stations in small towns but we got very

865
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,329
few in the larger cities

866
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:17,609
we have a bill in congress right now
that would change that call the local

867
00:48:17,609 --> 00:48:20,680
community radioactive fallout 2008

868
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,118
sponsored by John McCain and I'll

869
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:27,460
and saw and da Maria Cantwell

870
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,230
and we've got a good shot a passing at
this year and if we do

871
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,779
than there will be column many hundreds
of more

872
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:38,069
rock me radio stations in the in the big
cities so

873
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:41,960
number breaks I doubt that if you get a
chance if you know any congress thugs

874
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,099
you know let him know you wanna see that
the past

875
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:50,579
Canada duplicative the last question
actually how was the progress on the FCC

876
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:51,660
Chairman's decision

877
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:55,368
to open up low power FM

878
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:59,799
well at the SEC's made a couple of good
decisions in the past job

879
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:03,219
%ah in the past six months or so um

880
00:49:03,219 --> 00:49:06,009
but they don't have the authority to
like open up thousands of new

881
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:06,900
frequencies

882
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,420
because congress actually took away
authority I'll

883
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,770
up from from the FCC to get out the
power stations basically because the big

884
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,349
broadcasters didn't want any more
competition

885
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:20,929
so um right now the next up is
definitely in congress a congress gets

886
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,380
back the authority it's the FCC then

887
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,089
SEC's gonna get out a lot more licenses
one thing we're really excited about

888
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:31,710
is whoever wins this this election if
it's became

889
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:36,079
or of its Brock Obama um both have
endorsed low-power radio and

890
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,089
and george bush has been opposed to it
cell I'm even if McCain wins this

891
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:40,900
election

892
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:44,609
yes we will be at war for a thousand
years

893
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:50,759
on but we'll have lots of low-power
radio stations to complain about it all

894
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:53,910
I on I'm sorry we're but

895
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:00,910
I know you we can talk later thank you
so much everyone

896
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,480
will start this Steve Stephen lady
keynote

897
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,850
momentarily stick around for this
upcoming keynote

898
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:22,120
we have the doors open all the way back

899
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,140
low back there and if you can hear me
