1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,860
gilmore game and the like on authors of
you

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,959
I O

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:15,959
dude

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,580
yeah actually whose

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,950
me this might swap India group

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,950
this actually works really well on how
to run it on

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,620
%ah because the first thing you're gonna
have to be is very very flexible

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,070
%ah in whatever your arrangements are
alright

9
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,530
so you leads we are here to hear
presentation

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,309
called starting your own time for fun
and no profit a how-to guide

11
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,610
and %ah its being

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,629
given obviously by the two of us my name
is Paul Frazier this is

13
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:57,210
my wife and business partner menus jodie
Tiger Schneider

14
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,070
and um it all started actually

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,619
I have got how we got into this whole
con organization business

16
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:09,189
and we realized when we went to Khan's
lycopene

17
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:12,520
and Freaknik enough time that the reason
we want wasn't necessarily for the

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,950
content most fit most of it which was
very good

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,350
but we went because I love the people
that we only get to see maybe twice

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,400
the year if that arm and we realize
there are

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,970
other reasons that we would have a
constant weren't explicitly

22
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,920
in the program or are meant to be there
so

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,670
when a conference call rutan that went
on

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,390
in Detroit for about five years went
defunct for a number of reasons

25
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,900
arm we kinda took it upon ourselves to
say well

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,490
what's going on in Midwest we know
there's a lot of people here that

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,110
have a real love for technology and do
incalls of so

28
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,900
what can we do to help continued the
tradition a hacker con in this area

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,720
mom and what we're gonna try to tell you
about this presentation is a little bit

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,548
about what we learn

31
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:01,170
what we did and how we started our own
Khan from the ground up with absolutely

32
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,360
no experience

33
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,799
mom to what we're doing now is I is what
we're doing perfect not

34
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,920
now I mean sure we have to cut some
corners every now and then but

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,879
overall I'm really confident happy with
that with the job we've done

36
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:17,440
are when we started our vent we only had
about a hundred twenty-five people

37
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,879
our first year %ah Nikon 1 last year
carving we had about 350 people

38
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,179
and next year at is paying between 400
450

39
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,889
now are getting any one person to
Cleveland is already

40
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,959
I'll a pretty big coup art getting

41
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,609
you know four hundred people the
Cleveland thats that's pretty damn

42
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:36,090
awesome

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,010
on so just as a brief overview of how we
restructure this presentation

44
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,209
up research arena through a lot of
questions

45
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,060
arm what we do how we do it now that are
kinda stuff

46
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,659
if you have one ob-gyn asked me to use
my phone so everybody can hear you

47
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:56,548
%ah let's get started for so if you're
running event any kind of event handler

48
00:02:56,549 --> 00:02:57,239
and whatnot

49
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,400
you have to think about why are you
doing this in the first place

50
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,079
for us is pretty easy we saw a need that
was there a vacuum that we decided to

51
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:04,560
fill

52
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,499
mom however you know there there could
be many reasons for what it is you want

53
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:09,900
to do

54
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,099
in only along that if you have the

55
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,400
what what you decide what the purpose
your event is for ours it was

56
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,120
creating event where we can celebrate
community creativity technology

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,760
once you have it on your figure out what
are people gonna do

58
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,668
when they're actually airbag are they
just gonna sit around in that room

59
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:31,909
are talk around boarding up for and then
throwing it on

60
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,138
you know drift net I'm what's fun been
there done that but

61
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:38,439
you know are that's has won the many
things you could do and here's

62
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,698
I'll listed are for major areas that a
lot of times

63
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,299
usually have ya suffered somewhat the
link to the event is

64
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:49,049
are real popular ones obviously is %uh
the weekend you know Friday Saturday

65
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:49,680
Sunday

66
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,329
are the most tech const follow on
there's been

67
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,419
other events that have tried to kinda
change it up in maybe go during the week

68
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:58,230
and why not

69
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:01,319
I and that can work but it all depends
on your audience

70
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,959
I ya step aside if it's gonna run 24/7
are

71
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,239
like up like most tactic on still some
other things you have to

72
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,629
think about are reasonable attends
expectations when we first started

73
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,779
running times

74
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,969
up I have to admit though the first time
I ran outta con

75
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,699
we are going through our first then you
and I was walking around in awe

76
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,480
thinking that we're gonna 500 people in
this venue

77
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,810
the very first year and we're going to a
fantastically great job

78
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,870
and bring in all these people and up

79
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,960
that dessus de didn't necessarily camp

80
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,378
so you have to be realistic about what
it is you expect

81
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,970
arm as we learn later having about 225
250 people are first-year

82
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,830
was fantastic it was more than def can
have their first year

83
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,250
our national theater Somersworth the
first hole I was like

84
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,560
59 arm I tried to go trust me

85
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,979
arm but usually new const art of small
because you have a lot

86
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,360
to sell people you have no brand you
have no history people know what is your

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,060
about

88
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,319
if they're gonna waste you know nine
hundred thousand dollars to come to the

89
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,139
city

90
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,009
to either be bored to tears for to learn
something really cool

91
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:18,860
and you also have to figure out if
you're going to try to talk mostly

92
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,930
locals

93
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,860
are mostly people from outside the area
mom sense

94
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,979
are that is basically one I figured you
know this to be a great way to get

95
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:31,870
people locally clean area Northeast Ohio
Columbus Toledo Youngstown

96
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,110
as it turns out eighty-five percent of
people coming out on our

97
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,479
not in the state of Ohio at all or
outside of

98
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,628
r radius of like about an hour and a
half so much for people that have

99
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:43,030
knock-on come from

100
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,599
about thirty five different states
usually about three or four different

101
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,819
foreign countries

102
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,689
%ah and that's something that surprises
but you want to think a little bit about

103
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,460
what it is are you know who it is your
tracking

104
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,568
time where Bob Bob venues

105
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:01,610
arm the venue

106
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,689
where you can hold this thing

107
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:09,620
at first it seems like a really easy
question go to a hotel

108
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,439
or are some public space and say hey i'd
like to rent your space for X number

109
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,379
days

110
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:17,900
to run an event most the time

111
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,900
you know if you just going with that
approach up

112
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,490
your gonna be doing so kinda a
disservice on it because you have to

113
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,360
think of as a work event you mean you
need something like

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,280
a comp a large conference hall a
conference center do you need simply a

115
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,409
couple rooms

116
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,310
are for board meetings at a smaller
hotel if you're only gonna have maybe

117
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,340
thirty or forty people from the party

118
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,599
on are you gonna run an outdoor event
all the key camping event

119
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:47,240
are %ah CCC for example is a good
example around that outdoors

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,729
kinda some like that so you have to come
to figure out

121
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:55,050
what venue would really best support
what it is you trying to do also

122
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,620
and this is where the words I love you's
most hacker cons usually tend to be

123
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,930
hotels that have just a hint of quality

124
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:05,129
and what I mean by that is they're not
for five star hotels

125
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,249
but they're not absolute tops I've been
the concert tops

126
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:11,810
they can be a lot of line but chances
are there's gonna be enough problems

127
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,319
there

128
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,490
that its gonna kinda ruined a good time
what you want to do is focus on venues

129
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,199
that have youth that obviously have
managers and people that run it that

130
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,060
care

131
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,270
but the date that don't care enough
about what it is you're going to do to

132
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,008
it

133
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:29,449
bomb so you have to think about that and
likewise you have to think about what

134
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,469
your local resources are

135
00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:34,699
I'm here being at hope is a good example
having a lotta resources

136
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,240
you know there's plenty places to eat
you can get here via subway

137
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,289
you know much different airports arm
there's

138
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,509
no not that there's never lack first
things to do

139
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,650
arm one free tick I want to once and

140
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,249
II love fitness as a con- up was a
really don't be hotel

141
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:55,389
up there was absolutely nothing to even
walking distance

142
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:58,639
which since before wanna planning to get
ready didn't get around car

143
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,909
was really difficult so we actually
ended up having a charter taxi

144
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:05,090
ways to combine our have to calm to go
to a grocery store

145
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:08,529
the spaniel 50-60 bucks on cold cuts
take back to hotel room

146
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,860
that we had to keep a nice because there
were no women fridges right so

147
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,360
that for you you know that made a pretty
miserable time I had I know the kind I

148
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,749
think I had a timeout with

149
00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:20,210
you know gonna do it knowing om alright
this to be kinda ghetto

150
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,810
I kinda you're very very DIY arm

151
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,879
opera Paris such and the other thing
about venues is how do I deal with

152
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,689
potential funny when I say to: I mean

153
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,580
initially contact them and explain to
them what it is you're going to do

154
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,039
there's a large temptation when you
gonna start in the van especially kak

155
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,229
kinda go in and not tell them that you
are in fact

156
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,780
a hacker con I'll when I want to talk to
our first venue

157
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,949
about what it is we wanted to do I
explicitly stated I said work

158
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,200
what we're gonna do is bring in about
250 R

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,470
some the smartest people in the entire
world you may know them as hackers

160
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,420
what you know is probably not you know
not

161
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,930
realistic what you're gonna find is
people are very smart

162
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,280
little eccentric probably gonna have
Mohawks blue hair

163
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,390
studded leather jackets you know they're
gonna look strange but they're gonna be

164
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,890
good people

165
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:18,460
you're gonna find out the groom's you
know furniture any rooms

166
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,840
will be reorganized are there will be
lots have

167
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,110
a home decor going on of beds will not
be put together properly there will

168
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,860
probably be lots of trash

169
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,270
and there's probably going to be some
noise and excessive amounts drinking

170
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,960
to which I after sitting down with a
plight little old lady at the other end

171
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,350
the counter talk about then use yasser

172
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,550
we're the closest hotel to Brown Stadium

173
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,850
if you've never been to a Browns game or
any other fucking

174
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,030
you know that these guys coming you're
already drunk not only that but we also

175
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,939
have the cleaving Policeman's Ball

176
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,920
have you ever tried live two 500-pound
man up in elevator

177
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,920
while he's throwing up on you I think
you kids will be just fine

178
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,240
thanks to that end up we've met with you

179
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,890
previously where they venue for five
years the each your ass is back they

180
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,180
wanted us back this year

181
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,960
but for various reasons we need more
space and up

182
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:21,960
better proximity to things like food mom
so we changed it up

183
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,080
alright you have to next consider

184
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,390
mmm now your order okay what you have to
say about who your average attendance

185
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,030
try to get the mind the people to come
to your fat

186
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,920
you have to think about what their
expectations are what their needs are

187
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,839
what you

188
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,960
what kinds of things are they going to
want mom

189
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,340
and likewise have to keep an eye on your
prisoners I'll

190
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,170
are they can expect free airfare and
hotel accommodations

191
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,300
is it gonna be great that they just get
in for free um

192
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,450
there's a calm that I won't mention the
name of but actually expect the

193
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,090
presenters do three presentations

194
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,940
and %ah still manage to pay almost full
price ticket yet

195
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,040
that's their decision I think it's kinda
ghetto but you know it seems to work for

196
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,040
them and they seem to pull about 1500
people in here

197
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,849
mom when you think about conferences a
lot of people that have 90 hacker

198
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,970
conference

199
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:18,010
think I've conferences in terms of
technological conferences for medical

200
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:18,910
conferences

201
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:22,230
in which certain people will you know
people will pay twenty-five hundred

202
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,650
dollars five thousand dollars to come
and

203
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,829
get everything covered meals hotel
transportation all these details covered

204
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,910
for them

205
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,110
arm so a lot of people that you know

206
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,130
think about running conferences or a lot
of venues that

207
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,760
have done conferences before might not
understand

208
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,300
how things are done with hacker
conferences or with conferences that are

209
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,400
arm heavily sponsored or you know that
have huge budgets

210
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,730
on and likewise when your concern
presenters are you want to try to remind

211
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,120
your prisoners that

212
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,870
you're not in this for novel or money
and that you don't have

213
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,100
you know a six-figure budget no you may
mom

214
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,500
but that you know that your resources
limited and that will try to do for them

215
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,680
as much as you can

216
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,980
but what is it that they need out one of
our policies

217
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,780
nada con as are asking ourselves what is
the return on investment on the speaker

218
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,050
if ur gonna spend seven hundred dollars
and 300,000 hotel room

219
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,460
is that person gonna bring in
potentially X number of people is this

220
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,100
person the big enough for all

221
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,800
arm because eventually everybody will
try to ask can I get in for free

222
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,030
we'll deal with that in just one second

223
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,030
legal and tax stuff sure please

224
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,490
alright so when we decided to found on a
con

225
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,590
one of the first things we did was look
at things like

226
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:43,440
incorporating under limited liability
corporation because we didn't want to

227
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,160
lose

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,310
our belongings if the thing failed or
something very bad happened at the hotel

229
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,300
um one other things you really should
consider though is the nonprofit

230
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,020
because a the differences that we've run
into

231
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,900
with the corporation versus a nonprofit
is that it's very difficult to get

232
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:08,310
good sponsorships because you can't take
donations it has to be

233
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:11,410
a sponsorship so we return like

234
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:15,719
ad revenue or whatever for the money
that they give us

235
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,490
to a nonprofit people can actually Dhoni
and sometimes

236
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,160
easier to get large corporations to give
money to a nonprofit

237
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,829
um make sure that you apply for all
necessary federal and state tax ID's

238
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,360
if you do not pay your taxes they will
probably find out at some point

239
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,480
especially if you start making money

240
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,870
and if you aren't making money they
don't text you very heavily on its looks

241
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,370
pretty good too

242
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,130
arm make sure you know what is taxable
and how much you will be taxed

243
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,660
are currently was not a con because we
are inside the city of Cleveland

244
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,089
we pay the federal we pay the state

245
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,110
we pay the city were incorporated in we
pay

246
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,240
sales tax and we pay an extra tax on
registrations inside the city of

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,500
Cleveland

248
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,920
that could hurt when we found out about
it it almost made is moving to the

249
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,180
suburbs in place it's like 15 and a half
percent of all over ticket sales go

250
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,540
directly to taxes

251
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,699
yeah its we basically get double text on
every single registration will take in

252
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,460
and we have to account for that when we
set registration prices

253
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,230
keep separate financial accounts and
credit cards

254
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,640
it's much easier to keep everything
separate if you just keep it separate

255
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,680
when you're doing budgeting when your
file your taxes

256
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,970
just keep track of everything cover your
butt and yeah

257
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,490
out that's one thing we didn't do
originally I just kinda financed

258
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,540
everything on the Capital One card

259
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:41,079
and the chase card and then the MBNA
card

260
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,570
and %ah once you get up to about twenty
thousand dollars

261
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:49,520
your it a point to figure out well %ah
it would be really nice to be able these

262
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,199
right of all this interest

263
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,540
incentive eating it by adding a separate
company credit card it makes it really

264
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,010
easy to say okay he's a copy expenses

265
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,730
company interest that are paying on this
hence I can write this off

266
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,720
up licenses up not not only in terms of
ticket tax if Cleveland

267
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,620
you technically need what on site you to
you

268
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,690
me a lease in our city you need a
license to sell tickets for events

269
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,780
%uh this is something I did know about
until about your three

270
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,819
up most the time series are pretty lax
about this

271
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,170
and you might be really tempted to say
why I don't wanna drop 7 a half percent

272
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:29,130
however the thing is if something
happens in New need to call the police

273
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,820
you know somebody doing something really
nasty in events happening which

274
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,540
you need help it's really nice to say
%ah

275
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,839
you know hi are you know poss nighter
whatever we run this event

276
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,440
run file with the city were running this
event could you send some help

277
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,800
arm because we're the worst things that
could happen is that they find out about

278
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,260
you for something really bad

279
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,780
and the notice you don't have all your
ducks in a row with paperwork

280
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,880
are state I D filing all that are kinda
stuff on because the fees

281
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,480
really do are at up after a while I
forgot to pay for example

282
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,240
are sales tax %ah for about a year

283
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,730
and about five hundred dollars in fees
later on about four hundred dollars a

284
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,250
of tax I i decided i probably just

285
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,930
pay the taxes on time

286
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,800
leadership ahh organization

287
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,920
as they've been saying something the
hackerspace in stocks um

288
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,190
you kind of need to have eight core
group

289
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,880
together before you try to take on a
venture like this

290
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,460
at least to people in charge we started
out with

291
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,260
three when we founded the company and
our third person since has moved on to

292
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,030
other things

293
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,680
good you have to have a nice quantity of
people

294
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,740
who can get along cuz if you have too
many people trying to start it then

295
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,960
everybody's gonna fight

296
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,790
over what the visions going to be what
direction you're going to take

297
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,180
if you have a nice small close group you
can kind of work it out internally

298
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,490
and then kinda expand your staff later
once you

299
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:04,049
have an idea of where you're going um
same thing for volunteers

300
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:07,829
if everybody is a volunteer then

301
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,158
you know who's paying everything if you
decide what your voters and free

302
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,309
everybody's going to want to volunteer

303
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,389
but then you've got all these people to
control enough jobs to do

304
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,620
see me to get that right number of
people

305
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,089
to kind of handle all the problems and
deal with things without having too many

306
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:27,389
or without having everybody getting
overwhelmed because you have enough

307
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,230
people

308
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,500
make sure to separate out the duties and
responsibilities

309
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,120
build some sort of management structure
how we've kind of gone with a little bit

310
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,300
of another

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,899
authoritarian process I like to call it
a benevolent dictatorship

312
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,200
but we do have our core staff members

313
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,410
where we have people were really good at
networking so we tell them okay

314
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,870
make the network happen we have people
who are really good AB

315
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,430
we sell them to make the AV happen and
we step back from it

316
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,340
but overall we are the ones responsible
for the big picture and dealing with

317
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,040
finances and other things that kind of
have to be held within the

318
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,010
actual corporation

319
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,010
on up personalities

320
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,480
you likely run into people that have
very

321
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,430
actual intentions arm

322
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,310
but for whatever reason you know they
just might have personality clashes with

323
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,330
other people

324
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,790
in the organization other might have
been words Spokane

325
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,560
I'm thinkin want protection pretty
particular frost where

326
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,120
somebody told somebody else that was
voluntary for Nikon

327
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,310
something in a way that was rather harsh
they got upset said well

328
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:45,330
fuck you guys I'm just leaving arm

329
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,449
and thats you know is somebody who's
who's organizing and wasn't party to

330
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:49,690
that communication

331
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:52,610
as a quote that you know that really
sucks I'm sorry that you had that

332
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,710
experience

333
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,460
and later on to find out it was just you
know it was a simple miscommunication

334
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,150
but

335
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,940
at this point you know any its kinda
every its kinda irreparable

336
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:05,210
but you have to recognize the gonna be
many different personalities and you

337
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,350
want a lot a strong personalities and
strong-willed individuals and people

338
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,700
that will get stuff done

339
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,640
on your staff and you have to respect
him for that

340
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,100
one other thing who were the worst
things you could do is just ignore

341
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,650
somebody's contributions

342
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,340
were not at the signal IJ that they have
the experience they do

343
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,300
arm some time you're in our in
organization so we will do something

344
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,060
that my I might not agree with her think
is the best way to do things

345
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,590
but you have to kinda think about it and
in fight

346
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,050
neophyte the bells you should be
fighting not you're not all of them

347
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,870
you have to decide how big a deal is
this arm a good example at the

348
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,580
hackerspace is talk was the

349
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,899
the bike shed you know how some
organization will

350
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,170
decided me the right of bed aboard to
build an atomic power plant

351
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,490
but if you want to design a bike shed
everybody his brother has to prove his

352
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,630
contributions

353
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:57,040
and it turns into a be through our
discussion over what what color is gonna

354
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,940
be looking at bikes we put in there

355
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,150
om and getting lost in the details I'll

356
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,250
which is another thing that happened
concept to deal with a lot of other

357
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,430
Const on

358
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,770
on Pakistan to be very very
detail-oriented

359
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:13,220
very om interested and trying to make
sure

360
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,410
every things the right way everything's
the way it should be maybe even a lil

361
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,720
bit OCD

362
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,840
and when you're designing a network
that's a great thing to do

363
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,199
if you're trying to make sure the treaty
cables are arranged properly that's a

364
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,500
excellent thing to have if you're trying
to organize fifteen different major

365
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,270
topics

366
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,260
that's terrible because you're gonna in
invariably you know

367
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,970
spendin spent a lot of time at three of
them and then ignore the other 12 months

368
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,700
so if you decide to be like a head
organizer such an event

369
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,450
try to step back as much as possible but
still keep your fingers in the pie

370
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,370
money all money money money money

371
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,420
as paul said the first year we were
thinking that we might

372
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,990
you know randomly sellout this hotel
surprisingly totally through

373
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,690
word-of-mouth advertising we were just
completely blow the books rate

374
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,160
and instead we ended up with like a 125
people

375
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,809
so when your budgeting be realistic
about how many people you actually

376
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,879
expect to come through the door

377
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,230
don't imagine that you're going to fill
the space the first time

378
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,800
unless you have a lot of really good
friends with a lot of money

379
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,940
um budget your expenses for the entire
year

380
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,710
think about things like web hosting
where you're going to put things

381
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:29,150
over the course the year storage I know
it is a big one

382
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,460
I anything that you might need to pay
for over the course of the year

383
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,370
I we've ended up buying projectors and
other sorts of things that we've had the

384
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,770
budget for

385
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,980
are make sure you budget for Texas the
taxes will come out

386
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,210
and if you're totally on the local
probably gonna be a fair bit of money

387
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,220
make sure you don't like set your
registration solo

388
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,680
that you are going to be able to pay out
those taxes and

389
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,740
again any licenses fees anything you
have to take care of make sure you have

390
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,220
that

391
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,710
setup right up front itemize your
expenses

392
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:08,380
it'll pay off when you do your taxes
make sure you keep track of everything

393
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,740
you expend I make sure you keep track of
everything that comes into

394
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,570
texts preparers really like to have all
that in detail

395
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,950
when you're setting your ticket price
make sure your taking into account all

396
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:23,530
the different fees and things that
you're going to have to spend on

397
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:27,180
because like we figured out that it's
about sixty five dollars a person to run

398
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,450
out a gun and then we set the whole
walk-up registrations a fifty dollars

399
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,600
apiece

400
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,790
that doesn't pay for itself sizzling

401
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,530
not that's when I was on C and levels
and types of sponsorship

402
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,870
if you're going to be seeking out
sponsorship because I'm sure most of us

403
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,500
are not self-made millionaires

404
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,050
expanding our own bags um

405
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:52,330
set some sort of guidelines on who
you're going to approach

406
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:56,620
what sort of money you need to bring in
to make ends meet

407
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,670
and what types of things are going to be
sponsor vol

408
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,700
we have things like get your name on a
badge did your name on the lanyards

409
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,330
ads in the booklet banners put over the
registration table

410
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,770
we've itemized out all these different
things that could have

411
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:18,639
someone else's logo put on them without
taking over the conference

412
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,190
yeah corporate learning or complete the
Iomega sorry can attest on that

413
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,220
%uh but the main thing is you know do
you want to be

414
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,410
such-and-such conference sponsored by
Microsoft

415
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:35,140
or do you want to stand on your own and
then have kind of minor sponsorships

416
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,720
that just help over the cost
registration

417
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
but don't completely take over do you
want to have a trade show where people

418
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,780
are talking about their products for you
want to have a whole bunch of creative

419
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,090
individuals from colleges talking

420
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,770
and just have you know a banner in the
background for recruiting company

421
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,100
um talk about

422
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,580
this is still an area that we're working
out let's put it that way

423
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,760
om our ability to sponsorship has been
really a challenge as I said as she said

424
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,590
because up

425
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,290
so as we are a nonprofit I'm so it's
been kinda hard sell

426
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:14,889
but when you're trying to think about
sponsorships you can you have to put

427
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,429
your

428
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:18,940
yourself in the shoes I love up the
person you're corny and you want to know

429
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,440
what it is they want in return for you
for

430
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,030
their money because essentially they're
buying something from you

431
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:28,160
and what they're buying is either
exposure or

432
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,179
up what basically adjust its exposure
most the time

433
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,160
arm and you have to make sure that they
understand what kind of exposure they're

434
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,910
getting

435
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:39,650
because if you tell them well our vents
going to have a former people

436
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,820
they're thinking while that's not you
know that's

437
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,850
I have a lot of people but if you say
Weber have of order people between the

438
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,360
ages about

439
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,460
1835 all the other high-tech sector
workers for the most part

440
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:55,000
very creative bomb if not there in
college

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,990
and will soon be in the workforce is
this the kinda people you're interested

442
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,450
in

443
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,670
to was a lot of a might say well that is
pretty interesting

444
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,820
I'm one of the sponsors actually find us
last year was a local

445
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,220
technical recruiting company and they
said you know this would be a great way

446
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,330
for us to get our name out

447
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:13,110
I said I haven't even heard a few and
you seem to be a pretty big company in

448
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,470
the Cleveland area that does

449
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,150
tactic for critic so you know they had a
very good opportunity there

450
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:22,280
yet they still had enough understanding
of what we did to say you know

451
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,649
all we want is our name there we don't
know don't have to promote it too bad

452
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,370
you have to say sponsored by such and
such too much

453
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,660
just you know make sure that were seen
the people know we exist

454
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,380
so trying to anticipate what it is
sponsors potentially one

455
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,690
if you want to go the complete DIY route
I just have a completely self-funded

456
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,710
self-financed you can do it first year
that's how we did not a con

457
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,970
om credit cards up

458
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:50,620
borrowing money from friends backing %ah
we did

459
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,620
you can do it Rd the budget for first
nada con was only about ten thousand

460
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,550
dollars

461
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,230
her about and another thing we've run
into

462
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:03,559
is that a lot of sponsors would rather
give you product than money

463
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:08,920
yes so we headin overwhelming quantity
oval Riley books

464
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,429
Flyers things that we couldn't get rid
of I think we had three hundred you

465
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:15,250
going two discs for 150 participants

466
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,800
so figure out what it is they want to
give you

467
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,860
and then decide if you really need that
and

468
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,020
the others kind of a break-even point on
that because

469
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,520
it gives us things to give away to
people we can give out prizes overall

470
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,500
Riley books in whatever

471
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,080
but at the same time when what we really
need it was money maybe we should be

472
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:40,939
looking elsewhere

473
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,120
all right let's try to close this a
looker handling money

474
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,770
I'm one of the biggest things to
consider when running about is how you

475
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,940
can accept payment

476
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,520
our Pay Pal obvious is a very popular
option but for a lot of reasons people

477
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,590
the one user privacy concerns

478
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,429
or or other concerns are they simply
don't have a bank account or credit card

479
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:01,950
mom we take up for what we do we
actually take a whole number of

480
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,100
different ways we handle

481
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,809
credit cards directly wherever on
merchant account but you can apply for

482
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:10,340
it's cheap are you can get joker card
terminal which we've haven't bring two

483
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,210
events

484
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,570
%ah we also accept cash at the door arm

485
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,840
and checks you know in the mail 10
things you obviously want to avoid is

486
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,340
getting checks at the door

487
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,350
because if it doesn't clear you're
screwed arm

488
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,990
we usually don't have too many problems
with like chargebacks right thing like

489
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,750
that

490
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:31,880
are mostly because you know if it is up
in person we try to make sure we get

491
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,220
a signed receipt slept or you know get
your CV to

492
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,370
arm or even the authorize ought not know
how to live that

493
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,920
arm but you want to think about what the
costs are because obviously if you start

494
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,190
taking papon credit cards

495
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,450
here to take yet another hit up you know
23 percent whatever

496
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,940
on that money that you're gonna lose arm
in that process

497
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,500
because a lot of people tend to think
why a personal PayPal account they're

498
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,640
not taking my money

499
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,549
so I just pay pal you and I'll be like
you know that's great especially

500
00:27:58,549 --> 00:28:00,270
sponsors one sponsor said

501
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:04,400
well we just sent you 1500 hours a pay
pal I like your where only get like

502
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,780
1425 in at or whatever you're basically
from whites only five dollars and like

503
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,250
all

504
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:12,250
I didn't know that others cut you a
check instead arm

505
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,559
so if you can you know get the full
value of what it is you want

506
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:19,720
go for it I and again as we kinda
touched upon mom

507
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,299
who pays are it not come out we have a
policy

508
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,340
where core staff as we call them don't
pay

509
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,240
most them end up doing so anyways I just
because they believe in the event what

510
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,200
we're doing

511
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,040
mom likewise volunteers you pay we don't
make present we don't make presenters

512
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,879
paid off

513
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,000
and mike was waived a pastor Zak is
actually offered

514
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,450
our presenters to bring a guest for free
arm events like Def Con

515
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:45,910
you know have their honorary about what
three hundred dollars and or

516
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,309
for for badges or something like that
arm and neck in work

517
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:52,610
you know that could work in your favor
but it's kinda difficult are

518
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:56,730
especially the beginning om to decide
who's paying in who's not because you

519
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,600
don't want to hurt anybody's feelings

520
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,740
are one good way to do it might be the
hackerspace smiling to say what

521
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,480
everybody has a thorn in the city

522
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,840
we're all in this together I'm to make
this thing happen

523
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,400
are we didn't do that simply because we
knew we were going to begin a sweat

524
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,740
equity firm everybody

525
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,620
that you know it will be worth taking
people's money or forcing them to pay

526
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,400
not just to get in and also we make sure
that our staff

527
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:25,020
are pretty much working with this year
round some up them obviously

528
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,000
a certain job certain tasks are more
done like within the couple months

529
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,929
before

530
00:29:29,929 --> 00:29:33,410
but if you are on our core staff we know
how hard you're working

531
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,490
and that's why we don't bother to make
them K

532
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,700
whereas volunteers I mean if you tell
the person to get in free if they

533
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,870
volunteer

534
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:45,429
well do you make them pay and then try
to refund at the end f you confirm that

535
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:48,630
the actually worked or do you do it all
on blind trust

536
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,480
you only let your friends volunteers
that you know they'll actually help you

537
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,900
out

538
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:55,230
it's just kinda really talking to is it
gets really nasty

539
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:58,920
I'm so having a consistent policy works
likewise you wanna policy for refunds

540
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,470
and pop

541
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,570
and transfers because invariably
somebody will register in July for your

542
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,809
event in April

543
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:07,040
and I'll decide in March that they have
a new job and they can't calm

544
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,470
they want their money back I'll we at
reports that we personally have a policy

545
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:13,059
of no refunds

546
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:17,170
however will allow you to Sri sell that
registration or take it anybody else you

547
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:17,870
wanna

548
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,970
and leaving make sure that it's register
that new persons name

549
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:25,010
and what not so that mom it could be
known as theirs

550
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,280
it's a lot easier to reassign deter them
to send money back

551
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,030
yeah and also then you don't have to to
to give that money up cuz

552
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,350
if you're running about chances are if
you get money in your it'll be spent

553
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,250
right away

554
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,690
om that's why a lot of events including
ours do up

555
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,840
are bright registration system before
the event because most of our costs

556
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,890
actually happened before it costs a lot
of money to do all the things we do to

557
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,780
Nikon

558
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,460
arm so you know what if we can get that
money in sooner it means we can

559
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,530
plan faster and save money yeah

560
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,920
mom there's four cornerstones a running
account for big things you have to think

561
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,870
about

562
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,559
registration what it is you're doing
your van

563
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:08,040
how to promote that event and although
the the logistics and security comes

564
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,870
concerns to think about so those are for
overarching a reserve account

565
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,150
group had touched upon in the next few
slides arm just kinda keep in mind when

566
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,630
thing about how to actually run the
event

567
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,240
bomb in one other mention a I shoulda
put your money

568
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:26,900
is branding arm what

569
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,000
what a lot of good hacker kinds
especially hoping def kinda been

570
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,660
are good at doing is creating a brand
there are certain funds in certain

571
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,970
images and other things

572
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,330
that you see in which you are you
immediately think all

573
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,699
that's tough time that's whole that's
black cat

574
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,250
mom just like any other product you want
to try to define yourself by something

575
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,590
for us that's actually been a couple of
months that we've chosen

576
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:55,480
are we have of a logo %uh that we use
and we now have a up kind above

577
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,790
credo of sort of creativity community a
test and technology

578
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:03,730
those three words kinda Phineas and it
helps us explain to people what it is

579
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,340
we're trying to do

580
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,660
Bob and likewise it helps if you have a
good good graphic designer to kinda

581
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,140
design a look for yourself

582
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,340
arm as you can see we can I have this on
14 thank you thing going on

583
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,429
which we brought in in part because we
also are run a double party

584
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:22,760
called block party well we don't run it
by Jason Scott ramen for massive do

585
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,890
I in conjunction with ali khan are but
you wanna make sure the programming has

586
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:27,510
a place

587
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,250
in your van up here's just a short
checklist of items

588
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,140
just to think about when you're running
event a lot of these you might not have

589
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:34,919
thought about

590
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:39,520
at first like AV needs like uni plasma
screens you need projectors

591
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,400
uni projection screens I do you need
audio mixers how many actual our cables

592
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,620
you need how many PA system speakers do
you need

593
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,860
you need speaker stands how you gonna
pay for it all

594
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,860
mom if ross we actually a very sweet
deal

595
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,309
where we have a now well we'll talk
about the event

596
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,918
mom but we have a pretty good deal with
that up like this content recording and

597
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,840
archiving for us it's really important
that what we do at the event

598
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,590
is kept alive and doesn't and once the
event's over

599
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,100
are we've had the the privilege of
working with had who's been running

600
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,190
around actually

601
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,919
recording these events and his bob
Bennett great resource to actually

602
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,840
just DVD's right after the event that we
can ripping code input on line

603
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,919
so having that dealt with is our you
know a really big

604
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,049
problem to solve are we tried to get
ourselves

605
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,629
in your to image it was a complete
disaster because

606
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,730
doll logistics have actually running
multiple video recorders

607
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:35,230
keeping the data making sure doesn't get
destroyed I'm making sure that

608
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:36,450
everybody's in frame

609
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,890
can be a real pain in the ass real quick

610
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,440
arm along with that again photographers
and historians

611
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,410
we actually had about three or four arm
different photographers running around

612
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,220
the event

613
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,370
bomb with just a main purpose of taking
pictures of everything that's going on

614
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:56,970
now have a kind of people a lot people
might think well now that's a little bit

615
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,630
weird

616
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,350
what if this teenage in any Haqqani or
anything resembling hacker con

617
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:05,210
you really have no expectation of
privacy

618
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,899
if you're in a public space for 1500
people arm

619
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,949
obviously Rd you know we have a policy
though obviously if you got to some

620
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,379
music please don't take my picture

621
00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:17,770
or could you could you believe that are
you know there's a common courtesy of

622
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,219
that

623
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,549
but are we try to remind people that
really don't have

624
00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:25,319
they shouldn't have any expectations
about being photographed because for us

625
00:34:25,319 --> 00:34:28,429
having a number photographs helps us
promote the event by showing people

626
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:29,710
having a good time

627
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,639
are showing arms that are full are
nationalist Hakansson radios

628
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,809
this is usually some people think it's
really easy problem solved just find a

629
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:37,859
bunch people with

630
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:41,418
use UV X 56 ones I will just have two
gether network

631
00:34:41,418 --> 00:34:45,768
you can do that and it kinda works but
it really doesn't cost that much money

632
00:34:45,769 --> 00:34:46,729
to talk to local

633
00:34:46,729 --> 00:34:51,220
our communications partner and say get
half-dozen her out a dozen radius radios

634
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,169
motorola

635
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:55,489
for the weekend and deal with everything
that way arm

636
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:58,880
and it tends to take people a little
longer to find the frequency just

637
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,390
if you don't really have a standard
radio out sometimes people won't even

638
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,788
try for whatever reason

639
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:07,759
yeah and likewise you know don't get
really crazy with trying to get

640
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:11,079
triple the script or radios and things
like that because honestly ninety-nine

641
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:13,700
percent of the stuff you can say is
gonna be boring as hell anyway

642
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,210
and Fitzroy secure you have a cell phone
everybody has a cell phone so talk with

643
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:17,930
that

644
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,288
mom but its one thing to think about
networking uplink

645
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:25,789
networking is the one thing at a time
the takes the most resources

646
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:29,380
that gives police benefit but everybody
expects it to be there

647
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,609
working because it's considered these
days to the utility

648
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:36,259
armpit knock-on we should spend at least
half a dozen people's efforts over the

649
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,029
course of

650
00:35:37,029 --> 00:35:40,150
not only the weekend but no weeks before
and after

651
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,190
up to make sure we have a network that
works mom

652
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,499
because invariably some peace hardware
on arrive or won't work

653
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:50,569
or such and such study bring his Cisco
gear but he can't calm until Friday

654
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:51,509
night

655
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:55,670
up so you have to think about all the
logistics are making an hour cap

656
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,749
thankfully for us against me said it's
just kinda dot

657
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:02,440
so we don't have to think about it mom
programs and scheduling scheduling can

658
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,779
be a real pain in the butt

659
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:08,499
a special speak prisoners up from
different areas and different time zones

660
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:12,690
arm but if you have somebody is really
diplomatic it worked out really well

661
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,489
%ah and if you're participants are
permeate your presenters understand that

662
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:20,170
you know you're working under such and
such constraints a lot of time they'll

663
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,390
be understanding

664
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,710
you have to obviously try to make I'll
special commendations for people who

665
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,190
either paying to be there

666
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,269
war or are otherwise point what big
names

667
00:36:29,269 --> 00:36:32,710
and the other benefit that we have is
that we encourage prisoners to in 10

668
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,289
attend the entire weekend and mingle
with people

669
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,690
because it just gives that much more
benefit if you're coming to see someone

670
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,710
to speak

671
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,940
and knowing that you'll be able to talk
to them later because they will be there

672
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:49,089
it also gives us the flexibility to
schedule people together better

673
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:52,609
and along with that too is the whole
idea of the program armpits come one of

674
00:36:52,609 --> 00:36:52,970
those

675
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,119
up things about an economy event that

676
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:59,410
of you don't have a lot of thought about
but putting together good program that

677
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:01,098
has actor information

678
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:04,289
map so the hotel bomb good

679
00:37:04,289 --> 00:37:07,400
bio information brief explanations of
all the different events that are going

680
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,029
on

681
00:37:08,029 --> 00:37:11,299
are invaluable mom got

682
00:37:11,299 --> 00:37:15,069
I can't tell you how many cons are
eventually going to that I had no idea

683
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:18,599
what the hell is going on because the
program was absolutely useless

684
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,130
mom and favor we've had a lot of
compliments but ours even though we have

685
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,359
some ads interspersed never my sponsors

686
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:27,920
no we we try to keep an eye on keeping
think Chris cleaning quit

687
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,249
just got just the information me nothing
more nothing last

688
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,880
arm but along with that we make sure we
put in things like rules and regulations

689
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,130
arm where to go Eve up where to find a
conference we can things like that

690
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:45,019
mom badges in and identification not
doing things like this

691
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:48,680
it's even a bit what this especially is
a huge pain in the ass

692
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,098
I believe during one of the talks they
said that these badges: re in seven

693
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:53,940
dollars per person

694
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,380
and we obviously don't spend near that
much on ours we don't go

695
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:00,640
as far as electronics because we just
don't have that kinda budget

696
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,930
white you know it's one of those things
that you can do

697
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,779
and things like this are nice because
their unique they're not gonna be

698
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:07,920
duplicated

699
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,940
high which have you has been tried and
other events

700
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,630
arm there's a couple people here who
have a knock-on in there there's example

701
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,619
one of our badges

702
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,930
cautious about a book ought to do on a
standard

703
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,859
lanyard and there there's a couple great
places you can get it done really really

704
00:38:21,859 --> 00:38:22,799
quick

705
00:38:22,799 --> 00:38:25,819
armband passes dot com being a really
great resource for that they do

706
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:27,130
backstage passes

707
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,950
and they usually do next day working
ship it FedEx 2nd day for free

708
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:34,950
I so you know there's there's been other
things we do is we keep the design under

709
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:36,410
wraps usually only

710
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,890
core staff sometimes not even all of
course staff knows what the badge will

711
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:40,440
look like

712
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,999
until it actually arrives became dove
minimizes the chance that people might

713
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:45,700
try to duplicate your badge

714
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,880
I do know some like sci-fi cons where
they just use a printout in like 10

715
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,509
those name tag holders

716
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:55,109
and I guess this is all going on blind
faith yeah like that 1p too hard to

717
00:38:55,109 --> 00:38:56,170
photocopy

718
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,470
mom bought me know if things to think
about how long the bed sometimes I don't

719
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,940
know the best design is until

720
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,410
I'm done and the other thing is you know
if you're charging 10 bucks a person

721
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:09,700
then maybe you can go with the photocopy
badge if you're doing

722
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:12,710
a hundred dollars a person you want to
give them something that'll work as a

723
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:14,009
souvenir

724
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:17,460
and will work for security purposes
because you don't want people just

725
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,849
you know randomly wandering through if
they ever paid the money because then

726
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:24,190
you're giving resources to the people
and they're not paying for it

727
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,109
and when the other four things keep in
mind is always having a place for for

728
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:28,440
people write their name

729
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,809
because events like this %ah you know
people will come up to me

730
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,920
and we'll have a conversation 50 min
service also yeah

731
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,589
are some is a he frog in the 200 shake
your froggy I don't know I just like

732
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,319
you're somebody that no one was halfway

733
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:43,808
not sucky to talk to you I'm so having a
place to put your name is actually

734
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:46,130
really important doesn't even come to
recognize you

735
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:49,759
are especially hacker con story of house
to CNN's releases

736
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:52,390
our t-shirts go along with badges
another thing you like you have to

737
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,049
consider

738
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:55,549
there's another one of those things that
you can spend a lot of money on and get

739
00:39:55,549 --> 00:39:57,180
very very little return from

740
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,640
I you might think that if your gonna buy
t-shirts you could buy a fight back some

741
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,430
attenuate plenty money

742
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,729
until you have half your t-shirt still
left over an approach you know in a

743
00:40:05,729 --> 00:40:06,799
brown box

744
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:10,390
I'll we actually end up losing money on
every single t-shirt sale

745
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,489
are for the first four years no we we
went for the bigger book because it's

746
00:40:14,489 --> 00:40:15,680
cheaper per teacher

747
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,649
but then when you only sell less than
half of them then you have to store

748
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,749
those t-shirts

749
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:23,440
you have to write him off as inventory
and you didn't recoup their costs in the

750
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,979
box teacher and you end up with about 50
her t-shirt senior

751
00:40:26,979 --> 00:40:30,680
bed for whom I at your house which
really sucks

752
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,430
mom one of the things that's really
important about a con especially

753
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,419
organizing one is keeping my eye

754
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,369
and what we mean by that is keeping your
staff motivated outside in the event

755
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:44,420
what would essentially happens every
event everybody expects a lot of effort

756
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,839
there's a lot I energy there's a lot of
emotion Sunday it's not assign every

757
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:49,599
site

758
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,719
has this catharsis and they say you know
what

759
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,930
I can't even think about this for a few
days are I don't think about this from

760
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,118
we actually went with them all and so I
went on a I had a rule or I won't talk

761
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,749
about the next icon for

762
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:07,190
no until a month after it was over and
that really was a disservice to us

763
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,089
because what I realize was there's a lot
of things that you really have to be

764
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:11,479
compressed

765
00:41:11,479 --> 00:41:14,759
and talk about and and debrief yourself

766
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:18,789
over about how things went what went
wrong what can you do better

767
00:41:18,789 --> 00:41:22,769
om and along with that you want to try
to keep regular communication

768
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:25,940
with your core staff we have an IRC
channel for example that we use that

769
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,690
core staff can use and talk about we
have our another are such an offer just

770
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,229
everybody can hang out

771
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:34,299
arm I try to make enough to have
informal get togethers to me about

772
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:35,150
things

773
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,569
no at somebody's house will just say hey
come on over crash tonight

774
00:41:38,569 --> 00:41:42,009
will buy sell or booze and was talk
about what it is we need to do or

775
00:41:42,009 --> 00:41:46,289
just talk about whatever general I'm and
in particular there's a lot of other

776
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:49,579
meet ups that you can have another
concert sample how many course

777
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:52,729
like people involved not coming sorry
opt out

778
00:41:52,729 --> 00:41:56,200
yeah there's like yeah there's like 45
people and I no hang out these people as

779
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,869
we can

780
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,930
and it just kinda keep state keeps that
the relationship there

781
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,368
and said just being online you're gonna

782
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:07,559
and one of the things we decided to do
is to keep momentum and to keep the

783
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:08,640
history

784
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,239
is to share everything that is created
as best we can

785
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,579
we keep records of things that happened
during events and contests we try to

786
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:17,869
keep records what server it was
displayed

787
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:21,279
and we recorded everything that is
presented

788
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:25,140
now we've started recording the of our
stuff but we don't generally sure that

789
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,558
for

790
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:29,119
lots of reasons but we make sure that we
put

791
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,910
everything online Creative Commons
attribution-share alike

792
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,430
you can download anything you can remix
in fact we encourage you to remix the

793
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,700
content into other things cuz that's
free advertising for us

794
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:45,359
all we ask is that you put the name out
on it somewhere

795
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,249
and my quest support because there's a
lot I feel maybe can attend the event or

796
00:42:48,249 --> 00:42:49,769
don't have the resources

797
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:52,859
and %ah it allows them to to still stay
involved

798
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:56,529
mom and finally up your own cheerleader

799
00:42:56,529 --> 00:42:59,769
nobody nosed even better than you so yup
tractor okay

800
00:42:59,769 --> 00:43:03,140
security arm one of the things that
happens

801
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,279
up the only con is his frantic sure that
things stay

802
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:09,849
level that nobody gets into trouble that
nobody does anything they should do

803
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:12,759
and so a lot of times you might run into
people they're like super super hard

804
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:13,469
asses

805
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:16,719
if they see do anything wrong they're
gonna kick your ass up %ah

806
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,809
and likewise there's the other group
time around rubicam their helicopter kit

807
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:26,039
do whatever you want break the hotel

808
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:30,569
which was I think what was the free yeah
I was

809
00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:33,900
you know there was a there was something
like one of the organizers actually told

810
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:37,170
people the hotel's not respecting us go
have fun

811
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,529
yeah INF fun fan of either yeah

812
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:45,430
so um

813
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:49,899
I so you know they're just kinda that
continuum

814
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,089
but one of the things you need to do is
for small say what school and what's not

815
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,930
call for example in Cleveland

816
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:58,910
on as an obviously here in New York
there's an indoor smoking ban and we try

817
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:01,049
to remind people that you know you
really shouldn't smoke

818
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:04,799
indoors we provide a place where they
can do that

819
00:44:04,799 --> 00:44:09,069
and one element over contracts is that
any alcohol that is seen in the space

820
00:44:09,069 --> 00:44:11,259
must have been purchased from the hotel
bar

821
00:44:11,259 --> 00:44:15,150
so we laid out you know if we see you
with booze it better have come from the

822
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,670
bar because

823
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,170
our names are on that contract in were
the ones who get hurt if you don't

824
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,809
follow those rules likewise if you have
something in Al Jean bottle

825
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:27,749
I have no idea what it is and I'm
certainly not going to taste it

826
00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:31,499
but keep the rules relatively simple
because if you want people to actually

827
00:44:31,499 --> 00:44:34,910
express themselves and the new stick
overall pile

828
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:38,890
up stupid rules on them they have no
like a legal reason behind them

829
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,700
30 they're going to fight back against
those rules or they're never coming back

830
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:48,440
and for us you know again we have kind
of a philosophy of

831
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,269
you know I we will be very very lenient
you know what will give you every

832
00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:52,979
opportunity to be yourself

833
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:56,160
likewise everybody knows that if you
fuck around with me I will kick your ass

834
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,848
out after having taking your money

835
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:01,299
that's the way it is if you want to be
an asshole that's great

836
00:45:01,299 --> 00:45:05,079
be an asshole on the parking lot we can
get you know picked up by the cops

837
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,069
arm eventually our community has really
bought into this because they know that

838
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:12,200
vacant be safer not have to worry about
their should get stolen

839
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,009
or have to worry about people doing
stupid stuff and they can help

840
00:45:16,009 --> 00:45:19,819
Aust police and the police each other by
saying know somebody for example will be

841
00:45:19,819 --> 00:45:21,819
putting a sticker on the bathroom mirror

842
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,349
ambiente yup hate what you doing you
know you're fucking up our space

843
00:45:25,349 --> 00:45:28,559
why do you need to do this let's let's
do something else and that's actually

844
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,759
one of the benefits of a slightly higher
registration cost

845
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:35,469
if you're spending the money to be there
and you're putting yourself

846
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:38,969
that much financially into it you're
less likely to cause a lot of trouble

847
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,249
for everybody else

848
00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:44,099
we actually last year had someone lose a
wallet and we had it returned to them

849
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:45,950
before they even knew it was missing

850
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:49,630
because the community feared about
making sure that something didn't go

851
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,140
back

852
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,348
and it was actually a wallet from a very
well-known

853
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:56,479
person organizer organizer up hope

854
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:59,499
of it lost his wallet and had a return

855
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:03,979
like five minutes and the other thing is
is what I say he ross purses them

856
00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:07,579
I'm issues isn't that the staff members
follow the same rules that the attendees

857
00:46:07,579 --> 00:46:08,049
to

858
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:12,029
nobody is exact if I see a staff member
with alcohol

859
00:46:12,029 --> 00:46:15,880
drinking a nap which they tend to do at
home get that no get it on here

860
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,400
you know you have to set an example for
everybody and even though we have a

861
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,349
forty

862
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:24,180
we don't need to be you know flaunting
that authority in everybody's face we

863
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:24,710
have to

864
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:28,509
whenever we exercise authority we want
to do it in a very

865
00:46:28,509 --> 00:46:32,309
not digging for more in a very measured
manner to make sure that we do

866
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:35,329
is Mikey it just as much as we need to
do nothing more nothing less

867
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:38,789
arm okay great a list the things to do
and not to

868
00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:42,309
and we're running its runtime on write
everything down always

869
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:45,549
if you don't write it down its gonna get
lost me for gotten just write everything

870
00:46:45,549 --> 00:46:46,489
down

871
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:49,940
be honest and forthright do not lie to
anybody especially your venue

872
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,969
the sponsor a presenter even your for

873
00:46:52,969 --> 00:46:57,700
even your attendees if you make an error
admit to a real quick this all common

874
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,589
sense stuff but I've seen way too many
events

875
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:04,288
just kinda up Benny about that kinda
thing and really get into trouble

876
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:07,319
be professional always especially when
you're dealing with other people

877
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:09,969
that are hackers because they usually
don't understand what it is you're

878
00:47:09,969 --> 00:47:11,160
trying to do

879
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,359
and you know they have a very different
perception of

880
00:47:14,359 --> 00:47:17,440
of how to do business bomb assume
nothing

881
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,759
what it clarify in to find almost
everything and what I mean by this is

882
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:24,769
what it says don't assume that if
somebody says

883
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:28,369
oh I I think I can do this that they're
going to get it done follow up with

884
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:30,950
things make sure it happens follow up
with your sponsors

885
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,619
follow up your with your EV a follow up
with everybody to make sure that they

886
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:35,819
know what's going on

887
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:38,989
and what their we know what your
expectations are I'm of

888
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:43,200
value your history um you know don't
forget what happened in the past

889
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,869
and make sure that you that you respect
it and try to you keep it is part living

890
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:47,849
culture

891
00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,039
and be ready to soil your vented to
anyone at any time I'm it's really

892
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,450
important especially for us here at

893
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:55,509
at it hope you some you say he was not
gonna

894
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:59,099
and I have to go into a real two-minute
speech about what the event as

895
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:03,069
how they might have a good time being
there and how they can get involved

896
00:48:03,069 --> 00:48:06,190
and you can never ever promote too much

897
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,650
more things to do be flexible because if

898
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,799
if you can't go with the flow arm you
know you have a real hard problem there

899
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:14,170
was

900
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:17,969
appt that happen in Utah up run by

901
00:48:17,969 --> 00:48:21,880
an organizer who had to have it his way
or no way at all

902
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,369
the party really doesn't exist anymore
because everybody said hey screw this

903
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:26,259
you know if

904
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:30,299
if you want except my thoughts or at
least be a little bit flexible

905
00:48:30,299 --> 00:48:33,670
I can do something else elsewhere keep
receipts for everything

906
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,979
a specially if it obviously have been if
its business from a weaker that

907
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:42,700
keep it simple unlike the slides I
utilize my bitch really pop pop pop pop

908
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,200
owns get involved with other conferences
were going to talk about this one

909
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,890
in in two minutes and finding still good
ideas and share yours

910
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:53,239
I love the art you see here at hope

911
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:56,789
arm I would hope to think is actually
somewhat inspired by

912
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:00,499
not a crime because I we had the
privilege having pretty ass and Emmanuel

913
00:49:00,499 --> 00:49:03,450
coming out to come last year they said
you know this is a really great thanks

914
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:06,190
you really captured the spirit above
what the heck no

915
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,140
what the hacking movement is about and
this year we come and we see lots of art

916
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,328
an interactive exhibits

917
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:15,039
and I said you know what I'm glad they
stole this idea now still a back into it

918
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:15,749
even better

919
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:19,349
because that's the way we do things and
the reason the Google Page Rank is on

920
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:20,059
there

921
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:24,019
is that we actually underestimated how
important it was to be really high

922
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:25,200
ringtone Google

923
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,410
but we kept our site stable long enough
that it just

924
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:32,509
magically appeared and we haven't had
audio-visual sponsor

925
00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:35,549
who gives us everything we need in
everything we asked for simply because

926
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:37,359
we had a really high rank

927
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,749
and we put their name in the footer
every page that is all it took to get us

928
00:49:41,749 --> 00:49:44,769
plasma TVs projectors computers

929
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:48,599
anything we ask if they have it they
give it and last year I think they

930
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:51,209
actually bought new equipment just
because we requested

931
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:54,599
and they also give us like gift cards as
prizes and stuff okie

932
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:58,009
things not to do never again kinda going
on what I said before don't ever assume

933
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:00,119
anything on blind faith

934
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:03,719
the second one is really difficult a lot
of people you're going to be working

935
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:04,069
with

936
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:07,130
are also gonna be your friends but you
have to recognize

937
00:50:07,130 --> 00:50:11,119
and have them recognize as well the what
you're doing is essentially a business

938
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,739
you know it's not personal we're here to
get this event and these things off the

939
00:50:14,739 --> 00:50:15,799
ground happening

940
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:19,839
so you don't take it personally arm
ignore backups to backup site in

941
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:24,349
and I lost our entire site last year
hoops mom

942
00:50:24,349 --> 00:50:27,769
and if you are leading try not to
demonstrate any you know any confidence

943
00:50:27,769 --> 00:50:28,509
problems

944
00:50:28,509 --> 00:50:31,930
or questioning your own judgment you
have to be a good leader if your gonna

945
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,069
make other people believe that you do
what you're doing

946
00:50:34,069 --> 00:50:36,839
never procrastinate that seems to be one
of our problems will to say although

947
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:39,229
both will do this next week or next
month

948
00:50:39,229 --> 00:50:42,950
it if you gonna do it next week you're
never gonna do it so set a time set a

949
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,779
deadline

950
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:47,339
set somebody do it and do it are along
with that you know never use those

951
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:47,979
phrases

952
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:51,009
and take anyone's I know what the fuck
that was alright

953
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:54,709
yeah real quick

954
00:50:54,709 --> 00:50:58,059
you know these are just a few things
ideas on how to promote the event

955
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:01,549
the one I'm going to to talk a little
bit is the rule of three

956
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:05,160
this is up and I D I came up with after
kind of

957
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,348
understanding how people came to find
out about now take on one of the things

958
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:09,910
that I ask attendees as

959
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:14,209
how did you me know how did you but what
how did you decide to attend nada con

960
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:17,219
and they would say well II software to
con

961
00:51:17,219 --> 00:51:21,459
and van Nam I want your website and I
spoke to my friend who went

962
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:26,640
and I thought hey that would be butting
in now and what I realized is that

963
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,589
through all the various avenues we have
of promoting icon

964
00:51:30,589 --> 00:51:33,650
if somebody was to hear about the event
three different times and

965
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,440
in different ways the more than likely
wait either decide to attend or not

966
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,209
attend

967
00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:41,880
they were kinda make up their mind based
on that just by putting a fiery furnace

968
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,999
on his face they're not going to do it

969
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:47,529
you have to do more than that you have
to give them additional reasons

970
00:51:47,529 --> 00:51:52,529
and reminders of what the event is and
what's going on

971
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:56,079
arm so that something fun to keep up up
a few

972
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,130
quickly tales from the trenches %ah

973
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:02,589

acts that were sought such a big deal we
had people driving and from Pittsburgh

983
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:37,680
that weren't necessarily part if not a
con just to attend

984
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,109
this little many rave that we were
throwing on Saturday Night Live our vent

985
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:46,910
om we have five hundred people in
addition to the 250 or 300 that were

986
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:48,308
already there for Nikon

987
00:52:48,309 --> 00:52:51,859
who didn't pay ascent to be there repair
a single set to be there

988
00:52:51,859 --> 00:52:54,930
and we actually ended up with people are
high on

989
00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:58,109
on acid in he and god knows what else
climbing trees

990
00:52:58,109 --> 00:53:01,519
and jumping up from them mom so you know

991
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:04,769
you want to try to investors have a love
of security of trying to be

992
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:08,119
firm but at least nice about it arm

993
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:11,140
elevators elevator socked they will not
work no matter where you're at don't

994
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,229
expect them to

995
00:53:12,229 --> 00:53:15,890
people will fuck them up having having a
good staff that knows to check the

996
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,538
elevators and check them often just like
blood sugar

997
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:23,619
mom will be a very good thing and
sometimes people mess with the elevators

998
00:53:23,619 --> 00:53:27,059
admittedly people like the sticker
elevators for whatever reason

999
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:30,589
what's more interesting and we actually
had happened when years people

1000
00:53:30,589 --> 00:53:34,058
added extra buttons to the elevator I
can't even courage that sort of

1001
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:35,489
attacking

1002
00:53:35,489 --> 00:53:39,229
extra funds rice good I'm stickers you
want to buy lotsa stickers they're super

1003
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:39,799
cheap

1004
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,499
however don't give them out at your
event send the money there before and or

1005
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:44,180
after

1006
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,670
now before after because the worst thing
that could happen has that somebody goes

1007
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,609
in the parking garage

1008
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:51,920
in plaster somebody's car with 500 if
your stickers

1009
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,059
the kinda sends the wrong message yes
you're gonna have stickers ransall them

1010
00:53:55,059 --> 00:53:58,529
because any sort of value means they're
less likely to just put them

1011
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:01,739
everywhere freebie stickers need to be
didn't

1012
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:04,849
alright now are we at a time

1013
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:08,930
I'm scared I'm gonna for sex article
Tomo

1014
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:13,640
of the that he'll about Shirdi here up
came and I think was not come one or two

1015
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,089
it was one of the early run on a const
and he comes into his talk room

1016
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:20,288
of about to give his presentation with a
full bottle tequila

1017
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:23,999
knowing full well that the rules the aka
the Khan said do not bring outside

1018
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:25,130
alcohol in

1019
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:28,700
so I go up to my father I'm going to
show you book are you doing with his

1020
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,289
bottle of tequila

1021
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:33,400
and he just files to me pulls out a
receipt from a hotel bar

1022
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,390
said they tried to sell it to me shot by
shot into a bartender for manager fine

1023
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:39,129
he said I to sell to me cost

1024
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,719
so you know some people will follow the
rules do the right way

1025
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:47,209
%ah including getting cheap booze and
yet the reasons that

1026
00:54:47,209 --> 00:54:50,880
I don't do our is on there hour trying
to sell the event

1027
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,900
Ohio Linux fest and this guy to comes up
in picks up a flyer like yes we're an

1028
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:57,859
art and technology conference and he
goes

1029
00:54:57,859 --> 00:55:01,440
I don't do art slams the player back
down in front of us

1030
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,369
realize that sometimes people won't get
it right away and maybe they're not your

1031
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,920
target audience and let them go

1032
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,130
art just two final things mom I started
this today

1033
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:17,339
soul there's not much there

1034
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:20,449
safely have a good VPN connection site
and have to do all this out

1035
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:23,819
over the radio network arm what I'm
starting up Khan or

1036
00:55:23,819 --> 00:55:27,910
and what Khan or .org is is a place
where hopefully con organizers can meet

1037
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:30,549
share details share resources and
information

1038
00:55:30,549 --> 00:55:33,489
because one of the things I've realizes
that a lot of us are kinda our own

1039
00:55:33,489 --> 00:55:34,859
little islands in the sea

1040
00:55:34,859 --> 00:55:37,979
and there's a lot of things we can do a
lot of things that we can share are that

1041
00:55:37,979 --> 00:55:39,249
would make a lot of sense

1042
00:55:39,249 --> 00:55:42,259
arm so I'm gonna be starting that
