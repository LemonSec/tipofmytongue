1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,170
Xbox really difficult

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:19,170
ahh

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,530
shuttle mission with

4
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,670
yeah the the front panels are coming up

5
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,289
yeah

6
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:44,839
its easy bill time because ice was up
until 4am last night working on this

7
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:45,399
though

8
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,760
yeah %uh

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,760
finish

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,820
Eliza

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,570
posts

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,740
who

13
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,740
wrong one

14
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:22,750
its

15
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,530
us

16
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,630
K well

17
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,630
okay well sub-par

18
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:47,230
s is good okay

19
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,399
well sorry about that my name isn't Matt
Joyce

20
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,000
hi um I'm sorry for the delay as you
could tell that I didn't actually expect

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,259
this machine to complete developed this
bad

22
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,880
cell yard it do foo um

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,119
the question is I get it from a lot of
people is that what the hell is this

24
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:06,860
talk about

25
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,209
so obvious it's about data analysis
which that's not obvious at all

26
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,150
cell there's a lot of different
components ago in today to announce a

27
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,290
lot different feel to deal with it

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,790
data mining is one that a lot of people
like to talk about in security

29
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,230
%uh statistics inference there's a Tonna
different mathematical equations used to

30
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,780
sort large volumes of data

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,880
and is done ton of different scientific
fields that deal with it

32
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,130
so I wanted to give a talk that kinda

33
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:36,310
briefly touched on how to deal with
large quantities

34
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,560
data explains people just how dangerous
can be

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,799
that there's a lot of large quantities
of data out there that we can all

36
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:47,760
access so I also want to make sure those
kind of entertaining I'm sorry thus far

37
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,399
been incredibly boring

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,739
my Paul in all tackle me thank you

39
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,180
cell I have covered most this

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,989
um does anyone like want to know what
inferences

41
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,650
ok that yes okay I sell

42
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:09,670
in France albums are basically learning
outcomes

43
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,329
they infer things they make assumptions
and then they make predictions

44
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,620
inference cell xx ago this is so it
showing up this is obviously not true

45
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm gonna fail horribly

46
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,290
it's all breaking apart and I'm
imploding inside

47
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,179
um this isn't a teacher statistics:

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,440
statistics is really fucking are there's
a lot of math because it is a million

49
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,470
different specialized equations for
solving

50
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,549
specific data sets the idea here is
coming up with a single set of data sets

51
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,750
in consort large lime

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,579
data quickly and efficiently that
doesn't mean sorta right

53
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:48,989
which brings us to our next slide Rico
fair me

54
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:52,370
now I can't really read that but
basically regal fairies this guy

55
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,540
what a five

56
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,750
yeah its

57
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,280
yeah exactly I

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,930
yet cell

59
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,010
I mean is not do that cuz

60
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,799
my machine is about ballpark and others
covered with my %uh

61
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,988
my voice and hopefully this all makes
sense in the end um

62
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:23,090
when I get the applications up to be
okay %ah

63
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,919
a real family saw the first Tomic bomb
dropped the anniversary was three or

64
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,030
four days ago he is also known for a
sort of like math called

65
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,090
varney math very math is usually talk to
children

66
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,990
and the reason is because you can deal
with very large sets of data

67
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,030
very large numbers you can solve things
relatively quickly

68
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,789
so the story that's famous battery cover
me as well everyone else is watching the

69
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,139
bomb exploded he's dropping pieces of
paper

70
00:04:47,139 --> 00:04:50,800
and he's watching the paper weight in
the wind that he's actually calculating

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,320
the blast shield from the bomb

72
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,820
so small volumes of data in some cases
with the right brain the right

73
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,150
causalities correlations you can figure
out

74
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:04,430
cool things in this particular case he
feel that figure out the blast killed

75
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,979
the bomber watching people

76
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,159
so data analysis

77
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:13,139
is all about doing shit like that seeing
something that looks

78
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,760
seemingly unrelated something else but
finding a correlation

79
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,020
and defining a predictive causality
doesn't have to be right

80
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,440
doesn't have to be cracked we're not
scientists were not writing PHD's

81
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,979
most of us are in the security field or
hackers were looking for

82
00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:32,780
love a solution to a problem that
problem might be how I

83
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,750
break-ins this website or I'm doing a
search on my own

84
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,550
network and looking all over on CBS code
and I want to make sure that my

85
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,250
developers are doing something stupid

86
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,419
like using user names inside their
application based off

87
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:50,729
loves let's say the name of the
application cell

88
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:55,990
ethics on some love you have them some
love you don't

89
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,490
when dealing with the analysis it's very
dangerous on

90
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,820
look at data analysis the wrong way you
can basically confuse people

91
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,340
you can analyze things and do things
like racial profiling and say that

92
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,650
all arabs a terrorist that's not true

93
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,260
most Arabs are very nice people they're
good people but there are

94
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,789
a large number tears in the world
happened be a very big to send their

95
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:21,950
for racial profiling works on paper but
in reality

96
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,330
it's not fair to people individually
thats ethics

97
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,650
the ethical don't be a douchebag

98
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:35,320
muscle course you have no ethics or
you're an American cuz we rocking it

99
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,110
manifest destiny began to everyone

100
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,490
the datum

101
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,280
what is data where is data basically
what I'm coming down to here is a

102
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,750
how quick hello there how to capture
data exist everywhere

103
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,940
knowing the number people as room
knowing the number people certain type

104
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,479
scholars avise knowing

105
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:57,010
genetic information knowing the
temperature for knowingly lie to her and

106
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,169
her family socket to meet or so many
windows

107
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:03,460
how many everything is everywhere how do
we catalog it

108
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,610
what day did we want to go after is it
relevant to what we want to search for

109
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,740
cell a little picture uva turn dressed
up as the a

110
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,789
be a alligator hunter got sup

111
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,990
trapping data a lot of people's for
trapping data will use things like

112
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,229
with the indie project your %uh you
basically coming here they're saying

113
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,060
hey you got this call ft badge if you
want to use it give us some information

114
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,779
about

115
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:31,700
they're dropping you dated collecting
there's other ways

116
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,320
trapping that his data exist in the wild
things like and we'll get to them

117
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,400
up CVS repositories online there's code

118
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,500
I'll online there's website

119
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,139
loss information %uh not it's a vent
right but there's a

120
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:53,090
there's something like that bright for a
if you ever go biking or running or

121
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,900
you're in a marathon these guys take
pictures in eight matchups here

122
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,750
number on your chest based off a no see
our algorithm so

123
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,979
if you know someone's name and they've
there into the sort thank you for

124
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:05,200
pictures of them online

125
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,849
so there's a lot of data out there

126
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,419
its pretty easy to find if you're
looking for something in particular

127
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,580
you'd be amazed at what you can find out
there spy ring mailing lists is a

128
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,599
one of the things i was looking into is
%uh its readily available to basically

129
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:23,570
pretty obvious

130
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,570
and it helps us understand communities

131
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:30,240
there's a lot of different mailing us
out there all open Alcan al

132
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,770
I like NYC resistor all this stuff and

133
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,000
I wanted to do some experiments show you
that even in

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,599
cultural setting or societal setting you
can see

135
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,870
how analyzing data can be fission or

136
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,480
inefficient as the case may be in
defining

137
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,070
correlations is there a correlation
between the size of a mailing list

138
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,200
the size the emails the number of people
on the list

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,880
the content to the list and does that
correlate to the success of the project

140
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,899
the failure of the project

141
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,220
as it turns out most the case that's not
true

142
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,190
there's really almost no correlation
that stuff

143
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,190
to

144
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,820
to

145
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,800
yep so extrapolating data is

146
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,520
really not that hard you find a large
dataset

147
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,829
on the Internet for instance the %uh the
schedule talks on the website

148
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:31,830
are actually apps de mes little bit us

149
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,880
well show you a little bit of a script
that can do this but you look at the

150
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,410
talks

151
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,589
on the schedule talks the way it's
broken down in HTML as you

152
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,370
very easily extrapolate all that the
event open to either database for flat

153
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,850
poly

154
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,930
can easily sort sort and entrance
applications for data mining

155
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,459
extrapolating days easy pearl is great
for

156
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:56,600
this is my troll post

157
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,360
there's a lot of people hate language is
don't eight languages

158
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,640
some languages are actually pretty
useful some aren't

159
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,580
pearl is very useful at parsing large
volumes of data and there's a shit ton

160
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,660
models written fort for dealing with

161
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,100
these algorithms largely because of
things like span assassin

162
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,270
annual network programmers being lazy
when it comes parsing data

163
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:21,260
there are other languages as well
they're really good see is really good

164
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,760
%uh that's actually bullshit list is
also really good I just want to piss off

165
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,819
lets programmers

166
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,310
um

167
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,230
again this isn't about math there's a
lot of math in this

168
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,020
it's about getting it done you don't
need to know statistics to use this

169
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,589
stuff

170
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,589
the simple fact is a guy who's into
computer security

171
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,930
probably does jack shit about statistics
in go to school for

172
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,540
he went to school for other things he's
not an economist he's not

173
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,360
a mathematician might be I know a couple
mathematicians are into the field

174
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,370
but in most cases if you're actually
doing with the waters waters are not

175
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,399
brilliant people

176
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,630
there people who are technically gifted
and

177
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,149
they're good at finding books that
doesn't necessarily mean that they're

178
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,800
scientifically brilliant finding a bug

179
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,020
in adidas structure that

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,079
isn't really a logic but is say a
correlation

181
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,010
great word is something anyone can do
without having

182
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:25,410
super huge amount of knowledge regarding
statistics

183
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,010
if

184
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,460
extra probability this to you basic
types probability that we're going to

185
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,100
discuss

186
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,660
because we're doing I'll linear analysis
is for probability in reverse

187
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,530
probability

188
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,780
in one situation you know the outcome
any other situation

189
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,780
you don't know the outcome so

190
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,120
in for probability you don't know the
outcome universe bubbly

191
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,000
know the outcome but you don't know some
of the variables going into the dataset

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,380
with a responsibility

193
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,760
and for probability usually this feeds
into these algorithms

194
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,280
how do you want to solve it what you try
to protect are trying to predict members

195
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,030
a dataset

196
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,510
work comes regression

197
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,390
is very simply explained up

198
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,530
gals is a a famous

199
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:19,930
guy as he claimed to have invented a
basically a

200
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:25,410
firstly a regression algorithms and the
reason that he is credited with that is

201
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,730
because he helped a guy track a comet

202
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:32,970
back in the seventeen hundreds us late
1700s 1795 ni

203
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,600
1800 area a man lost a common use
tracking bites on

204
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,660
back then you didn't have a lot of ways
to track things less your body's

205
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,670
so they're trying to guess where would
reappear again they had

206
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,630
this man's record of where he saw it
contracted in the sky which wasn't

207
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,550
exactly correct

208
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,860
but she was able to graph it and
basically

209
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,600
with up with regression you'll have a
graph with data points on it

210
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,970
and you draw a line through it and
trying to find a function that defines

211
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:03,980
how that data said

212
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,430
can be modeled with some things
especially astral bodies

213
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,550
its really easy to get a very clean line

214
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,000
and follow through to where it's going
to appear it worked so

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,670
the squares is what we usually use for
linear regression

216
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,900
it's a pretty straightforward %uh most
%uh view

217
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,960
worked on calculus were worked in a lab
in college

218
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,560
have probably done this whether or not
you know it it was probably brought up

219
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,320
in your

220
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,900
your lab class whenever you need it to
you a linear regression

221
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,900
you if you know you're doing winner
regression correlation

222
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,550
so correlation is basically once you
have

223
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,160
two sets of data that you when the
regressed you can try and see if those

224
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,670
waveforms as functions matchup in any
way if they match up in any way

225
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,780
the make or early they may not but they
make worley

226
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,819
if they do you might be we'll find
something out that see their third

227
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,950
factor or you might just be finding out
what you wanted to know

228
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,330
cell that brings us to the next

229
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,690
slut correlation

230
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,320
is something that's usually used
improperly its

231
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,960
when these things that's great about
statistics is you can live really really

232
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,450
well

233
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,650
using statistics throwing numbers that
people tend to shut people up and

234
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,530
ultimately he

235
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:34,800
mode their files seized about
correlations are pretty straightforward

236
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,210
sometimes just because a way for matches
up with another way form doesn't mean

237
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:40,830
that once

238
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,220
calls the other just means that the six
matchup that the underlying causes

239
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,750
datasets that you're not actually taking
into account or

240
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:52,580
it could just be a coincidence it's
unlikely but it could be other things

241
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,540
that run into a problem with
correlations when you grab stuff

242
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,010
um sometimes you'll see it it's very
obvious when you graph it that sometimes

243
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:03,340
the way the way form pops up is a
function of hell

244
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,820
the spread happens sometimes a spreads
can be completely different but stills

245
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,600
bring up the same way for which
basically means your prediction

246
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,620
is mathematically correct

247
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,600
by probability wise it's completely
wrong

248
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,890
so just going through the motions of
solving a correlated

249
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:27,790
function isn't going to necessarily
bring you any closer to finding

250
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:33,319
any real correlation truth

251
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,350
they've Beijing malcolm's are usually
used for %ah correlation in datasets

252
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,510
because a very fast

253
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,120
but they are not usually very correct
they're good class find documents

254
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,730
which is largely what you're doing what
you're doing data analysis on a network

255
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,680
not naive Bayes make certain assumptions

256
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,160
Bayesian albums and general make
assumptions their schools the statistics

257
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:54,500
that

258
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,980
are not fans assumptions if you going to
be PhD thesis with naive Bayesian

259
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,160
algorithm in there

260
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,199
odds are you can get for a because

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,220
if you're on a PhD level they want your
numbers to be exact

262
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,240
accurate these albums don't produce

263
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,370
exacting hi for results just like when
family was figuring out the blast killed

264
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,350
bomb

265
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,280
is accurate see was based on certain
assumptions he was making guesstimates

266
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,640
lots you don't functionally need to
always be correct

267
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,250
you don't function we need this and
that's why be is now gone Zachary

268
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,220
when we're trying to discover a way to
figure out how to stop spam showing up

269
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,280
in our inbox

270
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,430
some guy thought K we don't need to be
right all the time

271
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,180
we just need to be right ninety-nine
percent of the time his albums work for

272
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,300
that

273
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,170
except most you know all this

274
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,900
what God workers well action if you
skipped a couple here

275
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,860
yeah ok it so here's a picture up not
Thomas B is he was aware just not an

276
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,720
accomplishment that

277
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,960
mathematician he gave us to be Asian
fare from which many other albums are

278
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,390
two

279
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,650
right including a fish %uh thats basin
theorem

280
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,150
its pretty straightforward it's not
super hard

281
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,010
but it is a shit ton a bitter math

282
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,569
%ah work a work is really cool

283
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:17,369
workers like many other very expensive
schools except it happens be free

284
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,420
um yes

285
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,610
so the good side is open source means
you're not gonna pay a lot for

286
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,040
it can be modified as a lot of plugins
for it works with a lot of different

287
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,070
data acquisition tools

288
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:34,030
%uh the negative sides are on

289
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,500
its slow and it stores everything in
main memory which means you got a very

290
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,910
large dataset

291
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,480
its gonna crash its gonna crash art it
does however have the option to work of

292
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,430
a JDBC

293
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,040
and it can work of a six yr which is
pretty straightforward and useful

294
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,860
but the reason we use work is not
because it is here and I'll

295
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,450
the idea issues like a to figure out how
you're gonna bother you did he throw a

296
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,210
small party you days said in

297
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,580
figure out where the correlations lie or

298
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,689
how you want it go through it and look
for correlations

299
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,040
then you do it in another set a code
probably see if the large dataset if not

300
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,080
you can pry modeling like

301
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,540
it works this is gonna get

302
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:20,540
really dicey now

303
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:29,290
its us

304
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,679
fair

305
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:52,109
while

306
00:18:52,109 --> 00:18:56,590
should prosper sheen

307
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:03,209
area

308
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,710
you know what

309
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,110
I don't think I'm gonna bore you with
this um bike is really cool but

310
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,530
I'm only gonna show you a small part of
it because I can't see the screen

311
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,860
and I we have discussion with something
else %uh

312
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:22,100
open up

313
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:28,380
speech

314
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,700
directory is that the up

315
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:36,280
yeah I have no idea where I am

316
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,668
yet okay so that's not the right
directory

317
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:44,930
d hope

318
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,860
there

319
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,060
right

320
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,850
spin them along

321
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,899
I

322
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,669
your yes

323
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:07,159
you okay what is it looking for here

324
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:14,159
that's not going to help us

325
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,399
min

326
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:20,929
yeah I can see this okay so what good
I'm just gonna explain it to you

327
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,139
what allows you to do visualizations if
you open up in AR

328
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,909
at that by which is basically kinda like
really week XML

329
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:31,629
you basically dumping you define your
data types in a very simple database

330
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:35,480
so say you're doing a pro parts of the
schedule talks

331
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,730
you can grab the title

332
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,200
the descriptive analysis and the author
you got three different sets of data

333
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:43,740
there

334
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,580
unit described basically other stuff if
you wanted his location

335
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,340
the size of the room we know that angry
she is a small stream which means

336
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,499
obviously no one thinks

337
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:56,330
I leave me which is probably correct
since my laptop is working on

338
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,509
like a fool but a you for all the state
in Sulekha

339
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,830
you define the data types and then you
can run certain sorts and

340
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,990
searches and you can run linear
regression by itself in about 15

341
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,049
different algorithms

342
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:12,980
you can run up correlation

343
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,259
of about 50 other different algorithms
and it'll give you a correlated

344
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:21,139
a coefficient and if the correlation
coefficient is near zero

345
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,480
it means that there's probably no
correlation here so functionally if

346
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,389
you're looking for data

347
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:29,580
you extrapolate a shit ton of data on
your target great targets have

348
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,960
pass to exploration have existed I love

349
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,769
and this hassle over here for not give
it to me was a

350
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:41,369
he's actually sitting on psychological
profiles

351
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:44,749
I love hackers in the New York City area
over the years

352
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:49,919
that would make a great up a great day
to set another great it is I've used his

353
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,820
pace bins

354
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,100
peace bins can same code snippets
integration files from

355
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,240
idea it spins on freenode to say we're
not know if

356
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,490
pace bennis okay so if you're on higher
see

357
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,899
and you're looking for help someone
gives you a website to paste your

358
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,889
configuration or your source code into

359
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:12,570
and then you give them the link and they
can see it a lot of these are configured

360
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,509
with you know when your cereal counts

361
00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:17,649
were a recent post page so you could

362
00:22:17,649 --> 00:22:21,289
develop a spider to sit on their pick
that shit up and you can play with it

363
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,440
do simple stuff like searching and
sorting keywords like password or

364
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,759
my see connect or just of both

365
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:32,289
extrapolation you can find a shirt on a
really cool stuff but

366
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:36,649
the really cool stuff is when you start
looking for failures that existing code

367
00:22:36,649 --> 00:22:37,840
you can look for

368
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,820
offer a flows in print death you can
look for

369
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,889
system calls with variables in them and
then you can start figuring out which

370
00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:48,220
developers because they usually sign
their names

371
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,440
are the bad ones you can also see across
the board what

372
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,399
mistakes are likely to happen with
certain types code this is useful data

373
00:22:57,399 --> 00:23:00,549
for a person who's a systems
administrator wants make sure the iOS

374
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:01,470
developers

375
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:04,799
are not screwing up constantly but
doesn't want to get involved in looking

376
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,480
at the co

377
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,809
you just throw out a meeting hey listen
hi

378
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,019
your PHP developer we just wanna make
sure that you're not using a shirt on a

379
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,700
persistent connections constantly

380
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,570
or you know you need to make sure they
thing with my sick connected is not set

381
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,230
up sending

382
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,789
read you know simple stuff like that on

383
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:26,789
schedule talks get back to that is when
you extrapolate data

384
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,639
based off of people and keywords you can
do lexical analysis thanks to you

385
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:34,659
%uh an application by Princeton
University called

386
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:37,840
WordNet word that allows you to look at

387
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,259
a at sentence break apart the words to
pull them down values out at the

388
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:42,990
sentence

389
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,609
using that you can actually basically

390
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:49,710
set up keywords i'm looking for. uses

391
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,539
the word back so it'll give you pack
acting all the other stuff you need

392
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:57,559
i'm looking for usage data mining I'm
using first looking for usage

393
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,980
of culture jamming I'm looking for usage
I love whatever's happening in you could

394
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,179
basically look at the actually it
ricocheted back at the appropriate to do

395
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:06,519
this

396
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,350
are you can extrapolate pull the state
out look at those numbers and don't mean

397
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:10,919
to you

398
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,490
to: like a so you can look at the
numbers

399
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,200
in such a way where you're saying okay
we're all in this room we're all going

400
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,429
to talk certain talks are bigger room
circuit talks obvious

401
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:25,570
greater value so what this year is

402
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,168
are the greatest importance to all of us
is pretty easy to figure that out just

403
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,789
based off the weight numbers

404
00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:35,369
home but you might also look for
correlations

405
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:39,940
what people throughout the years are
seeing this ongoing his

406
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,419
great and added to that with the
attorney meta-data project you can

407
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:44,049
actually

408
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,000
see who's going in and outta rooms based
off location tracking

409
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,679
here so we can know whether or not a lot
of people come to a talk and leave

410
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,779
because it sucks like my talk I'm sorry

411
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,960
I moving on from there

412
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,619
extrapolating data so what a basic comes
down to is

413
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:08,580
you first want to define your dataset
you're looking you're hunting you're

414
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,059
saying

415
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:12,399
I want to know more about a specific
area

416
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:17,029
ives let's say I work for a hour I work
as a sis administrator so what I'm

417
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,929
concerned about is whether or not are
sensitive data sets

418
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:23,970
are available to someone were
predictable

419
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:27,320
so I want to define here's my sensitive
data here's the stuff that's connected

420
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,210
to

421
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,240
I poll all of that into a room based of
keywords

422
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,599
and I throw that into waco concern
analyzing I look for correlations

423
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:37,869
between

424
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:43,519
the full Senate code base path data for
all over our webs

425
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:47,659
do that and will end up with possible
correlations on user names

426
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:51,200
possible correlations and use it to
functions by specific developers things

427
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,019
of that nature

428
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:55,359
you'll be able to in theory

429
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,570
shutdown uses love

430
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,519
dick double date where say a developer
likes to use

431
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:06,269
this God username up got

432
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:10,570
so what are your developers like he's
got a lot hiding his code

433
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:16,299
you don't want that popping up a lot so
developer axe correlates with

434
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:20,220
rapid recurring got in use me

435
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,470
you see that pop up because instead of
doing the searching

436
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,769
all the code yourself you're running
against waco

437
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:30,029
or an application that's otherwise doing
linear regression

438
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:34,039
and that you're traveling it doing a
regression then doing are correlated

439
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,129
analysis and if the correlator
coefficient is above zero by

440
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:41,779
produced margin say a closer to

441
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:45,460
two to ninety you might want to be
sitting there going hey

442
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,899
this might be something I want to take a
look at you look at the graph

443
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:52,389
without a look at the data just look at
the Grafton see the graphs matchup

444
00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:56,109
if they do then you look at the data and
say could there be a correlation here

445
00:26:56,109 --> 00:27:01,460
could there be causality that makes
sense if not then

446
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:05,320
obviously you didn't find anything
there's a lot of data analysis that goes

447
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,109
bad

448
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:09,750
you won't find anything as we didn't get
to see with the

449
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,929
to the mailing list mailing list

450
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:18,039
here you would think that high traffic
means that the project's doing well

451
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:21,899
usually that's not the case a lot of
projects have a lot of high-traffic

452
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,830
don't actually do jack shit but

453
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,509
some do I'll the other thing that you
would think is

454
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:33,809
that you can push things like

455
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:37,240
looking at how explains aka cell

456
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,869
your mailing list sometimes you won't
see certain things immediately

457
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,889
and sometimes you'll be able use things
in otherwise think you could

458
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:47,109
for instance when you're looking at a
mailing list archive

459
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:51,619
you pull up a lot of them will have
Jesus digest some wall

460
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:54,659
can you pull the values that Jesus dot
digests

461
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:57,919
and use them against the values the non
geez it

462
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,470
usually yes because you can actually
figure out

463
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,659
predictably what the difference in size
will be

464
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,929
we don't care about exact number so you
can actually

465
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,590
generate using predictability Navy page

466
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:16,759
what the actual value difference should
be

467
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:21,740
on a scale ranging from starting at 5k
on up to like 96k

468
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,090
up to 70 K digest up

469
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:29,399
I am dying up here

470
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:36,399
I'm gonna take question it to you see if
anyone's lost what

471
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:46,129
us to the question again

472
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,680
I'll

473
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:54,440
define representation

474
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,990
yet

475
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,240
well it in some cases it screws up
thoroughly

476
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,440
in some cases it doesn't on it really
depends on what this is what for later

477
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,519
analysis is about

478
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,820
you need to look at the correlation and
extrapolate

479
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,870
all other data and isolate only the ones
that matter

480
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,450
that doesn't mean all but two that means
only the ones that matter

481
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,679
sometimes the underlying stuff that does
matter

482
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,429
is extrapolated as well

483
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:27,500
for instance there is a up there's a

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:31,909
weapons testing programs and by the
military where they set up

485
00:29:31,909 --> 00:29:35,980
%uh a camera that was supposed to look
at him mission to find whether or not it

486
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,220
was an enemy or nominee

487
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,630
and it was working in a lab every day
works fine

488
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:44,360
they assume you know the pictures enemy
not an enemy it's pretty straightforward

489
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,340
but they bring outside at all since not
working why is that

490
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,769
pictures taken of it enemy day were nice
day

491
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:56,510
allied a not a nice day its are picking
up the weather patterns is a the enemy

492
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,240
not enemy

493
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,380
so there's a correlation there that
isn't actually correct

494
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:08,380
cell I guess is that does that answer
your question

495
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,920
well you can't ride you predictive
analysis and predict what the values

496
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,590
will be and matched up against

497
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:26,210
what actually happens you basically
using your own analysis test data

498
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,460
for prediction else the and see if it's
actually matching up

499
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,300
sometimes you might be completely wrong

500
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:37,670
but flee the right looking at Newton's
laws for instance you'll see that

501
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,420
he was pretty much right now all cases
what is lost all

502
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,400
completely wrong so we don't care

503
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,810
if we correlate wrong so long as our
prediction is correct functional

504
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,010
so whether or not the representation is

505
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,730
wrong were right doesn't matter as long
as prediction works

506
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:01,050
if you happen to get it right without
knowing why functionally why not use

507
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:04,940
you might run into trouble down the line
but you know

508
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,700
in this case for our usage usually isn't
that important we're not building

509
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,470
nuclear weapons

510
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:20,470
I can hear you ship

511
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:28,789
for

512
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,289
al-zawahri yourself but up

513
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:45,500
anything else

514
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,670
nobody can predict the stock market
actually I'll mostly it's based off for

515
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,770
the media production

516
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,900
actual prediction is almost impossible
because you have

517
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,850
so many different systems working
against each other and

518
00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,870
you do have to protect you can predict
major shifts large companies will do

519
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,290
major things based of events that are
predictive

520
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:08,080
but with the tense what you're talking
about this two different types trading

521
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,720
day trading and there's long-term
training with and then there's other

522
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,750
problems like guys who use the Trent
small trading systems to

523
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,940
force through larger traits and

524
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,460
in specific scenarios you can predict
major ships

525
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,419
in day trading can predict a trading
responses because day traders all

526
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:28,799
generous pond same way to certain
actions

527
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,900
they'll sell off all their stocks if
they see a dip

528
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,160
below a certain amount allow these guys
follow scripts of sorts

529
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,890
they work out their own methods and they
work as quick as possible so in a

530
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:43,280
dangerous situation put a machine with a
simple predictive algorithm in there

531
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:47,010
as long as it's hooked up and moving
quickly the move faster than the guy

532
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,110
in a private one the first cousin today
training get in and out real quick

533
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:54,490
which means predictably it doesn't have
to predict anything major it just has to

534
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,530
get in and out quick

535
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:59,660
on a regular that basis and it will make
money a lotta guys how systems like that

536
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,150
they're not super intelligent

537
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,240
but they can predict movement and then
act like

538
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,080
with larger long-term she s predicting
large movements money

539
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,360
you can do that based on a certain
events you see the price

540
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,350
oil going out you know that you know
alternative fuel sources are suddenly

541
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,200
going to do well

542
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,040
but you also have human element wise
price well going up

543
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,220
sometimes it's simply because somebody
decided to buy a shit ton while to

544
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,750
affect the market on purpose

545
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,669
like the instance where a guy several
years ago guess was a year to now

546
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:36,960
push the price oil up two hundred
dollars a barrel just so you could say

547
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,110
he was the guy who did it

548
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,380
there are problems is predicting

549
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,880
datasets that large especially with
exchanges where there's so many

550
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,669
different elements coming in and how

551
00:33:48,669 --> 00:33:53,010
that you can functionally like we're
talking about here

552
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:58,660
but doing actual production on it's very
difficult I mean

553
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,059
that be my approach to it does anyone
else have any comments or suggestions on

554
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:11,059
that

555
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:16,099
I'll anomaly detection for intrusion
detection systems

556
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,599
anomaly detection is used a lot and
financial systems where or

557
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,899
spending modern yeah auditing

558
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:26,940
on other anomalies actually this is
really useful

559
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,500
and almost detection is really useful
for couple different things up

560
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,800
say you have a guy who's a programmer

561
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,520
and you're watching the cohesive Mets he
smits

562
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:42,649
30s SPN entries today not that much but
say

563
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,790
three thousand lines Kodak student
paramount

564
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,460
every day in and out all son his numbers
dropped down to 1000 lines today

565
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,109
that's an anomaly what does that mean

566
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:57,640
um companies looking for new work or
he's not be utilized properly

567
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,140
and then for intrusion detection systems
you run into

568
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:06,109
a guy who say logging in logging in
logging in at a certain rate and also

569
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:07,220
the locks in

570
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,690
16 times including five in the middle of
the night six nights in a row

571
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,840
is this guy breaking in om

572
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,880
predictive analysis is great that you
can predict what somebody's gonna do

573
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,810
when they don't do it you're expecting

574
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,570
they will basically fall under the guise
of take a look at this guy

575
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:27,450
the problem with this is and it's the
big problem

576
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,899
is with a large amount of prediction

577
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,510
there's a small percent error that small
percent error when projecting a large

578
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,619
set of data

579
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:40,150
will end up being a very large error
France's there's HIV testing just

580
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,550
recently where a guy

581
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,970
up basically I think about 50 percent
failure rate

582
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,660
on an HIV test products in New York City
so about 50 other people who were told

583
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,980
they had HIV did

584
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,730
that a huge problem the FDA's

585
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,960
%uh acceptable levels are two percent so
2 percent

586
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,490
I love say three million people getting
tested

587
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,530
is gonna be what six twenty thousand
people

588
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:10,940
I think fun math is right that's a lot
of people have just been told that

589
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,849
they're going to die

590
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:14,880
and they're not so in some cases all

591
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,960
yet while they're gonna die eventually
but and almost detection be very

592
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,770
dangerous especially with situations
like the TSA where they're going to say

593
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,369
this person is anomaly he could be
dangers flyer we need to

594
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,859
you know harass him and that's why we
generally have a problem

595
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:33,940
deploying an almost texan systems in
security situation

596
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,089
situations if you decide to go on your
once a lifetime vacation

597
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:42,200
to Honolulu and you have your card with
you and you try and use and also on

598
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,710
their screaming that's an anomaly

599
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,109
you're gonna be pissed because your
credit cards not working

600
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:51,348
and you look like an idiot at the local
restaurant and almost texan's

601
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:55,630
can work as long as they're reviewed
properly and

602
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,290
that's basically a big problem with an
almost texan systems

603
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,570
anything yet

604
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:04,160
yeah

605
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,250
ass

606
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,920
yeah so yet but the other great thing
about an almost detection systems is say

607
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,640
where

608
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,799
doing something like me about a lot out
there which is analyzing large volume of

609
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:16,369
data

610
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:20,380
especially now face a tell ya you could
start say

611
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,569
throwing of that by midday to buy
throwing random shit out there that says

612
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:28,480
I'm an anomaly I mean anomaly another
anomaly I'm still an anomaly

613
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,030
I'm gonna continue to be an anomaly all
the livelong day enough people doing

614
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,829
that you can

615
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:35,910
stark and it's a tough things are true
um

616
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,460
a couple people have written books about
things like this where

617
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,230
in a situation where they're looking for
anomalous activity is City the way

618
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,579
people move on buses

619
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:47,940
if you start talking with the way the
tracking system functions

620
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,849
it's not going to be able to predicts
anymore how that works

621
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,589
problem with an anomaly detection
systems one so what are the variables is

622
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:55,509
compromised

623
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:00,109
entire detection system is thrown out of
whack so

624
00:38:00,109 --> 00:38:04,450
if I compromise the value of my location
in the city

625
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:09,299
and feet over someone else only their an
anomaly if I keep doing that sixteen

626
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:10,150
other times

627
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,520
everyone cinema anomaly than the whole
system breaks

628
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,609
palm is an almost detection useful yeah

629
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,890
it's very useful anyone else

630
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,078
okay um

631
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,210
sup I don't know if I've

632
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:32,279
even gotten this anywhere near where I
wanted to be. here's a problem

633
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:35,549
is I did a lot of security outing for a
while and we do you %uh we usually

634
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:36,609
followed scripts

635
00:38:36,609 --> 00:38:40,069
and scripts are kinda like this you come
in UC application

636
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:43,470
you run it through a bunch about fathers
brute force tactics they look for

637
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,180
problems

638
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,180
if they find a problem the report the
problem you have to Manly detect whether

639
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,190
out promises

640
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,470
802 logical analysis they don't to code
review they don't do a lot of things

641
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,619
a lot of our banking systems work of
this theory

642
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,809
you going you check it is it working

643
00:38:58,809 --> 00:39:02,950
okay could I break it by throwing a
thousand different problems that

644
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:06,779
no we can do the same thing with large
fines de

645
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:11,079
we can throw a predictive analysis

646
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,599
%uh we basically go extrapolation linear
regression

647
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:18,270
correlation predictive analysis and
that's just the intro

648
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:21,309
it's not important to do severe stuffed
unless

649
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:24,980
you've got the money to do it and you
think it's worthwhile but for everyone

650
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:28,039
who's out there got a large climate data
you can do a small

651
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:31,329
number steps there's a shit ton its
walls for doing it there's a tunnel I

652
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:32,289
raise for doing it

653
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:36,190
there's no reason that water to system
administrators can throw this out

654
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:43,190
on a network into details there aren't
very many tools out there that procured

655
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,010
towards the security industry

656
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,029
om for did for that's our date houses a
lot a bookstore to come out about a lot

657
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,660
of people are starting to figure out
that

658
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:55,799
yeah we have a lot of this data floating
around there's a lot of reports as a

659
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:56,700
lotta love

660
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,500
for instance back in the day we're
outside Citigroup center

661
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,099
and Citigroup decided to throw out for
five boxes of paper

662
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,819
and as for five boxes paper consisted of
%uh financial records for

663
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:12,900
mostest City banks customers

664
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:16,140
yes you're there

665
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,490
yes

666
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:23,029
so yes so City

667
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:26,930
core actually throughout their financial
records during a 2600 meeting in front

668
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,410
of us

669
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:32,210
on shredded several thousand streets a
paper

670
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:35,500
um aside from the immediate threat apart

671
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:39,089
posed by this you out there financial
data their name their address key idid

672
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:39,710
OTA

673
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:43,220
you can you shoot some data mining all
those people in figure out things

674
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,020
about Citigroup that you they may not
want to know like with the marketing

675
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,788
tips another cool thing is %uh

676
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:52,900
I saw this one on the internet was a a
guy Ste basically

677
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,000
sat down and said why do people go to
check cashing places

678
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,740
in the ghetto and as it turns out the
reason is very simple

679
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,180
are no banks in bad neighborhoods if you
look at the back the locations banks

680
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:09,250
they avoid bad neighborhoods for reasons
people are poor don't have money

681
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:13,270
they don't spend money in banks they
gotta check cashing place because

682
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,940
cheaper

683
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,970
banks can be expensive for someone who
doesn't have good financial sense

684
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,569
so doing analysis update is very very

685
00:41:22,569 --> 00:41:26,910
very very important for us and I'm
trying to stress that this tall

686
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,069
its trying to give you the tools they
need to do it

687
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:33,520
and I if anyone doesn't know how to go
out

688
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,109
figure out how to do this please ask
questions

689
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:41,740
so um

690
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,140
may throw this stuff up and %uh I'll
make it available

691
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:49,109
at this think I'll put it up at a

692
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:53,089
Sendai as he and tari dash systems

693
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,650
syst and ass dot com

694
00:41:56,650 --> 00:42:00,160
and I will post a link to all the
application the

695
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,279
presentation the code and %uh only to
wake up

696
00:42:03,279 --> 00:42:06,430
and a up tutorial for skiing star with
using it

697
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:12,140
I'm sorry I couldn't get this I work on
my laptop but a

698
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,868
hopefully you guys are gonna go out and
actually take a look at some these tools

699
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:19,319
grab on thrown in on your environment
and a

700
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:23,420
start dealing with large fines data and
saying hey

701
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,020
I'm seeing ship that is bad

702
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:32,849
I love anyone more questions

703
00:42:32,849 --> 00:42:34,160
shoot

704
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,060
words

705
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,250
well let's think I'll I've done a couple
lines

706
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:45,790
up I really gotta tell you that I love
the coat pace been one was prior

707
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:46,779
treasure trove

708
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,840
on you go in there you'd find to be
response he finds your day exploits

709
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,950
you could actually do a search for
shellcode inside a talk peace been data

710
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:58,010
and you pull up pretty much every
exploit ever

711
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,180
don't in there and some that would be on
release because guys be testing out with

712
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:02,960
their friends

713
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,740
cell depending on where you expected to
be above that serve high-value

714
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:12,470
probably want to choose your target
first and then think about

715
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,610
all the different effects like a
butterfly theory thing

716
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,770
that they have on the world um

717
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:23,450
uses a lot with reverse engineering up
businesses French it for instance are

718
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,790
trying to figure out how

719
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,820
the universe began and that

720
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,390
by the time we figured out when it
begins because we figure out background

721
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,319
radiation

722
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,760
and how emanated and you're able to look
back at it and say

723
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,100
I'll wealthy background radiation in the
universe tells us that it began

724
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:42,220
I think was $1.3 trillion years ago $13
trillion

725
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:45,730
now four thousand I'll

726
00:43:45,730 --> 00:43:49,250
rafter Jesus loves you

727
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:54,910
so it if you analyze the things coming
out things going into a black boxes I

728
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,790
and you can figure out what's going on
inside the black box design

729
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:02,570
if you are looking at a bank for
instance or you're looking at a hospital

730
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,850
and you want to figure out well how many
how many drugs are going it's a place

731
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,920
where the drug stored so I can break in
there with my friends and steal them

732
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,380
um you can do that you can say okay the
trash being thrown out every other day

733
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,610
we know that they're moving this many
needles we know that the Niels go up and

734
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,400
down to fluctuate during the months we
know usually when they're delivered

735
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,970
they'll be more free with run them out
especially it's like small clinic

736
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,450
and %uh you Kansas pretty much just bugs

737
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,150
of sorting through their trash go okay
now's a good time drop them

738
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,690
same is true up anyone um if you sang
out

739
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,440
outside a bank you can say okay when do
they come for pickups with their lumber

740
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:40,950
truck

741
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,720
up okay they come every fourth Wednesday
of the month okay then I'll

742
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,440
all that among the the day before
Tuesday cell

743
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,750
this is all an ethical stuff it's also
good for ethical things

744
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,500
like doing this to yourself and saying
okay well obviously we need randomized

745
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,360
things a bit

746
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,140
we need to not do this in a predictable
fashion we need to sell the bank

747
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,779
company that they need to deliver their
money at random intervals

748
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,680
so that we don't if you real hard home
great stories

749
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:15,779
okay um here's one

750
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,330
how we discover that %uh cuban missile
crisis at the

751
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:23,630
documents had missiles it wasn't really
did analysis but they're flying overhead

752
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:24,650
they see a

753
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,950
they see what look like soccer fields

754
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:34,110
and that doesn't exist in cuba their
baseball playing country so why their

755
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,190
soccer fields

756
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,460
so the way we figured out that their
nuclear weapons

757
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,820
in cuba was because we saw the russians
building soccer fields not because we

758
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:43,830
saw missiles now because we knew
anything about

759
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:48,590
the moving over there we just knew that
the russians playing soccer so

760
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:52,150
doing analysis up extraneous dated

761
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,340
can be incredibly useful um

762
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,160
they would also any questions

763
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:04,710
shit

764
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:08,990
um they didn't actually was numbers I
was pushing a pretty art but I couldn't

765
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,310
get it up to anything where crash my
guess is since it's being stored main

766
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,850
memory the crash occurs

767
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,089
when your system runs out of memory so

768
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:21,270
if you have a very small machine it will
crash a lot quicker than if you have a

769
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,259
very large mission

770
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,730
so you analyze your data set

771
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:32,730
and its its you know 3,000 that could be
one sales

772
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:40,300
yeah

773
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:47,149
agent thousands actually marginally
bigger

774
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,240
pressure would handle it by now %uh
cells work as a very small numbers to

775
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,890
take while the churn through that

776
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:57,259
on if you start doing transforms on it
it'll do set to transforms

777
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,000
and we can be kinda slow it's not
designed to be

778
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,080
the optimized approach designed to be
the one that gives you

779
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,440
a very easy smooth interface is good
results cell

780
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,750
if you're planning on doing constantly
may want to look into a more specialized

781
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:13,820
solution

782
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:20,820
but if you're just doing it for the
first time see what you need will be fun

783
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,720
any other questions concerns

784
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,290
anyone wanna tell me I'm horrible on the
hit me

785
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,240
way

786
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,250
here

787
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,950
get one of these lights actually I can't
see any view

788
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:37,359
so I'm actually extremely paranoid I
think that there's people back there

789
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:38,549
making faces at me

790
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:42,509
here

791
00:47:42,509 --> 00:47:44,249
a yeah so

792
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:48,240
a nose dive on this 1 I'm sorry guys %uh
other

793
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,460
any other questions I'm wrapping it up

794
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,289
is Tommy to wrap it up I'm at a time
night
