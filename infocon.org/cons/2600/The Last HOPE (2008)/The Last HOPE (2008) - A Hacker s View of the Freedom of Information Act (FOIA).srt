1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,590
us please thank you a great my speaker
just

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,480
write-offs and I have to talk a little
bit more about what's going on

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,690
on the second floor if you guys checked
out the hammocks on the second floor yet

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,619
how many of you slept there last night
okay

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,350
I saw a lot more bodies than one in
there so I know you guys are lying okay

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,450
to we have to honest people in the
audience

7
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,880
%uh how many people are planning on
crashing the annex tonight

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,730
okay

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,780
how many people have not how many people
don't know where the crash night and

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,370
don't care that they don't know

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:44,079
okay %uh the reasonable majority there

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,149
alright I'm also I just um if i may
announce something if

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,589
my the personal burns I'm coming up in

14
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:55,100
the room next over the next two hours
we're gonna be talking about hackerspace

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,870
is

16
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,929
I one very important talk that's an
earlier version the talk which launched

17
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:00,920
NYC resistor

18
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,469
and hack DC and also um if you guys are
missing anything you need a charger

19
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,409
batteries things like that

20
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:10,899
is that the hackers marks we've been
taking care of people as anyone in here

21
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,630
got a special request fulfilled by the
hackers market

22
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:17,100
okay well there's still more time left:

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,469
and so without any without any further
ado this is something that's very

24
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,610
important everybody should know

25
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,259
how to fly yet anything that they can
get their hands on

26
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,600
the government is supposed to give you
this information and does not show you

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,600
exactly how to do it give a round of
applause everybody okay good I'm

28
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,469
untethered to within a five foot radius
from this point: up my name still

29
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:47,219
Lapsley

30
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:50,329
and for the last several years I've been
working on a

31
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:54,399
a booking a website on the history of
phone freaking and

32
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,299
as part of that one in my big tools has
been using the Freedom of Information

33
00:01:58,299 --> 00:01:59,289
Act

34
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,299
and a it has turned into an

35
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,719
a a long artists a sometimes bizarre
odyssey

36
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,840
and have become a little bit of a
reluctant expert in the Freedom of

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,760
Information Act

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,120
so I wanted to talk a little bit about
for your butt

39
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,180
I also wanted to present from hackers
perspective because I've been spending a

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,440
lot of time thinking

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,950
about phone phreaks on hackers and how
they view the world

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,590
and that turns out of course to be how I
view the world being a fun freakin after

43
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,500
I and so I attend if you feel that way
as well

44
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,870
so I wanted to to look at it from that
perspective I'd like to start with

45
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,430
little historical quiz

46
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:42,150
so does anyone remember this

47
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,640
have a rabbi I big to report to you in
your 19 people starve 13 came to the

48
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,010
city population is now 106 there should
really be clattering a teletype in the

49
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,329
should be on yellow paper

50
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,790
right has 0 who played him a rabbi
anybody

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,500
we got three forehands okay the thing
which was cool with it

52
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,959
hammer eva is a very simple game was
written in nineteen sixty-nine

53
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,569
a Britain and basic I would assume I

54
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:11,620
and you have simple setup decisions as
leader i've

55
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,680
this country you know how many acres do
I plant you know

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,459
how much food do I make this sort of
thing but there's something was really

57
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,250
unique about it which was

58
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,650
it didn't come with a manual you ran the
program

59
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,290
and then you had to figure it out so
okay want to plant

60
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,040
a you know hundred acres lol 2,000
people starving there only a thousand

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,828
people to begin with so you know bad
news I'm a rabbi

62
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:38,220
I think a report I so you had a good
play around with it

63
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,019
and that a friend observed

64
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,439
that this is exactly what phone phreaks
do is exactly what hackers doing I would

65
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,500
suggest it's exactly what for
researchers do it's the joys of a black

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,150
box

67
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,349
and as a black box I mean in the
engineering sense of the word not in the

68
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,069
phone phreaks on to the word black box

69
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:58,069
but in all cases if you have a black box

70
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:02,319
like a hacker with the computer or phone
freak with a switching network

71
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,750
you got this thing right you can poke at
you can product you can see what it does

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,120
you can see how it reacts

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,329
and it's fun to do that and you like
several phone phreaks I talk to

74
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,730
in an interview said akashi no the phone
system

75
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,949
was really this mystery to me is this
this pair of wires

76
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:22,229
came into the phone and there was no
real documentation about it

77
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,320
and I was really curious about how does
it work i mean all the wires go up to

78
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,349
the telephone poles but beyond that it's
just a big black box

79
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,410
and I'd listen and hear these tones and
what are those times

80
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,470
maybe what if I make the stones and you
start doing things in you know pretty

81
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,139
soon here

82
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:39,650
for cheap and you know you're off to the
races and

83
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,520
for as much the same way there is
documentation on for you can go and

84
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,479
download the Department of Justice
manual its

85
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,969
you know four hundred pages long and you
almost learned nothing from it

86
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,639
I'm partially because it's four hundred
pages long partly because it was written

87
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,440
by lawyers

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,780
but also because it's not so much how to
sing

89
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,750
its almost about the theory of foyer as
opposed to what agencies actually do

90
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,740
which varies really widely

91
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,380
so given a black box a hacker's first
thought tends to be

92
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,690
how does it work what are the rules if
I'm playing camera by right

93
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,729
play around with until I understand how
it works the hacker second thought tends

94
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:17,620
to people how to exploit the rules how
do i win

95
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,660
and so that's what that's what I'd like
to talk to today

96
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,889
I'd like to talk first about what are
the rules of the Freedom of Information

97
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:24,720
Act for for AF

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,630
which gets used both as a noun a verb
and also how you go about exploiting

99
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,050
them

100
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,220
so the Freedom of Information Act is a

101
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,539
United States Los a federal law I it was
passed in nineteen sixty-six has been

102
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,740
amended a buncha time since then

103
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,229
and you like any law just link the in
house all sorts of

104
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,479
love you know some parts in whatever but
boiled down in its simplest form

105
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,360
it says that and agency must make
records

106
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,370
promptly available to any person doesn't
even have to be a US citizen

107
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,400
given just two things one is that the
records are reasonably described

108
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,880
and two is it the requests are made in
accordance with published rules

109
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,250
and each agency gets to publish its own
rules so you know you need to send the

110
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,870
requested this address

111
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,289
you know I suppose I could say things
like it needs to be on lavender colored

112
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:16,068
paper with five by seven margins but for
the most part they don't do that

113
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm so this really fundamentally a
pretty simple thing but of course the

114
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,960
devil is in the details

115
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,159
and so if you look at some other fine
print on this will first of

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,240
cuz it's a federal law it doesn't apply
to the courts

117
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,229
and it doesn't apply to succeed because
a federal law doesn't apply to the

118
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:31,060
state's

119
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,349
and because is a federal law for the
executive branch it doesn't apply to the

120
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:35,810
courts for the congress

121
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,000
so it really just a place to federal
agencies a you know the FBI the CIA the

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,690
National Security Agency the

123
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:45,639
Department of Health and Human Services
the federal Farm administration

124
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,220
any of these kinds of federal agencies
on

125
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,650
agencies in charge fees it's not
necessarily free although it frequently

126
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,620
is

127
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,870
um they have 20 more talk more about
these

128
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,400
they have 20 business days to and I am
underline this

129
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,080
to acknowledge your request okay yes
mister Lapsley

130
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,270
we got a request thank you very much
we'll get right on that

131
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,900
a it the the only other time limit is
that they have to do it properly

132
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,199
well what is promptly me well that is
being argued in the courts

133
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,000
um there are certainly for your
requested a fan out for more than 10

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,819
years at this point i'm happy to say

135
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,520
none of mine have although I wasn't
working on the project for three years

136
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,568
one of my request has been out for two
and a half years so

137
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:31,590
out but I'll I have some data on how
quickly at least one agency response

138
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,009
and it's generally a lot less than that
now

139
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:38,280
if you're familiar with the way laws get
written they tend to come in one of two

140
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,180
varieties

141
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,830
writing one is you must do this thing

142
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,020
except when you can't and ready to is
you can't do this thing

143
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,659
except when you can so this is one early
is you the agency must do these things

144
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:55,430
must give people these documents

145
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,289
except for a few cases

146
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:04,000
so what are these cases these are these
are called the exemptions to foil

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,220
and you'll see these little b1 b2 b3
these are the actual subsections

148
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,020
up the Freedom of Information Act that
govern these different categories

149
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,289
and just like for you is a inward I

150
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:20,349
b1 b2 b3 et cetera you'll hear that all
I got this text on that ass too bad

151
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:23,628
so what is exact national defense
information

152
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,659
you can file a Freedom of Information
Act with the Department of Energy asking

153
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:27,969
for its latest and greatest

154
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:31,020
a nuclear warhead design preferably the
small one that fits and

155
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,450
artillery shell and you're perfectly
fits perfectly valid for your request

156
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,330
that and they will simply say the entire
thing it's

157
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,650
tonight on grounds be one national
security are

158
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,890
internal personnel rules and practices
have an agency

159
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,740
so you know you wanna know what the
cafeteria menu is there something like

160
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,380
that

161
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,750
you might be able to get that you might
not exempt from disclosure because I've

162
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,770
another law

163
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:56,010
so in the US federal grand jury
testimony and transcripts are secret

164
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,189
so even if the FBI had one they can't
give it to you under for

165
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,250
because there's another law that says it
can't be given out trade secrets

166
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,070
I'm you see a lot of this that you know
I have a I'm you know maybe I'm

167
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,530
havoc company that has a dark a contract
and as part of my contract

168
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,569
I'm reveal some trade secrets to the
government you a competitor

169
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,610
mein kampf for my trade secrets

170
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,290
interagency members not available except
by litigation

171
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:24,339
out what the hell out is I'm I have
action ever done that objection menu my

172
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,160
requests

173
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,140
personnel medical files the sex happens
a lot a lot of names will get wiped out

174
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,650
law enforcement records b7 the 7c is
probably the biggest one which is

175
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,560
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
so if it's an FBI file on your names

176
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,530
mentioned in it

177
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,319
your name tends to get blacked out
unless you're requesting your own file

178
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,170
and then be eight which is probably
relevant to the current banking crisis

179
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,020
examination or supervision of financial
institutions as for some reason exempt

180
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,720
from flair for them because they don't
wanna cause runs on particular banks

181
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,370
and then geological data concerning
Wells I don't know who got paid

182
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,710
for that but somebody must have

183
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:05,380
oh and one other thing I'm sorry I
forgot separate law which maybe you can

184
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,340
see down there

185
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,660
the operational files have the CIA NSA
national reconnaissance and Defense

186
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,130
Intelligence Agency

187
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,160
out that doesn't include historical
files and it doesn't include

188
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,910
administrative files but

189
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,910
you know you can ask for you know he
tell me all the black projects that you

190
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,600
doing right now

191
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,140
I mean rather technically you can ask
for that I'll just say no

192
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,220
now the thing which is really cool about
fully is it really is as simple

193
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,250
as four sentences sentiment email

194
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:36,260
a fax a letter right its dudes

195
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,600
I got this is totally request under the
Freedom of Information Act

196
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,010
right that sent this one you must state
that it's a for a request

197
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,319
I request you provide me with a copy any
and all records regarding

198
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,620
Bloody Bloody Bloody Bloody right you
have to described accurately the records

199
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,630
are looking for

200
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,689
3 you have to tell them who you are not

201
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,050
as an individual but who you are as a
class a person the reason this is

202
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,200
important as it determines what fees
they can charge

203
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,960
so I'm individual requesting this
information for non-commercial purposes

204
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,350
so that's that tells them what the
category for UN and forth

205
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,440
I am willing to pay up to X amount of
money for this you have to say that

206
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,050
because

207
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,320
if you don't since they're allowed to
charge fees they could just house

208
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,800
request back and say well you know you
didn't say that you're going to pay

209
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,070
anything so we're not gonna processes
until you do

210
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,370
so it's really those four things but
that's all it is and it can be a simple

211
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,120
email you know if you got on the web

212
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,380
search for like 4 templates you'll see

213
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,450
um you know all sorts of you know
four-page monstrosities with all sorts

214
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,150
of legalese and stuff like that

215
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,340
it really does need to be a complicated
there are some there are some nuances to

216
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,270
it but it really doesn't need to be much
more than this

217
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,280
and at this point every so every agency
accepts by

218
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,850
a by letter obviously and also by fax

219
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,900
most agencies except by email and it
simply has to do it for ya at FCC .co

220
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,640
it's really that simple use fire off an
email

221
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,330
okay so that's what it looks like in
terms of what the request years

222
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,120
and also has the process go so you start
by sending your request

223
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,510
and some unfortunately low-paid clerk

224
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,069
is gonna look at it and file it log it
and send you an acknowledgement letter

225
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,220
that I guess but mccue at some point a
slightly higher paid clerk

226
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,890
is going to a take your thing to look at
and say okay we have to search for these

227
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,500
records so mister Lapsley said he wanted
information on

228
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,820
you know whatever it is a a phone freak
incident that occurred Miami in 1969

229
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:33,110
okay now imagine this clerk and here she
is

230
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,770
sitting in front love the FBI's record
system

231
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,540
now the FBI has to record systems out so
what they call the manual index in the

232
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,089
automated index the automated indexes on
computer

233
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,930
and it's everything from 1973 on and
it's mostly is keyed by subjects first

234
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,470
and last name

235
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,900
that's the ultimate index the manual
index consists love

236
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,530
65 million free by five index cards

237
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:01,780
you think I'm joking but I'm not also
keep my last name

238
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,060
so are hypothetical clerk looks at this
and says

239
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,780
blue box incident Miami 1969 hmm

240
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,870
I wonder blue boxes last name

241
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:16,000
no not there nope not there either

242
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,150
no records on it's not quite that bad
but it's almost that bad

243
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:23,360
and and this gets to and that by the way
that's not really

244
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,850
I can't really blame the FBI for that
they've designed their filing system to

245
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:27,260
be

246
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,240
responsive to the kinds of things they
deal with problem with them the vast

247
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,190
majority of stuff

248
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,860
they deal with at least a used to deal
with was around names of suspects right

249
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,690
so it makes sense you can optimize our
index that way

250
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,970
they do have some things in subjects but
not many M

251
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:45,730
a lot of agencies are like that so will
touch on this later but it becomes very

252
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,700
important to understand

253
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,180
how the index system of the agents
you're dealing with its structure

254
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,030
because that

255
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,360
tells how you're gonna how you gonna
send in your request but let's just say

256
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,470
hypothetically that our clerk and found
some documents regarding this this

257
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,300
incident

258
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,370
they then take these documents that say
it's three or four files and they put it

259
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:05,370
in a stack

260
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,420
and because it another Q and later some

261
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,710
higher-paid clerk is gonna look at that
and is gonna say arkin there were four

262
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,930
files here

263
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,720
and three of them have to do with blue
teddy bears and one has to do with a

264
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,660
blue box

265
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,260
and so we're gonna take the blue teddy
bears and for those over here has are

266
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,120
not relevant

267
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,380
and the blue box 1 we're gonna go
through and we're gonna have redact out

268
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,689
a bunch of stuff like names and what not

269
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,350
and then we're gonna send the documents
and that's assuming by the way that the

270
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,320
documents wrong classified if the
documents are classified as into a

271
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,200
different cue

272
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,380
where people who actually have
classification clarence go through and

273
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,040
say this parts unclassified this part is
classified

274
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,060
so as you can see there on the out the
left hand side there's a time line

275
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,460
which says possibly die of old age this
is happening

276
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,560
but eventually you get you there are no
records response for

277
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,600
or some goodies now

278
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,920
how long does it take this is this is
real one hundred percent bona fide

279
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,080
genuine Data

280
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,090
lovingly extracted out of hundreds of
our request i file

281
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,260
be a this is of the FBI and

282
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,380
the top chart is for cases where I got
no records

283
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,270
now you would expect that no records
responses come back quicker than records

284
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:16,189
responses because somebody didn't have
to go through these piles of paper and

285
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,760
redact

286
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,620
the sort of thing now on this top chart

287
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,670
you'll see there that thats calibrated
in weeks

288
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,280
and this is the number request I got
back in that time so on average it takes

289
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,970
a few getting a record seven days a week
so a couple months the fastest when I

290
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,770
got back within 11 days

291
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,510
and the longest was a 185 days so

292
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:39,740
why 185 deaths while it could be because

293
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,880
they lost a request which does happen I
find about 5 percent my request end up

294
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,689
getting this router miss filed

295
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,180
it could be because they were just being
super diligent and they were

296
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,340
they were looking for you know they send
out when their field offices to search

297
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,290
for and they couldn't find anything so

298
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,170
you don't really know now when they find
records which is the lower

299
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:05,080
graph I he average times about six to
seven months to get documents back from

300
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,300
when you send it in

301
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,880
the fastest I've ever gotten was 59 days
which by the way with Joe and rescued

302
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,720
rivals

303
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,160
FBI file and the slowest with 16 months
I should say that's the slowest I've

304
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,400
actually gotten documents

305
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,970
back like I said I have one one request
outstanding for two and a half years

306
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,760
with an essay

307
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:30,760
I'm note that I've change the scale here
on the large graphs of months not weeks

308
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,070
now how much it cost to file a formal
request

309
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,290
well actually filing for a quest is free
how much it cost to get documents

310
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,000
depends on who you are if you're a
commercial researcher

311
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,110
so if you are you know somebody who
wants to know what your competitors are

312
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,170
up to in this happens a lot the FCC

313
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,820
right if you're you know horizon you're
constantly filing for a request to find

314
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,770
out what the other phone companies are
up to

315
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,939
you have to pay for search time and
copying costs if you are a member the

316
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,630
news media if you're a member of an
educational institution like a student

317
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,850
if you are a non-commercial scientific
researcher so I can nonprofit science

318
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:10,359
house

319
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,890
search time is free but you have to be
copping hospital talked us into 100

320
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:15,630
pages for free

321
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,339
for all other requesters which is
probably a lot of us

322
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,688
certainly as me you have to pay for
search time

323
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:25,689
and copying costs but you get two hours
a search time for free and you get a

324
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:26,870
hundred pages for free

325
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,120
now what's that worth to you well it
depends an awful lot on

326
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,750
what the agency is what their policies
are and how their files organized so for

327
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,120
example at the FBI

328
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,240
because they have this fairly

329
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,780
concise system other than the 65 93 by
five cards

330
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,850
a you know two hours a certain time is
all you'll ever need

331
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:50,600
so you're never gonna get charged for
search families I never have and then a

332
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,770
hundred pages I'll actually send you
more like 180 pages cuz they figured

333
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:56,660
there's some threshold below which is
not worth billing somebody for two

334
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,340
dollars and

335
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,290
hunting them down to get them to send
you a check even if they are the FBI I'm

336
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,420
so so for the FBI it's pretty simple on
the other hand another example is the

337
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,780
NSA Haus the NSA

338
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,379
for files relating to a a military phone
system called autobahn

339
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,360
which some you may be familiar with and
they came back and said sure we'd be

340
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,190
happy to do that we think it's going to
be

341
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,520
I think it was ten hours search time in
eighty dollars an hour

342
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,470
but you know what water masers
twelve-hour search I'm in eighty dollars

343
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,350
an hour but we'll throw in two hours
free

344
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,680
so you a hundred dollars and oh by the
way we like that up front

345
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,830
and I demure to that point said it
wasn't worth it

346
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,909
on conversely with the FBI have also
gotten letters back saying

347
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,800
I'm you know get the search was great we
found ten thousand pages

348
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,409
you get a hundred pages free so you know
you never sent us a check for nine

349
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,470
hundred ninety dollars

350
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,960
so and when its opponents a big number
of pages I'll ask for payment up front

351
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,429
generally speaking they down okay

352
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,470
so given the what we've seen here is

353
00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,700
it's really easy to request for a thing
but they're going to attack the hell out

354
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,850
here document something to withhold
entirely

355
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,520
it's gonna cost you some money and it's
gonna take seemingly forever is it even

356
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,550
worth bothering

357
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,909
and that depends of course on who you
are what your temperament is

358
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,120
I'm historian type guy I view is panning
for gold

359
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,720
and occasionally you get some nuggets am

360
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,370
I don't know how well you can read this
this is a letter

361
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,590
from J edgar hoover to the Honorable
John D erlich man the council to the

362
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,350
president

363
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,820
that is the president's attorney in the
white house in 1969

364
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,210
and this is regarding drive levels join
Gracia

365
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,560
and another phone free cruise name is
redacted out its efforts blank you see

366
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,010
there

367
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,500
and it's saying that on August 27 1969

368
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,390
this bureaus Kansas City office Kansas
kansas city missouri was confidentially

369
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,630
advises Southwestern Bell Telephone
Company

370
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,900
had developed information that blank and
Joseph in Brescia

371
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,150
Miami Florida allegedly have discovered
us means to intercept telephone calls

372
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,740
transmitted over the defense
communication agencies autumn

373
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,600
automatic voice network for Audubon and
the wide

374
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,320
area telephone service or what's eight
hundred-numbers

375
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,100
so goes on to describe audubon

376
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm according to the source of this
information it is not known whether

377
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,490
Blackburn dressy actually intercepted
telephone calls

378
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,710
T on either audubon or what's however
both allegedly stated that they can do

379
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,780
so if need be

380
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,149
the secretary of defense and the
director of the US Secret Service have

381
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,929
also been advised as to the foregoing
Sincerely Yours

382
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:33,380
J edgar hoover now I kinda think that's
cool you might have seen there's a thing

383
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,720
at Slashdot recently about

384
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,220
another guy who's a professor
anthropology who also have gotten this

385
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,700
filing

386
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,730
and royal bridal article about in the
sky needed some neat little slice of

387
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,140
life

388
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,890
although I have to tell you that were
right to be

389
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,440
john erlichman or the former director of
diff secretary of defense for director

390
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,410
the secret service how do we know what I

391
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:55,669
make up this really it's like yeah okay
thanks

392
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,070
thank what the faxes its

393
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,870
as a it makes you could also to me it it
is an interesting thing to see like what

394
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,140
is

395
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,190
what was the FBI up to what were they
thinking what why

396
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,130
was this a useful way of communicating
and and to me it's a little bit of

397
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,320
history that you wouldn't get

398
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,820
now another example another little
nugget that comes up

399
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,780
a so this conference is a poor sponsored
by 2600 magazine many have you know that

400
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,500
before

401
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,630
2600 there is a magazine called tap for
you

402
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,679
all the technological American party or
the youth international party line to

403
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,330
change its name a couple times

404
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,980
so I had requested their FBI file

405
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,810
so it turns out tap have the bomb who
knew

406
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:40,870
vball right so this letter

407
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,060
which used to be classified secret its

408
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,010
subject technological American party and
the category violation is

409
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,510
Atomic Energy Act includes from New York

410
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,200
are two copies each Department energy
assessments have material

411
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,610
for previously submitted New York office
no classification even close material I

412
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,060
E

413
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,460
secret see the big step secret K

414
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,720
the Department of Energy has requested
FBI investigation in view of the

415
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,669
enclosed

416
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,419
tax assessments New York initiate Atomic
Energy investigation to identify sources

417
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,290
documents

418
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,610
I'm gonna skip the page here this is

419
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,179
this was a cover note on that this
matter was initiated in April 1979 on

420
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:24,110
receipt of information from an
individual who attended a tap meeting

421
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,030
at the meeting individuals discuss
procedures for defeating alarm systems

422
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,360
and making atomic bombs

423
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,380
leaflets were passed out the
conservative making use a pipe bombs

424
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,929
Tomic bombs pipe bombs at a subsequent
meeting

425
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,770
a purported to see dissertation on the
making for how Obama's furnished on five

426
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,760
1479 this documents furnished apartment
energy for technological assessment

427
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,179
by letters on July 27th in August 13th
do is response reflect the conclusion

428
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:51,820
that quote

429
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,060
there is a possibility that such a
device could give a nuclear yield

430
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,830
unquote dewey's evaluation includes the
documents contain

431
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,899
Seaford or restricted data so

432
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,669
again for me that's just a fascinating
kinda thing and I do have the Cheshire

433
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:06,510
catalyst

434
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:10,480
is in the audience someplace maybe

435
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,460
he was the editor of tap at this time he
was the guy who ran the THC 79 meeting

436
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,360
so okay so those are a pair of a

437
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,660
above love goodies that you can get from
this

438
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,130
I'd like to talk a little bit about some
common hurdles in Iran to when you file

439
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,210
for your request

440
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,710
the first one is is privacy and I think
this is really this is a problem

441
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,260
both for you is a requester and
legitimately for the government as an

442
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,110
agency interested at some level in
protecting

443
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,660
its citizens privacy and its kinda
spectrum

444
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,660
so on the left hand side there's no
problem if you want to request files on

445
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,980
yourself

446
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,840
that's easy cuz you giving your
permission by the request and less my

447
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,418
foot note says you have multiple
personality disorder in which case you

448
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,220
probably need notarized statement
smaller personalities

449
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,280
on if you want to request information
organizations on

450
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:02,960
dead people or leaving people with their
permission again no problem he just

451
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,240
include the

452
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,790
the permission slip basically I was told
you I spoke for missions

453
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:12,668
was important on the far right hand side
the privacy problem is

454
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:17,050
living people without their permission
so if for example I wanna you wanna

455
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,129
so you wanna feiler a former Quester
Phil Lapsley and say the FBI has a

456
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:25,560
file on me you request Phil aptly go
through those cues and piles of

457
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,600
documents we talked about but at some
point they get a file and they look at

458
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,810
me say wow

459
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,320
well there's no evidence to say that
Lapsley is dead number one and number

460
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,939
two

461
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,320
the requester didn't submit like in a
copy of an obituary or something like

462
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,129
that

463
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,550
so size I'm saying a bitch rammed with
at this coffin

464
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,750
but so you know I don't think we can
really do this

465
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,310
I don't think we can give this file so

466
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,610
that that becomes a problem and I think
from a from a

467
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,179
and then the FBI actually goes one step
further which is they say

468
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,350
gosh you know even the fact that left
only one thing to respond to and say

469
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,210
Phil Apsley has an FBI file

470
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:07,000
but we can show it to you but then
there's a while but even the fact that

471
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,710
phil has an FBI file that might be

472
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,370
not a good thing to reveal about him
people might assume that he's done

473
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,159
something bad

474
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,290
maybe it was just you know a background
check for security classifications

475
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:20,720
nothing ominous so in fact we probably
ought to respond to this was a thing

476
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,380
saying

477
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,720
we can either confirm or deny my simply
can't process request

478
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,370
and what's interesting actually about
that he is there's nothing in the law

479
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,720
that says that that's about

480
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,800
think there's nothing in the Freedom of
Information Law this as an agency can

481
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,960
neither confirm nor deny but they do
routinely

482
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:41,250
we'll talk about that in a second then
there's a a middle area

483
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,730
in the middle area is if you request
something by file number so say for

484
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,390
example you request file

485
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,790
87 dash LA dash 1234

486
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,678
and see that because I've some sleuthing
you did that you happen to know that

487
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,260
that is Phil lapses FBI file

488
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,929
you got this from maybe some other file
where that number was blanked out maybe

489
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:03,310
somebody told you you befriend an FBI
agent whatever

490
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:07,879
so now the FBI says hi well

491
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,820
he just requesting this file but it's
about living third person we probably

492
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,889
can't give this out

493
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,240
and they're gonna send you that same
letter saying well please tell us

494
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,419
who the file is about and we'll tell you

495
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:21,290
if you know if you can prove to us that
there that their dad will give you the

496
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,080
file

497
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,490
and you say gosh I am I have no idea who
the files about

498
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,440
maybe Feb a little bit there I'm I don't
love the files about

499
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,990
you need to give it to me anyway I'm
requesting a file right I mean again

500
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:37,760
going back to you know right here

501
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,730
records are reasonably described that if
the file 123 dash LA 4567

502
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,700
right it doesn't get much more
reasonable than that so the FBI will say

503
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,370
I now we can't do it and so what you
want to do is appeal

504
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:55,919
you appeal to the Department of Justice
appeals panel Department justice appeals

505
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,550
panel least in my experience

506
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,178
has in every case that this has come up
spank the FBI

507
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,950
and said did you guys not read the
4-hour

508
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,159
them reasonably and

509
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,230
so then they have to go on process the
file which is fascinating because you

510
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,940
get back a file where names were blacked
out except perhaps that you already knew

511
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,169
what the names were

512
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:20,580
and so you pretty much have a complete
file I'll tell you I honestly don't know

513
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,870
how I feel about that I mean I

514
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:24,950
as a researcher I feel really good

515
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,710
but as a citizen its kind like okay so
you can come to an end run around this

516
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,149
privacy thing it seems like the privacy
thing is pretty good

517
00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,820
and then I put on a researcher had again
I feel great so

518
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,310
um so that's that's one way to deal with
the privacy problem

519
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:43,060
our jump around the roadblock another
thing is you should I'm sad to say

520
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,030
become a cool

521
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,080
should become very familiar with the
Social Security Death Index

522
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,260
and newspaper obituaries because when
requesting information on people if you

523
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,940
can show their dad and the FBI will turn
over

524
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:57,570
the FBI use to accept Wikipedia articles

525
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:04,570
they don't

526
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,750
so that's one problem the second problem
is what I call the No records problem

527
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,899
and what this chart is showing here

528
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:18,380
the blue line showing for the FBI how
many requests they've gotten over the

529
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,560
last 10 years

530
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,379
so it peaked at around 27,000 requests
in 1999

531
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,550
it's been pretty much going downhill
with one little deaf but now they get

532
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,760
around 12,000

533
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,000
13,000 quest every year the redline

534
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,480
shows what percent of those came back to
the requester saying no records

535
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,770
it started about 36 percent and now it's
about 72 percent

536
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,210
why might this be well

537
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,440
the FBI's answer to this is two things

538
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,460
number one that

539
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,480
all the people who had FBI files who
wanted them

540
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,250
have requested them and so of course now

541
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:03,340
you know all you all you punk kids are
requesting FBI files and it was back in

542
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,480
the nineteen fifties a week up files on
people really don't keep so many files

543
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,429
in the morn so as a result there just
really not there anymore and so

544
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:12,500
of course no records response for its
gonna be hi

545
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,950
in addition the FBI says

546
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,159
there was a website which one to talk
about called get my FBI file dot com

547
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,050
and get grandpa's FBI file dot com which
makes it very easy to request an FBI

548
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,889
file

549
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,929
and they said and that his tricked a
whole buncha people into thinking that

550
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,760
they have FBI files and so it's

551
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,510
cause a Giants slugger requests you know
there's been a huge surge in a quest

552
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,700
I and as a result these are all
requested on actually we don't actually

553
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,600
have files

554
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,320
and you say how cats interesting cuz you
look at the blue line and you watch it

555
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,040
dip down in 2007 and so I don't see the
huge spike in requests

556
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:57,230
and then hey wait a minute that website
didn't actually even launch until 2008

557
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,590
so so there's some good else going on
there and

558
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,810
you know it's hard to know exactly what
it is I think the answer really

559
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,470
two additional things one is that the
FBI is destroying documents

560
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,169
and I don't mean just trying to
documents in like a

561
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:15,130
for lack of a better word a battering
evil way they have a lot of documents

562
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,880
they have too many documents

563
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,919
they don't need all of them right not
every file is a fist Oracle significance

564
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:21,639
and so

565
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:24,290
since nineteen eighty if they've been
destroying things and they worked at the

566
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,850
National Archives come up with what

567
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,060
would say call the document attentions
plan retention plan which is a force

568
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,010
also known as a document destruction
plan

569
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,300
and so they're destroying records and
that's probably what they should do but

570
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,020
one of the side effects so that is that

571
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,649
more and more you're gonna get a record
classes because there just aren't as

572
00:30:40,649 --> 00:30:41,360
many wreckers

573
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,720
a summer one number two is the FBI has a
lot of heart policies have changed over

574
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,350
the last 10 years

575
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:51,980
that maybe make sense from their
perspective but they also serve

576
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,590
to increase the odds that someone is not
going to get the files are looking for

577
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:01,500
I'll give you a couple examples the FBI
has about fifty seven field offices plus

578
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,159
it has

579
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,159
headquarters in Washington DC so if i
right

580
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,870
to headquarters up the FBI and I say I
would like information on the

581
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,880
technological American party where the
youth international party line and

582
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,860
organizational fun freaks and new york
city in the nineteen seventies

583
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,950
do you guys have any files on them they
say no records

584
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,909
really that's hard to believe and I
write to the New York office

585
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:28,850
so yeah now they have that on a bomb did
you see that files really interesting

586
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,720
and you know it's like well wait a
minute so then

587
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,659
didn't New York correspond with
headquarters well absolutely

588
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,720
they absolutely did and so the
headquarters had a file on them at some

589
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,370
point but

590
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:44,980
it got destroyed and so unless you
actually specifically wrote to the field

591
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,690
office

592
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,120
you're not going to find that file now
most people including myself I started

593
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,419
this

594
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:53,889
don't know that so if you really wanted
to check to make sure the FBI

595
00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:57,020
didn't have any files on your want to
get all the files on a particular topic

596
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,389
you need to write headquarters and 57

597
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:04,850
you know field offices now remember I
talked about the manual index on the

598
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,300
automated index the $65 million three by
five cards

599
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,630
so the FBI has change its policy but it
used to have a policy that

600
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,659
unless you specifically said look in the
manual index

601
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:19,389
they wouldn't so they type your turn
into their computer if it came back

602
00:32:19,389 --> 00:32:20,220
nothing

603
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,169
then they say no records even though the
computer only one from 1973 on so if

604
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:27,840
you're talking about something happen in
1972

605
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,750
it just wasn't on the computer finally

606
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,790
a the FBI records things only

607
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,918
by what they call main subject so Phil
Lapsley if

608
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,730
I had a file with with if there's a file
on me specifically

609
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,810
I would be a main subject however if I
was simply mentioned

610
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:50,760
in somebody else's file I would be in
what's called a cross racy index but I

611
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,879
would not be in a min subject index

612
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,220
they want search process see references
and chill they've done a main file

613
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,020
search and send you back something
saying no record so when you get no

614
00:32:59,020 --> 00:32:59,740
records

615
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,870
you have to know that you should respond
back to the FBI and say no I'd like you

616
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,330
to look in the cross for seeing this is

617
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,470
and these have all things that have
changed over time and as a result

618
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:16,470
you get more and more no records

619
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,429
so so the question was are they also
farming out the documents so they can

620
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:25,260
say we have no records if they are

621
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:29,730
I'm not aware of that um the and I think
you'd you might run into some legal

622
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,770
problems making that argument although

623
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:36,330
aware I'm what the FBI actually is doing
at the moment is they are building a

624
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,059
giant

625
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:40,649
Central Records complex in Winchester
Virginia and they're actually moving all

626
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,230
of those field office files

627
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,200
into one place and so a the claim is by
2010 you won't have to go through the

628
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,900
shenanigans writing 57 different field
officers

629
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,320
and then the public relations person
told me that this morning added quickly

630
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,189
the proviso

631
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:59,210
on if our budgets are cut and if if this
and if this and if this

632
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:04,909
so but maybe by 2010 so we do about this
fall one other things you do

633
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,659
is you I'm you do all districts that we
just talked about

634
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,919
you request by file number cuz it's
harder to say no

635
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,899
records when you're asking for a file
number that's that specifically

636
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:15,668
mentioned although

637
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:19,580
it does happen I you talk to people at
the agency

638
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,168
a or for people who used to be the
agency spent a lot of time trying to

639
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,830
study how the file things

640
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,929
I'm you request the same or similar
topic in different ways

641
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:33,250
so you try and come out from different
angles I'm

642
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,020
and the final one we talked about this a
little bit but assists not as common as

643
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,739
the other two

644
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,919
but you know aficionados have any spy
move your

645
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,440
familiar with the phrase we can neither
confirm nor deny the existence of

646
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,350
whatever it is I and thats in for ASP
calling clone war response

647
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,580
and that's an honor the 1975 for your
case with the CIA

648
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,350
I'm if you're not familiar with its
kinda fascinating the CIA and fuses

649
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:02,500
Howard Hughes built this ship called the
claw marks floor and in 1974

650
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,210
one out and it was built for a single
purpose which was to go out and lift

651
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,440
a soviet servitude song of the bottom of
the ocean

652
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,220
and the sub unfortunately broke in half

653
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,760
on the way up but that's okay half a sub
is better than none as they say in the

654
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,330
CIA

655
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,080
and so they got from that they got

656
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,160
you know soviet soviet a somewhat
twisted

657
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,080
missiles they got nuclear warheads I got
picked up keys I got all sorts a bit

658
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,549
thanks

659
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:33,020
that story eventually broke in 1975 or
so

660
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:36,310
and a bunch of journalists and filed for
your request to find out about it and

661
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,869
the CIA responded saying

662
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:41,550
can neither confirm nor deny and that
went to court

663
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,690
and even though it's not in the foyer
law supports agreed that yeah

664
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:48,920
that's probably actually a reasonable
response into probably

665
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,530
is from and intelligence perspective the
problem of course with it is

666
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,080
with all things it starts to to mutate a
little bit and so now more and more

667
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,490
agencies are starting to use

668
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,570
lamar style response okay

669
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:08,220
so a few hints arm file early file

670
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,280
often file broad file narrow what I mean
by that is

671
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,710
it take so long you better file sooner
rather than later if you have an idea

672
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,390
something you want to follow request on
file it today

673
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,690
because the file too much how I
guarantee you it'll take two more months

674
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,640
to get it right file often on a friend
of mine said was a frequent for a

675
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,529
requester

676
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:30,359
when one of his request got denied ice I
said oh gosh that's too bad my

677
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,910
that sucks they said you know I try not
to care about too much about any

678
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:36,330
particular request try to make it up in
volume

679
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,350
so I'm file broaden file narrow

680
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:44,180
if you know the file number that's
absolutely great file a request for this

681
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,299
particular file number

682
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,070
but also file a general subject request
because maybe there are three other

683
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,850
files you don't know the number of

684
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:55,970
you should expect delays if you're
trying to complete your PhD in History

685
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,920
a you know next week and you suddenly
decided the foyer is a good approach

686
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,680
it's not for me one YV on keep track of
your request to follow up on

687
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,759
like I said about five percent of my
request

688
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,950
get lost or mislaid especially request
field offices for the FBI because people

689
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:13,300
the field offices don't really

690
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,020
deal with this so much as I like for
your request which was the son this to

691
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:23,300
whatever I'm so you gotta gotta keep
track of what you file to make sure that

692
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,369
they send you stuff

693
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:28,560
Aqeel some many or most niles

694
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,770
your choice I don't think I'd appeal all
denials I think that's obnoxious

695
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:35,750
and that gets to the next couple points
but I will say this:

696
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:39,930
the Department of Justice used at this
really cool thing called before a hot

697
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,390
lines

698
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,930
play a counselor hotline which I guess
is sort of like a suicide hotline except

699
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:44,669
as for for your

700
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:48,950
and and they used to be there not so
helpful today but two years ago they

701
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,859
were super helpful

702
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:53,339
and and so I I call this guy Miku no um

703
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,660
I submitted something to the FBI and
they said no records

704
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,990
and it was like talking to a grizzled
veteran of the foyer wars right

705
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,000
he was just like he's like yeah direct
response media

706
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,869
boy gosh I'm shocked on and then he said
I said what so

707
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,450
help me out here do it should I appeal
this he said well

708
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,460
let me ask you to questions and you
could tell you wanted to say let me ask

709
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,359
you to question

710
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,049
punk but he didn't he said let me ask
you to questions he said question 1

711
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,950
do you want to get these documents said
yeah

712
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:27,810
he said okay question to do you have the
documents now

713
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:34,810
said now so well I guess I'd appeal if I
really would

714
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,740
I don't think

715
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,440
I don't think the guy who answers the
phone there today say that but okay

716
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,080
and that this actually so in terms of
appealing all denials this gets to the

717
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,119
last two points

718
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,619
I'm fees when you're dealing with these
folks

719
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:57,510
be friendly courteous unreasonable talk
to the people working on your request

720
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,600
treat them as human beings you know

721
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,350
they are they are gimme it's easy to get
to see them into vilify them so they're

722
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,609
bureaucrats and whatever

723
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:10,160
and there's their incompetence that but
they're not actually there overworked

724
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,250
people right these these all these
agencies have

725
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,670
huge for your request you know the
people who are dealing with the foyer

726
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,369
are not the highest paid people in the
world

727
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:21,520
third trying their best Mike my personal
belief

728
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,369
and you get you know it's you catch more
flies with honey

729
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:30,490
right it a in just in talking to people
at one point I ever had a conversation

730
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,530
for the four analysts and and they don't

731
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,100
they're used to fire requesters being
not jobs

732
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,580
right seriously you know cycle oh yeah
and then the guy who requested 5,000 you

733
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,790
know times about UFO's or whatever right
and so as a result there really

734
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,420
leery of talking to the public and so
for the most part you don't end up

735
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,980
talking to them unless you call them

736
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:52,570
and at one point a this person was
handling my request said

737
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:56,160
or straps are you know it's really what
you're asking for here is

738
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,480
it's just really pretty much impossible
we can do the sensible will

739
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,480
week what is it you think I'm asking and

740
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,150
shit I think you you want this this this
should know what that's insane I would

741
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,020
never ask that this

742
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,220
a lot of work and there's a spas she's
like

743
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,590
we yeah

744
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,130
I said look but but look if I ever ask
for something that's unreasonable just

745
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,950
call me and tell me I don't know how
your system works if I'm asking for

746
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,070
something that saddam I expect you to
tell me and we can figure something out

747
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:26,980
and like she's my best friend now it's
like

748
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,260
you know and and so you know again it's

749
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,210
in its just like working with any big
organization have this and lacquers the

750
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,090
last point which is

751
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:38,510
keeper paranoia and check right it is so
easy

752
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,770
especially given the kinds of people who
tend to be in this particular room at

753
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,920
this particular time

754
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,550
right to say like oh you know the
government has millions of files on this

755
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,240
or that or

756
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,140
in particular on me and when they say no
records are just lying scum in this and

757
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,509
that you know

758
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,700
a hate to break it to you maybe they
don't have a file on you maybe they

759
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,619
don't have a file whatever is requested

760
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:03,160
but be even if they do and they're not
giving it to you and they say no records

761
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,000
is probably just because is not filed
the way that your request allowed them

762
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,960
to to find

763
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,369
really probably I see probably is not

764
00:41:11,369 --> 00:41:14,880
you know conspiracy every member of my
talking to somebody

765
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,340
about four and they said it's a
conspiracy and I said

766
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,490
left-wing or right-wing and and

767
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,910
missing the irony entirely they respond
instantly overarching

768
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,569
so

769
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,180
okay so

770
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,279
a couple a smile 5 not a couple

771
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,480
flat-tax and these are just some things
that some people have come up with that

772
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,300
I think you really particularly clever
they may or may not be useful to you but

773
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,720
I i think thats there

774
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,250
if nothing else funny please send me
copies of your agency's

775
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,800
intranet homepage every page link to the
home page

776
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,210
every page link to a page link to the
home page now

777
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,880
and as as and just it kinda the fasten
them out if you wonder what it would

778
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,910
have people at the Defense Intelligence
Agency see when they show up at work and

779
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:01,649
log into their

780
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,960
internal website everyday this kind of
an interesting thing that might give you

781
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,450
some ideas for other documents you wanna
fish around at

782
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,860
it also illustrates important thing
which is there's a certain amount of

783
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,280
negotiation goes on back and forth
between requesters

784
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,840
agencies and and you know so if you work

785
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,150
right to request in such a way that they
say gosh that's a lot of work we can't

786
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:21,670
do that

787
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,330
well okay what could you do well we can
give you a copy of our home page in the

788
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,480
pages that link to a but not that next
level down

789
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:34,480
okay you know um please send me copies
in the first 10 pages and files 165 HQ

790
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,760
1234 1235

791
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,490
did a right so sort of a little school
for sample or gold panning expedition

792
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,410
just to see what's in them get a sense
above

793
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:47,399
what's there this i think is a great
sort of meta

794
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,590
for a hack please send me a copy of your
for your request lock

795
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,910
right

796
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:57,029
when every time you make a request under
fire you know you show up in our quest

797
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:58,520
log which is in itself

798
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,250
oil ball sort and you know

799
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,640
I have occasionally been known to do a
vanity Google and found

800
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,759
my name in oil logs that are posted on
the web to some agencies will post them

801
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,369
it's like

802
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:17,190
branded as a nut job for life please
send me a copy of all administrative

803
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,460
records generated

804
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,820
related to my previously submitted for
your request number one two three four

805
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,780
five so this will be a case where

806
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,580
they said a no records and you didn't
think that was quite right maybe you

807
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:30,660
appeal may be one may be lost whatever

808
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,029
but wouldn't be interesting to see the
email correspondence back and forth

809
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,859
oh yeah is that nutjob Lapsley again
asking about phone phreaks

810
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:41,950
and enemy you can literally see emails
like that well

811
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:45,710
site not literally it didn't have my
name is there some other not cover

812
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:46,260
talking about

813
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,300
I'm this I also think it's a good one

814
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:53,700
its little bit tortured but please send
me a copy of all documents

815
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,280
that were initially considered to be
potentially responsive to my previous

816
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,690
request but that we're ultimately
determined to be non-responsive

817
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:05,310
so remember the example blue box I said
there are four files

818
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,839
three of which have to do with blue
teddy bears and one has to do with a

819
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,970
blue box this gets you the blue teddy
bears

820
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:13,619
I

821
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:17,760
alright so that's that's the foyer hacks
know what I'd like to do is spend us to

822
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,650
a couple minutes talking about some
interesting web sites that have come up

823
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,030
over last year

824
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,690
I'm that are all for your related in
some way and and which i think are cool

825
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,660
I'm this is kinda neat and it touches on
an important point so there's a website

826
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,220
called

827
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,599
Air Force history index dot work and
it's named I think in the same vein that

828
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,510
shredded wheat

829
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:39,310
is named it's not these guys are gonna
win awards for marketing

830
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:44,420
but it is a it is a searchable database
of 550,000 historical Air Force

831
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,160
documents and really it's not actually
documents themselves it's sort of like

832
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,270
the card catalog

833
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:53,240
now how did they get this database well
they fired in 2001

834
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,770
I a copy of the Air Force historical

835
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:01,349
agency afro a Air Force historical
research agency after a

836
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:05,800
I a copy of their database now and their
database is basically the others

837
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,160
this essentially electronic card catalog
all these 550,000 historical Air Force

838
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,368
documents that this Air Force agency
maintains

839
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:16,660
some other documents are classified but
the actual index the documents are not

840
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:20,109
makers within which is really cool about
four and we didn't talk about

841
00:45:20,109 --> 00:45:23,740
10 things that a amendment to fly in
1996

842
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,910
said it's called the e4 a laconic for
law says

843
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,618
that where ever reasonable to do so the
agency needs to give the requester the

844
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,060
documents for the records

845
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:36,460
in the form specified by the requester
so for example

846
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,800
if the documents exist electronically if
the electronic database

847
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,790
you can follow an electronic database
and say hey i'd like it on CD rom please

848
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:50,080
I like an com a separated values for
whatever i'd like searchable PDF ideally

849
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,359
um so that's what these guys did and
then another set of people who are more

850
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,680
technically savvy than the original
former Quester

851
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,960
made the searchable think it's really
cool so now you can do the searchable

852
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,119
keyword index and see all sorts of
amazing here for you don't actually see

853
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,930
the documents but you can see the actual

854
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,379
you know it's like a 1500 character
abstract which document has everything

855
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:09,310
to do with you know

856
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:13,839
from desert storm to the Wright brothers
to everything and it's just something

857
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:14,089
that

858
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:19,049
the public would not have access to it
were not for 4 a.m. I'm

859
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,349
this is one called TV show complaints
.org

860
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:26,820
and it allows you to it essentially is a
letter generator actually

861
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:30,880
email generator so if you were to click
on the Big Green Arrow it takes you to a

862
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,410
page where you can either select from a
drop-down list

863
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:37,190
here's the TV shows that I'm interested
in hi and it will then

864
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:41,140
gin up an email him stand put it up in
your in your email program if you have

865
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,680
it or allow you to copy pasted injured
email program

866
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,500
that you just send a four-year FCC got
curve simply send me all the complaints

867
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,980
that you've received regarding

868
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,339
Desperate Housewives and so it you know

869
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:56,549
all this is doing is its generating
those four sentences that we talked

870
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:59,190
about but it's doing it for you in a way
that you don't have to look up the

871
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:01,020
address or anything else it just goes on

872
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:04,960
engines up and sense of so it's I'm it's
a foil lubricant

873
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,570
if you will I'm related to that

874
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,730
get my FBI file do you have an FBI file

875
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:16,700
many people do up the

876
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,780
the you might have an FBI file if you
ever if you knew a guy named Joy the

877
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,589
horse never help to take out any heavy
garbage bags

878
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:27,170
but again this is Sam same idea right
which is adjusted generates a letter to

879
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,050
the FBI when things just cool about this

880
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:32,980
is you just check the boxes for field
offices you can check off 57 if you want

881
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,310
and it doesn't generates the

882
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:38,630
the letters that you need to mail off
get grandpa's FBI file

883
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:42,750
this is for if you know the subjective
your request is a deceased individual

884
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,089
and you can prove it you can use this
for for that

885
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:51,220
what do they know dot com is the UK
recently United Kingdom recently

886
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,450
did a a Freedom of Information Act law

887
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:57,910
similar to the US one and this is a
similar thing to that it allows you to

888
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,100
request online what school is the
responses get aggravated there so you

889
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,339
can see what are other people looking at
not just

890
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:07,619
what the reporter asking for but also
what the agency responded

891
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:12,390
government attic this is a rummaging in
the government's addict is

892
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,270
its or their motto but this is a catch a
place where people can submit

893
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,589
the kinda like the that previous one
about what do they know

894
00:48:19,589 --> 00:48:23,490
it's a here all the documents we got my
four yr and we post a minute everything

895
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,619
from four till August 2

896
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,900
you know just all sorts interesting
embarrassing sometimes funny government

897
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,410
documents

898
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:34,839
I want to acknowledge a couple people
before I take questions

899
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:38,710
one guy Michael Ravin its key if you
were to google him you find out that

900
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:39,130
he's

901
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,650
one of the most prolific for requesters
and he's actually the offer a lot of the

902
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,250
hacks that are presented here

903
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,300
really bright clever guy always willing
to help people if you have questions

904
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,619
about 40

905
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:53,070
I'm Scott Harris who is a formerly with
the department of justice as a foil

906
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:57,369
attorney and now in private practice he
as answer a number of questions for me

907
00:48:57,369 --> 00:49:01,170
and I want us to thank the staff for the
FBI for a department just called records

908
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,000
information dissemination

909
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,130
service reps they've been
extraordinarily helpful in teaching me

910
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:14,130
what I know about flair I'd love to take
questions

911
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:20,720
so the question is if you ask for your
own filed you get red flag

912
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,430
I don't know I I

913
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,839
I believe the answer is No I'll tell you
why I believe that and then

914
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,990
and then you can just believe me I'm the

915
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:35,100
again it comes down to

916
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:39,090
sort have the the for your group is
really very separate

917
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,780
and like in the case in FBI for example
which is what I know most about their

918
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,870
very separate from the operational after
the FBI remember one saying

919
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:49,160
a Goshen I'm sure you guys have better
things to do

920
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,480
then talk to me about oil I catch
terrorists and she's like oh hell let me

921
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,110
assure you we don't catch terrorists
here

922
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:57,170
at and where the former group I'm

923
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,440
so I mean it's conceivable but they they
state

924
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,090
that they do not and they're sort of no
real reason to think that they do

925
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:08,410
and I know that there have been people
who a who have requested their file and

926
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,240
then you know two years later requested
it again to see if there's anything in

927
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:11,960
there like a

928
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,690
requested his file two years ago but
this gets back to the paranoia had right

929
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:16,340
which is

930
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:20,350
well of course you'd expect that not to
happen right because if they were smart

931
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:21,390
they wouldn't tell you

932
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:25,250
so you know I can only tell you that
they say that they don't

933
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:28,930
and I haven't seen any evidence to
suggest that they do that doesn't prove

934
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:30,190
it because it's proving a negative

935
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,680
so site first at the microphone for
Skype

936
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,910
sector I'm about to file

937
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:42,020
request a Massachusetts under state law
similar to four and I believe the

938
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,940
records are

939
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,580
likely kept in backup database have been
deleted from the database that active by

940
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,290
policy

941
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,570
so my two questions were first do you
have any experience working with state

942
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:56,650
under state laws and second is a
reasonable to request record-setter only

943
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:57,600
captain backups

944
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,470
so let me answer the second question
first which is totally reasonable to

945
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,220
request

946
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,840
that things are back up again if you can
reasonably reason we describe it

947
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,750
I'm if you know if it was so archival
that it was actually like

948
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,500
you know on you know petroglyph
encrusted stoner something they could

949
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:15,920
say gosh that's too much work

950
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,060
but if it's just on backup tapes
absolutely on

951
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:23,390
I do you have experience working with
some state stuff but not massachusetts

952
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,930
on most state laws are vaguely modeled
on

953
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,110
the the federal foyer but only vaguely

954
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:33,120
there is a mailing list call Foye dash L

955
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,020
I and i think is run out of Syracuse but
if you just google for F ally daschle

956
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:37,770
mailing list

957
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,509
there incredibly helpful group of people
and if you post there and say exactly

958
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,360
what you just said you get three or four
response to people saying

959
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,420
oh yeah and the records clerk you want
to talk to is Joe Blow

960
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,800
so thank you good luck um person

961
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:57,800
in the back you yes thank you

962
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,350
so the question was given that so much
of our government is being outsourced to

963
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,990
private contractors how to spoil plan to
that

964
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:24,290
and and can we get access to it and I
would answer that question but it's a

965
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:26,470
trade secrets exempt under before

966
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,340
so II no sorry I don't mean to make
light that if this is a great question

967
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,510
I don't know what the answer is it's
just not something that I've dealt with

968
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,120
on if they want yeah I think it's a a
big concern

969
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,020
I share the concern and it would be a
great thing to pose to the FO I L

970
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,300
mailing list to get out a better answer

971
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,090
it certainly could be

972
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:50,950
I don't and you know you asked about the
question have could be outsourcing

973
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:54,610
you know in the case of the FBI I don't
think it is

974
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,870
in the case of CIA or NSA or whatever it
it might be

975
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:01,520
am it but in a lot of those cases those
are gonna be exempt from disclosure for

976
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,370
other reasons

977
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:09,370
so yes

978
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:18,200
0 this so what is a backup tape just
just on a computer right when you do

979
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:18,539
your

980
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:21,910
your backup if you're backing up your
computer's hard drive and you put it on

981
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:22,190
a

982
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:29,190
on a tape right like on a magnetic tape
for something

983
00:53:30,530 --> 00:53:34,320
its gonna vary from one agency to
another um

984
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,550
in the case to the FBI I don't mostly
FBI records or paper

985
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:41,840
their their computer system has been a a
well-documented a bottle from

986
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:46,230
you know so it's a so I don't have to
worry about that just yet for the FBI

987
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,790
so yes I have much freedom

988
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:53,550
do we have to redistribute public
responsive received

989
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,940
where Wes Patriots database

990
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,100
the actual documents things like that
among the for a non-commercial purpose

991
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:05,370
yet it I think you have total freedom
it's a it's a it's a public document

992
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,720
so other

993
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,900
question here Mike so you mention that
they are they

994
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,360
review the documents that the go through
before they destroy them

995
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,590
do is the to the Dubai historical
significance is there

996
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:22,920
I'm yes so you're saying review before
destroy yeah the retention yes and so

997
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,490
there is

998
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:28,400
a.m. they created a a document retention
plan with the National Archives

999
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,230
and it says for different categories of
documents which one should be reviewed

1000
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:36,600
and based on the subject like for
example civil rights stuff the FBI has

1001
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,280
been retained

1002
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,060
thats important you know garden-variety
fraud not so much

1003
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:44,180
there's a theory in document retention
called the fat file three which is good

1004
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,810
for files big fat dick

1005
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,070
it's probably important so but yet they
do

1006
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:54,520
thanks I want to ask you talkin bout dem

1007
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,200
you know the various categories that
determine how you how you get

1008
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,970
how much you have to pay now feels and
wondered how how hard is it to

1009
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:06,300
a make to to get yourself consider
credentials as a part of the news media

1010
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,370
it like it if you work commissioned to
do an article for

1011
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:14,120
a for 2600 we are you be in the news
media

1012
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:18,049
yet so um so let me answer that in
several different ways

1013
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:21,280
the short answer is I don't think it's
that hard and I think for example in the

1014
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,610
case at 2600 you have a pretty good shot
at it

1015
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,350
um and a I think it ends up getting
handled on a case by case basis

1016
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,990
frequently if you say I'm a member the
news media

1017
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,950
you might include some additional stuff
be on that assertion right I write for

1018
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,370
2600 here's a clipping up an article
ever written

1019
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:40,680
you know something like that the other
thing I didn't mention I should've

1020
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:44,120
is even if you are a.m. a

1021
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,490
in one of the few categories you can
request a fee waiver

1022
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:50,300
so you can say yeah I know I'm an
individual I know it's for

1023
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,850
non-commercial purposes but let me tell
you what I'm going to do with the data

1024
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,299
and here's why I think you should charge
me a fee

1025
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:58,390
and if you type in for a fee waiver to
do well you'll find lots of good stuff

1026
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,629
but how to do that

1027
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:03,590
um so but the answer is it shouldn't
it's not that hard most the time

1028
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,960
so why did you do that with the and I
say when you

1029
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,010
they said they were Treasury 0 it's one
of those things where

1030
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:15,250
you know I you I probably could have
ginned up some excuse but it was the

1031
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,310
sort of thing where

1032
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,620
okay you know that's just more trouble
on this opportunity cost I could be

1033
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,880
doing something else with my time

1034
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:27,880
so and can non-u_s_ citizens do for your
request absolutely non-u_s_ citizens can

1035
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,400
do for work was there any other extra
hurls

1036
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,770
Gus you must cover I'm sorry are there
any other hurdles

1037
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,840
look will send in the request thank you
okay and

1038
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,180
being told to stop so thank you very
much come talk to me after
