we shall proceed to expel you from the
internet and systematically dismantle

7
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,170
the Church of Scientology in its present
form

10 we'll take this place we are
cognizant of the many who decry our

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,460
methods is parallel to those at the
church of scientology

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,720
those who espouse the mysteries that
your organization will use the actions

19
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,189
of anonymous as an example if the
persecution of which you have for so

difficult to maintain

25
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:35,280
believers will become aware that
salvation needn't come at the expense of

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,450
their livelihood

27
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,259

130
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,180
on the reagan invaded each other

131
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,200
up some cheesy internet thing and you
know soon be there in like a run in

132
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,010
fuckin message each other's boards go on
so maybe Encyclopedia Dramatica change

133
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,750
in trees but people just the stupid

134
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,870
but the thing is I just so happen to all
be happening at the same time

135
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,240
you know well as these are ones going to
bother another another was gonna go

136
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,010
bother another

137
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,529
this was the really cheesy in Steuben I
really was gonna get involved at all

138
00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:17,349
but it just so happened at around that
same time is one hour tom cruise video

139
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:18,039
came out

140
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,560
are you familiar with that on those
elite

141
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,440
video with Tom Cruise acne complete a
retard

142
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,979
ahead basically making Scientology will
take months if I can say goes

143
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,120
and so they came out on YouTube and then
it got taken down

144
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,440
because the church likes to have
copyright infringement crap and

145
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,159
Josue people and you know there is the
ball you too but taking it down

146
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,300
it would do stuff like this on the
internet for a while it pissed a lot of

147
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,670
people off and just so happen to have
never really really unfortunate time

148
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,010
because

149
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,380
everybody was gearing up to do some
ridiculous shit to each other

150
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,810
on so what happened was

151
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,410
everybody decides to go in start the bug
the shit as Scientology now

152
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,300
on every chain board every message board
that really had the same kind a jerk

153
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,529
soon all the internet our

154
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:07,670
you know slaying the internet things
everybody knew about

155
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,430
you know everybody was like okay let's
all go and you know that I have a

156
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,180

fuckin sending the fax over and over and

220
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,839
over again

221
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,980

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,680
it's the only just deserve I'll but you

224
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,089
and

225
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:00,100
sewn any case us

226
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,699
they got they have had their kind
bombarded with that for a little while

227
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,750
on I'm really the 18th you can get on
any other sites because they were

228
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,470
overloaded

229
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,410
on yeah and we had people on now I
received the US in there

230
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,689
the web sites which is also free
juvenile knowing what you now see using

231
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,800
dissident script kiddies and whatnot but
Dom

232
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,790
yeah when the main purpose is the the I
seen everything we had going

233
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:25,790
was stung school money main purpose is
no

234
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,949
a have the IRC network originally was
actually the DDoS other web sites

235
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,930
and down they actually had a few as I
said dynamics website they had their

236
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,220
more recruiting website nails other main
website and I think we had their website

237
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,240
Africa record is almost two weeks

238
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,740
um maybe

239
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,620
yeah well became me there was

240
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,240
there was most I think it was down in a
row was public 3 desert and the thing

241
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,920
with the republican issues with upper
body work on the screen get down

242
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,130
um but I think welcome

243
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,660
whatever was on the 18th everything was
down right lines were completely clogged

244
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,610
the faxes they shut them off for about
two weeks

245
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,630
a if then a

246
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,819
you know everything's kind I'm down a
member right around the

247
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,089
you know 1920 if you know everyone's
kinda petering out you see

248
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,339
participation decreasing stuff like that
and a

249
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,689
with the decision was made I guess a to
have a second wave

250
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,899
I she wrote that copy pasta

251
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:31,319
for second wave and a you know I I had
sent out and I promise I want to focus

252
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,160
more on a

253
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,949
on some press involvement to so I kinda
threw a lot at in there

254
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:39,439
and I mean nobody really ever had the
area time any idea

255
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:42,649
you know who I was with the fuck I was
doing but arm

256
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:46,069
basically if like I said before if you
write something up you know you put it

257
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:46,790
on the board

258
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,050
where you put it where everybody's you
see it has a good fucking idea

259
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,439
you know so you get a years ago adopted
into it so

260
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,269
that's kinda what happened um

261
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:00,139
those another wave after that of course
and another and another and it just kept

262
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:00,839
going on

263
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,350
and our what something interesting
happened at that time I think on the

264
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,160
NRC's

265
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,089
the people start know each other because
a

266
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:13,120
you know what stuff that wants us to go
around for

267
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,069
you know for a long enough time in
people using aliases they'll stick to

268
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:17,199
one alias eventually

269
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,730
so so you know you did have some people
getting favor you know some ideas in

270
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,020
favor from some people

271
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,480
some I did not favor from other people
you know

272
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,709
and I guess that's kinda how I got to be
a part of

273
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,360
would eventually would be a channel want
what channels were all the kind of urs

274
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,040
and people who got were a little bit
more respected got into arm

275
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,020
and I was the major centralization in
the beginning of anonymous

276
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,059
than actually on my birthday on January
27th

277
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:49,360
um smart bunker put out his his video to
a

278
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,970
2 p.m. is tell us that this is not the
way to beat scientology yes I to calm

279
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,800
the fuck down

280
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,350
she has to stop doing stuff they could
you know potentially be considered

281
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,260
illegal

282
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,920
you know and you guys gonna handle it
that way arm

283
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,329
of people thought that are more but was
just had become a target never was going

284
00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:07,140
to a

285
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,309
you know going maybe bomb his Satan you
know do whatever but

286
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:14,429
you everybody kind members mark bunker
um

287
00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:17,600
and its he actually was what led to

288
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,019
the ire see Exodus as I they call it arm

289
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:25,170
the operas on a on the ICE network that
we're using

290
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,670
one of which in a minute which is in
repair I am

291
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,819
they'll actually kicked off everybody

292
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:36,870
everybody all the nonce for use in the
that server at the time

293
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,089
were gone and those whose couple
thousand people

294
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:43,420
and now we're thinking well how the fuck
Munich elaborate how important this is

295
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,319
really bad

296
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,559
let alone lasted three hours because
while we were gone

297
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:51,719
to Nexus we all pretty much decided that
paid we have to relax with the legal

298
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,910
shit because one

299
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,319
we can't do it anymore and to you know

300
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,649
Mark Munger had a lot of points

the morning attend because I'm wondering
with these are people gonna be like

310
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,860
these people who for so long if I said
even the slightest thing that they

311
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,880
disapproved with

312
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,120
will jump wat the fuck down my throat
and be incredibly incredibly mean

313
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:50,350
and on you know when I met up with them
for sale that's when I was fucking huge

314
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,980
nobody thought I was going to use in
just in your city owns around for

315
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,149
hundreds of people

316
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:58,280
you know we had planned February 10th in
every fucking major city worldwide

317
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,750
im so just to be just the New York again
fucking over 300 people understand

318
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,040
really well this is this is fuckin
massive

319
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,418
I had no idea you know and a

320
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,860
so I get there and people are just
fucking pool

321
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:15,470
they're funny as fuck nobody could get a
single freeze out without some other

322
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,200
asshole saying something completely
ridiculous

323
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,340
like everything was just a complete joke
and I'm like wow

324
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,959
everybody's like everyone was the bad
kid in class you

325
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,470
fake this if this is class everyone's
just a bad kid in class there's no

326
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,429
fucking teacher and we're just going
crazy

327
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:34,590
%um um there was the code of ethics
everybody knew in a fucking relax don't

328
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,500
fucking step out into the street if the
cops are not to the point anybody in the

329
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,480
fucking face

330
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,570
other than that you know I'm we were
chatting daycare sometimes

331
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,020
for him whatever I started the day care
on

332
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,500
but fuckin both you know

333
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,330
I just thought it was fucking great our
and local era before the 10th

334
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,620
are we already had the idea months
already planned

335
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,169
which was the 15th you know i i axons me
a firm believer in a few gonna go in a

336
00:19:01,169 --> 00:19:04,110
and jump into something maybe like the
first thing should always have the

337
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,429
backup thing there

338
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:08,540
so that you know if it does become a
success you very much like a are let's

339
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,710
do this again then

340
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,360
you know then you have the same Turner
um

341
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,510
so we did and I guess the whole point of
this was for me to tell you how and why

342
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,340
scientology got my name in such more
during those first two raids

343
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,820
those first two protests they could see
that I was a

344
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,020
you know i think is a liaison with you
must feel you you know I was

345
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,610
kinda run around the front runner you
know help organize stuff from whatever

346
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,550
and they obviously saw that

347
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,010
my very flimsy Groucho Marx the skies
didn't do a fucking thing

348
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,870
if well most in Sevilla

349
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,929
biking and and and that's actually how
they got me

350
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,409
they're probably farming homer some
ridiculous fucking thing like that in

351
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,440
and that's pretty much it so now they
know my name

352
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,870
the semi also it's a fucking letters and
stuff like that in a I'm def not gonna

353
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,710
go into work is the shit is way too
fuckin funny to me

354
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,580
but i wanna be Prince keeping the
pressure on we got a lot of luck in

355
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,350
Press

356
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:05,800
they look more more fucking ridiculous
all time and we just beat them up by

357
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,649
being

358
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:10,720
fuckin funny insane weird shit that's it

359
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,750
they keep

360
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:17,760
summer particularly want to pick it up
for

361
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,200
with your exploration up

362
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,000
pokies on latest government ok you know
what's up

363
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,030
yes yes it's it's appropriate
adjustments NASSCOM

364
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:34,490
now yen yep

365
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,889
yea yeah they can't find where I live
twice so

366
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:44,010
I don't give a damn a yes

367
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,340
are not really gonna talk about family
involvement in scientology

368
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,540
I can talk a little bit about that if he
want after the panel but our

369
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,570
like Adam question-answer session talk a
little bit about bad shit they do

370
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,320
how they really trillion lines and in
all that on fun stuff but right now

371
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,280
we're gonna keep along the fun side so

372
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,309
on the start of by saying some things
that I have written down

373
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,510
and reading them with my own eyes so

374
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,429
sour you know I think we've been here
nice today because

375
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:20,120
a now Fox News said that were bunch of
hackers on steroids

376
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,210
that was 2007 a

377
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,490
they also call this the internet hate
machine that's a nice on

378
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:33,010
and the they they recommend strongly
that if you buy curtains and a dog you

379
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,929
can really protect itself against
hackers

380
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:38,740
that's a good one I i think that we
should all do this

381
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,260
are also known for exploding yellow vans
according to them though yeah

382
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,809
well this is a report murdoch network so
you know it's true

383
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,020
I love for the most part a lot that
tech-savvy um

384
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,460
certainly not less crowded I'm sure all
view

385
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,250
holy surpassed me in every way but you
know

386
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,450
I guess I'm just Tomball

387
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,010
on allowing the party the internet hate
machine I only joined up with anonymous

388
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:09,710
as chin ology started so call me
anonymous comments knowledge is

389
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,649
if you're into that semantics go have a
a fun by yourself

390
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:17,760
I'm gonna be with these guys on

391
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,500
I really don't know what anonymous
wasn't till the until I saw the first

392
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,570
message scientology video that we played
just before

393
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,330
I heard about them once in passing over
the years but

394
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,678
I'm I wasn't a huge internet user I'll

395
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,320
just sort of the I don't know normal kid
grown-up

396
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,980
and the you know I got my AOL CDs and

397
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,159
then drink coasters over the years and
like the early nineties

398
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,530
but for the most part no I have heard
about an honest once when they

399
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,750
sort have made news not even the Fox
News report when the

400
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,820
up when an honest way back when deciding
you catch them had a file because they

401
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,158
thought it was funny

402
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,710
and as it turns out it was I was also
awesome so

403
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,909
you know we ate them up on

404
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:09,460
I if

405
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,800
your deck you make a solid
crime-fighting

406
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,919
alright that man come down I L

407
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,570
of I was so very literally Robin the
goggles those for you

408
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,020
was berated edelman your you seventy

409
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,050
your you

410
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:32,450
occasion up and I'm cool okay

411
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,580
so really were a buncha communist Nazi
cyber terrorist

412
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,949
aliens from the market in Empire being
paid by the psychiatric industry to

413
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,990
protest

414
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,010
in order to force the homosexual agenda
and make sure that alien goes for men

415
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,500
imprisoned your honor

416
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:52,500
gots

417
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,119
alright are all those things I think
that the Church of Scientology said

418
00:23:56,119 --> 00:23:57,540
about us

419
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:01,309
I couldn't like this because I don't
think that unless I was wasted several

420
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,658
times over I could come up with
something that dumb

421
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:07,940
these are things that the members
believe because these people have been

422
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,639
totally stripped of their rationale

423
00:24:10,639 --> 00:24:14,450
now thanks maybe later I am but the

424
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:19,090
these people I mean truly have no sense
of critical reasoning

425
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,139
it's something that's taken away from
them at some point and its

426
00:24:22,139 --> 00:24:25,320
it's really sad because it pervades into
other areas of life

427
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,210
including medicine which you know has
killed people in the past

428
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,520
because they were few psychiatric care
and

429
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,629
maybe get into that a little bit later
but you know

430
00:24:35,629 --> 00:24:39,550
here in New York City Jennifer McDonald
Cox the nice woman who

431
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,619
the came out from the Scientology church
which the corners

432
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,559
public gonna talk a lot and jargon here
because Scientology's all jargon

433
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,460
that's part of a part much hope of
mentality to begin with

434
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,760
so when you're inside I you know what
you're talking about

435
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,200
you feel like you on the club everybody
has the same words

436
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:02,119
and as an outsider you don't now sell
apologize for all of us if we start

437
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:03,119
talking and

438
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,840
in gibberish mom buyer to Jennifer
McDonald pass this woman with a mouth

439
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,149
like a song like pet

440
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:13,020
comes outta comes out and yells at Mike
here

441
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,600
and she was implement foreign

442
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:20,000
Buffalo covering up Jeremy Perkins

443
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,610
to on very unfortunately is paranoid
schizophrenic

444
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,710
who his mother al perkins a
Scientologist

445
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,710
and as becoming scientologist

446
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:35,820
was tonight psychiatric care and because
she was told that the psychiatrists are

447
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,200
evil aliens from the marketing Empire as

448
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,450
we are of course move

449
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,809
was told take the some of the medication
Ange he

450
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,020
ended up stabbing her seventy times

451
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,658
and Jennifer mcdonnell parks was
implement all was a

452
00:25:52,659 --> 00:25:56,649
big part of covering up these people are
criminals

453
00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:00,500
was no other way around um

454
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,649
but back to some fun stuff you know

455
00:26:04,649 --> 00:26:08,080
because I said I was gonna do that and
the you know these people

456
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,530
these people are criminals I get I got a
little pissed off because I think that's

457
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,030
the right thing to do

458
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,950
because you know if nobody gets pissed
off a criminal's the just gonna

459
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,460
keep on keepin on because the stuff
doesn't get coverage

460
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,820
because these people are other exactly
for that purpose to cover this stuff

461
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,189
a runoff about the tracks I'm

462
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,070
really I'd like to talk a little bit
about if you see yesterday

463
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,480
you want to get involved with us because
a as in Tower

464
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,270
pretty much the you know pretty much a
buncha will be jerks

465
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:47,300
yeah arm I mean I that's a great
description of us because

466
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:51,619
we were kinda means each other helping
each other injure

467
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:54,780
right want enough

468
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,480
know you I like them the season

469
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,610
and the you know if you want to join up
with us

470
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,780
just don't take anything seriously
honestly I

471
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,158
you can do it for whatever the reason
you want you can do it because you

472
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,580
pissed

473
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,550
good reason you can do it because
scientology is a criminal organization

474
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,350
with the tax exempt status and

475
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,210
you're paying for them you can do it
because they've covered up murders

476
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,119
you can do it because they abuse
children

477
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:29,129
consistently whatever you can do it
because it's a lot of fun

478
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:33,809
some people just like to come out with
us and party were

479
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,950
we do worldwide protest monthly we do

480
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,179
weekly protests

481
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:47,179
physically think we're doing his
physical store real world

482
00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:50,820
we've we've made some pretty serious
effects

483
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,899
in especially in in terms I love I give
a press coverage of the a Scientology

484
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:57,000
organism

485
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,600
diseased

486
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,240
there has been a few people in New York

487
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,559
who have previously been scientologists
to

488
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,019
were not too afraid to speak out against
the church of scientology because they

489
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:13,909
know if the

490
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:17,460
for Chas blackmailing policies against
the Church of Scientology

491
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,850
the members because when you undergo
counseling in the Church of Scientology

492
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,799
the write down everything

493
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:26,870
and this is for something quick call PC
file

494
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,480
and this is something that will use
against you if you leave

495
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,409
and because I've our presence there have
been

496
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:38,919
%uh you members were scientologists to
have found a voice again and are willing

497
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,110
to speak up

498
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:44,309
this is New York City locally

499
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,860
yeah I personally had somebody blow

500
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,279
which is what the call leaving from
talking to me yes

501
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,490
and we have a we accept a couple people
dead

502
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,740
one of them explode for now he actually

503
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,539
end up leaving not to lie yeah and he
comes down protesters all-time

504
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,720
an easy if you look around one for
protest he makes himself very very

505
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,580
obvious

506
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,309
he runs around with with an iPod
speakers strapped to his bell

507
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:13,010
%ah which the iPod's learning out the

508
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:16,470
the call the OT three on which
apparently

509
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,870
if I if you hear it and you're not
actually upset lovely yield I have

510
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:24,570
among the most anything like that now
according to scientology

511
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,350
basically violence speaking of which I
mean because as some

512
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,779
so if I believe years ago I the evil
galactic Overlord you too

513
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:35,549
another call about overpopulation on a
small planet decided to round up all the

514
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,120
aliens aliens

515
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,090
prospectuses a little olive me what the
so

516
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,820
you get the so this old yeah we've also
we've we've made sure that our

517
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,309
a lot of people actually what stirs the
pot places down a fucking lot worldwide

518
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:51,440
in locally

519
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,120
are we've made a lot of people wall more
than a

520
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,330
more than I as usual not join up David
they would try and talk to people all

521
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,418
around just would not fucking happen

522
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:04,870
there their membership is down their
monies down with premature them in

523
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,870
almost every fucking way

524
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,419
so how much membership cost them

525
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,620
almost everyone who said these
calculations that I've done by

526
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,929
interviewing every single scientologist
that's in the Oregon completely making

527
00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:17,250
up right now

528
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:21,110
I actually I'll we had very reports

529
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,700
I mean I i've heard that they were down
fucking forty percent I don't believe it

530
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,720
I I'm I think it's way more round 10 to
20

531
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,240
and their membership is on the slow to a
halt as far as i'm new sign-ups

532
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,710
and terms in whose wide

533
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,620
the in actuality a have was somewhere in
the

534
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,610
100,000 19 they say are fighting over a
hundred thousand I think you know they

535
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,570
say over eight million dollar a rancher
and the other day I'll say a

536
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:50,480
something else on the other they say
something else but we think it's

537
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,850
anywhere between fifteen hundred
thousand

538
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,909
they say a million because anybody who's
ever taken a stress test go karts

539
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:57,450
industry

540
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:02,019
everybody both maybe never walk New York
they can City scientologist

541
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:06,100
he's like unclean such ridiculous
numbers ever taken stresses on the

542
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,610
street

543
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:09,610
your scientologist there honestly I'm a
Scientologist

544
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:14,539

545
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:18,529
this is one other little camping spots
they do them stress St Ann's

546
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:22,000
apparently what they consider you one
when they consider you a

547
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,639
a member even if you're not actually

monarch famous a

566
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:32,429
the area for yet so

567
00:32:32,429 --> 00:32:35,940
as well as a you guys are making a big
impact on him I'm from Miami Florida

568
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,779
appearing to upcycle federal check the
comm we have you paid so

569
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:42,330
you know I've been covering you know
where you guys have been doing adding

570
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,860
stuff to your YouTube age is a favor

571
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,039
and people have been contacting me in
like West Palm Beach

572
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:51,820
you know in north Florida which is you
know where Scientology's base that I've

573
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,600
and they're talking about family members
being seriously involved in mind control

574
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,220
need a break and it's not just
scientology also in a different other

575
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,830
courts a lot of them are like the

576
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,190
aged Aquarius say folks %uh the New Age

577
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,260
nyanza mean it's my controls in the
robbing them blind side

578
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,389
you know that this is Vance often so I
called this makes money for committed to

579
00:33:12,389 --> 00:33:15,559
I'm and a certain people it's destroying
lives

580
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,760
um but at a question must see or get
this is something when I was researching

581
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,260
cuz view with the way you guys are doing
a

582
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,200
like a they have enable a force called
CEO word

583
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,809
the actually have a naval ship with with
an army

584
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:33,658
how the fuck is that legal named they
consider the naval ship

585
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,850
its really just for decoration well it's
a cruise ship for the blue asbestos

586
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,279
yeah it was recently shut down because
after

587
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,649
something like twenty years after the
fact they investigated the ship the

588
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,409
structural designer architect some sort
of naval engineer

589
00:33:50,409 --> 00:33:54,240
came onto the boat said you gotta shut
this down as for blue asbestos

590
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,320
twenty years later they actually had to
go in and get a government check and

591
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,230
guess what they found

592
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,450
as follows: Luis pass this so

593
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,750
you know doesn't just go away know
either visitors pass passes there isn't

594
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,379
a single Marcus Mojo

595
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:13,429
in your lungs is basically guarantee
cancer ten years down the line

596
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:16,549
they've threaten the lives %uh

597
00:34:16,549 --> 00:34:20,399
hundreds and thousands of their members
and they haven't told anybody about this

598
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,418
100 said that s passes is not bad for
your home

599
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:28,250
yes also the cigarettes are a great way
to prevent lung cancer

600
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,699
that's why so many signs of a smoke by
the way

601
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,770
if they're not telling you not to do
anything because you're talking about

602
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,319
him

603
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:41,020
that's something also nice amis this is
a quick tension because

604
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,480
I've really strayed far from when I was
gonna talk about behind to

605
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,759
11 times approximations something that
the

606
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:52,560
is a new one that I learned about only
maybe about a month

607
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,129
maybe month and a half ago something
that they love to do around

608
00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:00,690
disaster sites including our very own
9/11 disaster site

609
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,759
is they will use their volunteer
ministers

610
00:35:03,759 --> 00:35:08,089
which is a for thats you'll see them in
yellow shirts

611
00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:12,350
I'm and the calm and your ministers

612
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:16,970
they register the Volunteer Ministers at
the 9/11 disaster site and

613
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,560
New York as the National Mental Health
Assistance

614
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,160
which arm in the heat of the moment
sounded

615
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,569
remarkably close to the National Mental
Health Association which is a real

616
00:35:27,569 --> 00:35:28,700
organization

617
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,790
that's not scientology however they
register the Volunteer Ministers of

618
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:35,060
national mental health assistance

619
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,210
and they intentionally blocked 9/11
rescue workers and victims from

620
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,430
receiving free psychiatric care

621
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,620
because they believe psychiatry is evil
they would

622
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,670
literally take members up their church

623
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:51,220
and tell them all this is very important
and

624
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,660
something to keep in mind scientologist
generally exceptionally good people

625
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:58,990
who are horrendously misguided Tom

626
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,359
to calling up the entire New York area
membership

627
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:05,980
anybody problems ever come in and saying
come on this is

628
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:10,279
a national crisis get the hell down here
and he's a good people so they do

629
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:13,740
and they would literally pain of
psychiatrists

630
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,060
with the members so that no rescue
workers could get

631
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:23,790
care because they believe it even and
even the psychiatrist in the Holocaust

632
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,640
yeah many in short they believe
psychiatrist responsible for the

633
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,089
holocaust so that's

634
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:31,819
you know their history is really on 'em

635
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:35,490
speeches been derailed yes speeches not
been derailed

636
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,930
on and in the meantime they told them to
go to the Scientology knocking on

637
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:40,970
centers

638
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:44,600
to get the purification rundown which
involves taking

639
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,069
attacked those are nice and for your
liver that's always something good if

640
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:48,940
you have

641
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,170
and detox farm loans but it does have
nice and not cause flushing in the skin

642
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,240
tell you that radiation leaving the body
that's a nice why they tell you is your

643
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,670
damaging your liver permanently on

644
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,930
and this is just that they're going to
rescue workers and

645
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:09,669
you know just breaks my heart and makes
the past and the

646
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:12,960
I think it shouldn't make you please do
because this is ridiculous

647
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,109
was not something that we want going on
anywhere let alone in our city

648
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:20,560
I'm I was gonna talk about if the

649
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,470
you want to come out with us sometime
because were out often

650
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:27,620
and we usually in New York because

651
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,799
because we have so much fun we like each
other so much we go out just about every

652
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:31,759
week

653
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:36,830
probably every Saturday sometimes
midweek sometimes a few times a week

654
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:41,390
the occasional miss a week but there's
always a monthly worldwide protest I

655
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:41,670
think

656
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,000
event and the upon

657
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,630
you know if you if you just come in
there blindly might be a little bit

658
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,509
surprised

659
00:37:48,509 --> 00:37:52,040
might be a little bit shocked by serving
me know the language certainly hearing

660
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,359
us today

661
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:57,330
on aiding understands the relationship
you might think that we all hated each

662
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,299
other

663
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:01,839
arm that's only the case sometimes

664
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,400
especially after we just ship back up
from washington DC

665
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,029
because we were marching on the mall and
I we spent a lot of time with each other

666
00:38:09,029 --> 00:38:10,140
so

667
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,520
you know unlike these guys so much at
the moment well I do in the gym

668
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,150
you weren't there but I don't like you
anyway I still like broken on

669
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:22,490
your email il-sung

670
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:26,740
also yes he did he just heard as you
think that we're

671
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,200
relief crass and food and

672
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,680
confusing and and you'll be right

673
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,740
and you would be 100 percent correct yea

674
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,810
we r are the difference is that there's
absolutely no

675
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:46,350
no hateful intentions behind this the
stuff that's done mostly for shock value

676
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:50,339
I think this comes how does sorta the
internet

677
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:53,390
I'll when the itself to anonymity

678
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,660
in in its forms just in that then

679
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:01,379
sure and then that their web forms and
the

680
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:05,650
looks like I'm running over but that's
what happens when you jerks started

seventies and up yeah exactly

777
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:36,049
K we can never works they always they'll
have to do is to auditing and shit

778
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:39,589
says why would you want to yeah
alteration I don't know

779
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:42,990
I'm just say would it be possible I'll
yeah more or less I mean they would have

780
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:43,549
to like

781
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:46,859
confirm it was auditing in all sorts of
bullshit but if you just walk especially

782
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:49,890
now after like with them all up in arms
about us they would know that you just

783
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,029
fucking with them

784
00:44:51,029 --> 00:44:54,609
okay I covered by would be they keep
their word

785
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,480
obligations Graham X in point make it
worse

786
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,950
that's it means

787
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,020
ironworks did you guys hear about the
circus findings

788
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,900
no tell us um they weren't hands

789
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,079
I hey

790
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,740
girls

791
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,900
that's it wasn't for me

792
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,410
make this isn't a curious if anyone has
a copy if 33 with them today because I

793
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,390
kinda like to see how many signed

794
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,618
I gonna hate them all thanks it's okay
it's

795
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:37,460
yeah I think I after have turned the
issue with that is that

796
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,150
I anybody that they would send here
today Wooden's

797
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:44,829
be affected by that because they know
that we talk about it I

798
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:48,010
what they have is something real like
I'm gonna say

799
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,390
their told to look up any words they
don't understand they only told that she

800
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,180
knew was something from hubbard's crappy
crappy science fiction

801
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,529
that he wrote before the science section
which made him much more money

802
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,559
and a the issue is that their toll that

803
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,770
it was just something from that a fun
one if you wanted to fuck with them is

804
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:10,210
ask them to clear the work body dayton's
because that's something that's a inthe

805
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,300
within the OT 3.material: and that's
something that they don't have an answer

806
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,180
for

807
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:17,828

00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:40,609
I just wanna test to see if your if you
consider the possibility that your

814
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:44,040
in some ways showing for the psychiatric
establishment and the pharmaceutical

815
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,079
industry

816
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:50,050
and wondering if you are still uneven
refocus a left-wing iran denies any

817
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,920
tension and those guys solo no no no no
those guys are the real criminals

818
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,630
no they're not a Scientologist but
they're in the midst of apologizing the

819
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,300
full range of human experience

820
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:03,790
and they're targeting all people with
dementia less humid years

821
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:07,430
well I don't know about that they have a
much greater reach

822
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,578
%uh they have far more lobby our and
that they're killing people right now

823
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:17,589
well safe I'll true true please use it
as a sign in to YouTube has lots of the

824
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:18,828
doors

825
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:22,250
I don't think so by Tom I'd be really
interested in applying some your

826
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,040
techniques and energy to solving

827
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,529
some others really large problems okay
also once I get in a lot of ways we're

828
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:30,579
also not really an activist group was
just gonna run around reading all wrong

829
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:33,849
but we estimate but I'm the same like
you know anything's possible we could

830
00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:35,569
always direct it was all the things we
don't like

831
00:47:35,569 --> 00:47:38,730
well considering a measure we are
forcing their message for them

832
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,040
unit pharmaceutical industries work for
them by tagging some Scientology's

833
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,369
message because I have seen the truth
yeah I don't care where

834
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:50,369
were over so maybe you can get one last
question and then

835
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:54,690
up minimum ok it was a good one I gave
you a USB key just a few minutes ago I

836
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,390
passed it over and contains one picture
if you show to the people you see the

837
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,790
traffic statistics have seen you that
night and you will see what in fact I've

838
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:02,730
actually had

839
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,150
I yeah I ever I recall seeing at at
February 10th which is the anniversary

840
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,450
of police macpherson's there

841
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,980
that's a woman that very prominently
they just sort of watch

842
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,200
die I can tell the whole story now bada

843
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,940
they pretty much murdered a woman and
covered it up and the

844
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:23,250
after february tenth you can search the
traffic statistics there's an enormous

845
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,319
spike for searching

846
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,119
Lisa McPherson I think that a

847
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:32,280
Scientology's a virus and where
inoculating people

848
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,380
information will inoculate you against a
scam

849
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,900
and that's going on last question quick
all psychosis a comment and there's

850
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:40,980
actually an article

851
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,339
anonymous and on Maxim Maxim yeah

852
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:48,529
yeah at lead a pretty decent size
article to

853
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,650
yup that's when yes expect more and more

854
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:57,339
more in the future denies there yeah I
think this round of layoffs is now right

855
00:48:57,339 --> 00:49:00,390
yeah you of these days okay

856
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:06,339
splits say yes

857
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:07,109
yes
