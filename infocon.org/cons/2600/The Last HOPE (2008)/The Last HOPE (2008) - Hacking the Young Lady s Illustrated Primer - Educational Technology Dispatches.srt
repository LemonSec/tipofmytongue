1
00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:04,180
every panel discussion & talk is on DVD
shortly after

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,640
we recorded so and there something right
out there along with some t-shirts

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,960
downstairs they have fine caffeinated
beverages from Germany

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,450
that are non alcoholic but there's a
deli across the street as alcoholic

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,230
beverages

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:24,230
I'm

7
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,470
I should also mention that I just walked
by the Apple store in Soho and there's

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,019
still a line for the iPhone

9
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:42,570
it what's amazing is a few goes into an
AT&T store they haven't but is

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,570
you look you look much cooler stand in
line at the Apple Store

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,209
this panel is hacking the young ladies
illustrated primer dispatches from the

12
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,800
field in educational technology with
Jillian Gus Andrews

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,050
up Ivan Chris stick was supposed to join
the panel but got ill

14
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:19,050
so let's give it up for Joanne take your
on

15
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,580
so like he said my name is Julian Anders
must be known as Gus

16
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,570
I am a doctoral student in
communications and education at Teachers

17
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,369
College don't ask me how many years have
been there are how many I have left

18
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,229
because that is the legal question

19
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:39,210
on I A and when you talk a little bit
today

20
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,860
about my own stuff but also talk about
what ivan was gonna talk about because

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm really sad that he's not here on I
am. also worried that people with real

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,890
because he's really distraught he is the
former head of security for the One

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,290
Laptop Per Child project

24
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:56,520
and online fight and come talk with me
lies sort of casting about for somebody

25
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,619
to talk about educational technology
with because

26
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,440
he wrote what is probably the most
damning um

27
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,300
sorta right up love One Laptop Per Child
I've ever seen and from what I've heard

28
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,710
from the people who work there

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,970
it's got some teeth so I'm gonna

30
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,970
try to do what I can to do justice to

31
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,050
what I think ivan was gonna say before I
start my own stuff so if the party wants

32
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,740
right wing it I hope I don't
misrepresent I've in any way

33
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,120
I highly recommend that you go and check
out this post which is the first 1i saw

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,600
which is entitled sic transit gloria
laptops

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,769
on which is his post which is a great
title

36
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,910
on his post about on Laptop Per Child

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,940
so one of the first things he says and I
had not realize this was that there have

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,370
been

39
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,480
really a number love I 121

40
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,220
I laptop projects and several countries
and elsewhere

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,819
on and it was not Nicolas nigger pate
has been involved

42
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,670
in many of them and unfortunately we
have yet to see any success

43
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,740
so why not have a child is not really
the first project

44
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,300
ovitz tight and yet at the same time

45
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,520
one other things that Ivan brings up is
that we haven't really done a great

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,650
pilot study

47
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,950
on there's not really any good research
on how to make these

48
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:14,070
on programs Don Arthur is one that %uh
per child

49
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,239
maybe isn't paying so much attention to
them right now a

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,950
so Ivan doesn't that for a while I

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,150
for those are you sort of have not been
that from earlier without one Laptop Per

52
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,750
Child

53
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,170
on a big part of the sort of motivating
idea there we go we get people up in the

54
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,290
front with her with the XO's as they're
called

55
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,780
on because a little XO logo on the front
on

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,130
this is a you know child-size durable
laptop

57
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:41,799
a that this was to create a mesh network
on so it doesn't need a

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,690
hub to connect to the internet makes a
network either computers around it um

59
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,480
and what are the major things on that
sorta been driving this particular

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,510
iteration of one

61
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,299
to our laptops is a the idea of concise

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,150
dropped to fists constructionist sorry I
just two things this constructivist

63
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,550
learning and construction is warning

64
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,490
and constructionist learning as the idea
of us your paper and I T

65
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,650
on who invented the local was involved
in developing the local computer

66
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,410
language

67
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,950
on and the idea is basically that you
have children build

68
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,039
software and old programs that is how
they end up learning about computers and

69
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,690
so there is the sort of the first on
with this project as far as I understand

70
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,070
it

71
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,650
that they wanted to get kids not only to
use the super service features

72
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,880
up a computer but do what many of us did
which is actually

73
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,250
you know start from the command line a
lot of ways so they're hot they're

74
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,979
hoping receive a number features a
laptop which make it possible for kids

75
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:35,340
to get

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,770
in on love is that it's a lotta suffers
open source I know I've had people

77
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,930
with the give one get one project to
have gotten laptops for their kids in

78
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,259
the United States which is not actually
something you can do a mass right now

79
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,430
but if you buy one for kids another
country

80
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,380
you can get yourself and zon they always
come out when they go all you know my

81
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,870
little son so his arm

82
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,870
you know gone and she's tact this
particular video game and look she's

83
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,979
programming and I'm like that's great
but you also or the head of

84
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,139
your lawyer BFF so like now is she
really representative was gonna happen

85
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:08,880
project so um but anyway I mean so it's
one other the real ideas here is to

86
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
make 8 computer which is very accessible
its open source the operating system in

87
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,539
this case is non-proprietary it's called
sugar

88
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:18,590
on and that is one thing else that's

89
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,040
Ivan gets to in this blog post which I'm
talking about

90
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,430
um Ivan sort of took issue

91
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,540
eventually and I may be mispronounced
his name even I'm sorry I haven't met

92
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,180
the guy at

93
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,970
on but he

94
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,889
talks about the difficulty of using open
source software

95
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,650
I this physically open source operating
systems sonic space operating systems

96
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,780
and how

97
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,940
you know it's really fabulous you get to
tinker with things but not everybody

98
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,750
necessarily wants to and Ivan's for it
goes into something I'm sure a lot of

99
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,330
people

100
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,409
who are getting older and sort of just
don't like they have time anymore and I

101
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,190
know I am with

102
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,960
things I'm doing my life you know you
don't have time to tinker with things

103
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,090
you want them to sort just work out a
box and he saw a question whether

104
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,060
by giving people in onto Spanish
countries a lot of time

105
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,100
on these laptops that are you know that
they can't think it was that that really

106
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,940
what they want

107
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,550
on is that really what they need is that
the best way to support them getting

108
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,880
involved for the first time

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,340
this is open to debate on and there are
a number people at my laptop child to

110
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,880
say absolutely

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,550
that's something I think we can talk a
little bit more once I'm done here

112
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,610
um surviving goes on this artist do a
little he said she said

113
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,710
some email on that went back and forth
at the company and elsewhere

114
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,270
on including a letter from that Richard
Stallman use writing about

115
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,880
the fact that will not %uh per child
will soon be able to run Windows

116
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,169
I which is a relatively new developments
hands on a lot of people the open source

117
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,659
community from sort of like oh my god
what are you doing

118
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,190
and sana particular says you know
proprietary software keeps used by

119
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,840
helpless is functioning a secret Swiss
incompatible the skirt warning

120
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,180
a doesn't make the world a better place
to put children on the power systems

121
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,780
developer perhaps permanently

122
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,180
you might as well introduce the children
to an addictive drugs which item said oh

123
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,389
for fuck's sake

124
00:07:01,389 --> 00:07:04,480
you really just employed a silly
computer it comparing a proprietary OS

125
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,860
two addictive drugs

126
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,410
you know ones causing actual bodily harm
and possibly death released allman

127
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,160
really so that's just another that blog
post is an honest

128
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,760
so are the most incendiary thing and
maybe misrepresenting but talk about it

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,340
but is full of these really sort of you
know

130
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,010
any he's he's calling out some some
things that get said

131
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,159
in the open source community which i
think are worth thinking about a little

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,949
bit

133
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:29,820
um so let's see going on from there

134
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,580
%uh he talks about the grip on say and
so the things I dupont is said to him

135
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,680
mostly I think more or less privately
not even so much publicly

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,980
but 21-point implied to Chris sick I

137
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,580
he said you know this project is really
about getting laptops out

138
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,330
it's not about warning which I think I
don't says was the point at which she

139
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,580
decides with the project

140
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,440
I'm animes that you know makes a certain
measure cents a minute

141
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,669
if you when we watch this project is
this project we want to get technology

142
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:00,469
to people

143
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,199
I have a friend right now who's working
in the Himalayas and she was like going

144
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:05,449
to introduce

145
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:08,449
I laptops there for the first time and
she gets there and finds that there's

146
00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,850
already laptops before she got there so
you know there's there's issues like

147
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,430
that to think about i mean we can't
think ourselves from these great things

148
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,389
but

149
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:19,820
I'm they're not always were not always
necessarily on top for a game that way

150
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,159
I'm the major tick that Ivan levels in
this blog post

151
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,449
and i think is really critical is that
what %uh per child

152
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,780
has not itself my understanding is
really devoted

153
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:33,409
many resources to I deployment

154
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,019
and part is the One Laptop Per Child
model

155
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,339
my and my understanding I gotta tell ya
I'm not that close the project them onto

156
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:41,680
my understanding so is

157
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,970
is that this would've say we should turn
the community

158
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,980
on the community should help us to
things like this but Ivan says you know

159
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,420
to the best of his knowledge the plan
strategy consists of taking whatever

160
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,509
hotshot hacker

161
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:56,649
was not happened didn't have to be
working anything for all pissy at the

162
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,220
moment

163
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,110
and sending out into the field am saying
you know make his computer get out

164
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,690
people I'm so it's its for one thing
getting the computers out there but then

165
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,850
there's also the matter of training and
learning

166
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,170
and I understand there are number I'm
gonna do some TV training is going on

167
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,319
trial KC i've seen

168
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,199
sort of you talk about what's going on
in Peru and Uruguay and places like that

169
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,420
so

170
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,860
um a

171
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,990
but there are mean part of the saying

172
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,389
that really needs to be understood in
one of the things I think in

173
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:28,220
when we say you know there's no research
that's there's not much research has

174
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,889
been done on

175
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,160
onto playing a project like this 10
things we're saying is

176
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,689
on you need to know the lay of the local
and a friend of mine who just went down

177
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,320
to haiti

178
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,149
on to do a project there that was
supposed to be disturbing One Laptop Per

179
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:40,210
Child laptops

180
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,860
never got off the ground because in
Haiti graft corruption are rife

181
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,060
am the one that tops are the XO's are in
a container someplace

182
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,730
and on will not be getting like it out
there until something gets brought

183
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,860
so you know its it it takes a knowledge
of

184
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,660
the fact that these things will happen
on the ground and somebody who's able to

185
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,770
sort of works for those things to
actually get people to where they need

186
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,970
to be

187
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,529
I'm sorta further going on from there

188
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:07,630
Nazi I am

189
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:10,930
and talks a little bit about sugar and

190
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,920
the focus you know this this this debate
about should

191
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,729
well PCs run sugar or should they run
Windows

192
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,720
on the night as I wouldn't want to just
see the running Windows but I don't see

193
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,640
I think he says

194
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,910
don't you know exclude the possibility
but just focusing energy on sugar is

195
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,910
that liberal enough for a

196
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,760
cleaner energy if we will focus on on
Laptop Per Child

197
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,270
and actually getting you know morning
out there or is learning

198
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,199
what we should do and then is the
software is having open source software

199
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,710
I'm a call or is it a means to an end

200
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,500
I and I believe the side came down on
was on

201
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,890
if it takes running Windows takes be
able to run Windows I know some

202
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,860
countries that have been offered deals
from a much tougher child have said

203
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:59,000
on your offering a software that's not
used by industry so how's this useful to

204
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,100
our children

205
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,620
I you know if if they're going to say
that is really useful sale or snarky

206
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,700
laptops & you know and not go out there
so

207
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,170
I'm these are basically the issues i
think is going to talk about 10 minutes

208
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,040
we're going to the stuff

209
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,010
I would say myself which is hopefully

210
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,819
a little bit more even and a little bit
funnier

211
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:26,279
so

212
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,290
so the last time I spoke at Hope II
talks about

213
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,890
actually entry this I explain why is
that educators have recognized that

214
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:34,959
hackers are cracks

215
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,520
in their critique schooling I actually
drew on Steven Levy the keynote speaker

216
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,560
from tomorrow's

217
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,860
look at hers for this and soul
reiterated fewest points here

218
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,680
factual findings from research on
education and cognition

219
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,209
so here's the first one I mistrust
authority and promote centralization

220
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,180
lectures and teachers center
construction on tend not to stick

221
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,750
it was people are actively engaged in
their learning I'm studying education

222
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,670
basically found that on its better you
only unless their hands on

223
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,349
things on stick as well it's harder for
them to remember always yield hands-on

224
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,920
care /div similarly when learning
happens in context we are actually

225
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,810
working on a real-world projects

226
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:14,120
you tend to remember things better
package should be judged by their

227
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,320
hacking

228
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,980
standardized tests really kinda makes
for poor quality long-term morning tends

229
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,000
to be rather fragile

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,029
I you wherever the short term and you
forget it news cram for XO

231
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,240
on you know actually being able to have
hands-on skills is sorta more per minute

232
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,839
warning

233
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,190
and hackers and to explain the details
programmable systems

234
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,190
I cocking researchers found that
generating hypotheses keeps your brain

235
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,770
limber

236
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,149
and develops expertise a professional
sort

237
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,149
so this is a a good critique from clev
I'm

238
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,860
but how do we use these points to change
education and some sort of real way

239
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,670
this is why I went back to school a
certain spending a lot of time thinking

240
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,350
about it

241
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,420
and let's explore the possibilities this
is the diamond age by Neal Stephenson

242
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,950
how many people for this book

243
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,230
I'm so glad to see that I've I found
that a lot of the time

244
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,470
a you bring this book up it becomes a
real touchstone because

245
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,149
a basically the book describes the
creation

246
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,510
love %uh and the deployment of an AI
driven nanotech infuse book

247
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:16,959
I which is called the only zilstra prime
and is capable of leading a child

248
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,630
through a complete education what's
better this is not an education with

249
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:23,080
preset lesson plans and standardized
tests

250
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,399
the learning process is guided by the
child's own curiosity and the book

251
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,800
adapts to

252
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,149
what is teaching to answer the child's
questions about everything

253
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:34,320
from the alphabets to programming

254
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,029
to martial arts to outdoor survival

255
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,279
and so on its it's kind of like the XO

256
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,350
popped up on extra AI

257
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,310
and at the same time %uh the primer is a
to love mass education

258
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,300
it's like public school system or like
Sesame Street steve is a story

259
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,890
follows number of girls as the young
girls ladies illustrated primer teaches

260
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,290
them

261
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:01,360
Stevenson gives us a lot of room to
imagine a primer it really gets exciting

262
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,450
it feels like a combination I love Lego
Mindstorms and stork

263
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,730
and Wikipedia and the electric company
and the enterprise is on board computer

264
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:14,610
hacking Linux kernel all wrapped up any
creams fairytales touring show

265
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,589
so basically two primers fabulous it has
all the benefits of the technology

266
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:21,709
and technology can give education with
non the drawbacks

267
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,080
if Reimer we all wanna make the primer
how hard we have to go

268
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,390
let me take you through a tour of the
back end of the educational media system

269
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,459
what we ostensibly need to hack

270
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:37,490
in order to build the primer last year I
was hired to develop

271
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,630
a computer systems curriculum for high
schoolers

272
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,630
I was really excited about the job at
first because the network of schools is

273
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,630
being written for

274
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,570
actually didn't rich kids to get
hands-on learn through real-world

275
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,860
projects

276
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,769
the only problem was it was being run by
cue minor key music

277
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:58,660
dot dot Da a textbook company

278
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,500
working on textbooks can be positively
kafkaesque

279
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,120
if you've read surely you're joking
mister fineman a

280
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,420
which I hope everybody has 5 physicist
richard fineman

281
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,760
I who is also a great lock picker as it
turns out

282
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,800
she was also once caught called on to
review text books

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,970
his fellow reviewers were given a plank
book says the publisher hadn't finished

284
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,130
yes and on the basis of these blank
pages his fellow reviewers gave the book

285
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:32,390
a good grade and the title was set to be
distributed to schools

286
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,470
I should have been warned in my own
curriculum when Michael writers I were

287
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,769
asked to develop a lesson plan entitled
software piracy

288
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,709
as an exercise we were given a suggested
list of questions which included

289
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:50,709
what should I do if I think I have
received a legal software

290
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,740
whatever four main types of legal
software there's only four of them

291
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,589
four main types can guess what they are
cast are and how do they differ

292
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:04,120
and then how to software piracy affect
our nation's economy

293
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,950
and our future job opportunities

294
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:11,019
also it might have been a hit when the
outline showed a preventing security

295
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,700
problems lesson with a subheading

296
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,000
using what Windows accounts

297
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,820
the task I was given was a stack of
tasks finance the nationwide program I

298
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,100
was writing for was supposed to prepare
to Spanish high schoolers

299
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,589
for the kinda abstract learning that
have to do in college however the course

300
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,440
I was developing was supposed to get
kids

301
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,260
a posture a fight which is basically a
technical certification

302
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,490
not a plus certificates pose Lee
requires 500 hours of hands-on work with

303
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,610
computers

304
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,649
so I started reading a crucial a market
for building machines from scratch in

305
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:43,720
fucking around with prejudice

306
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,610
but then the editor start to ask
questions with teachers have

307
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,839
administrative access to their machines

308
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,389
probably not with schools be willing to
spare machines for kids open

309
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:56,180
up guessing no with teachers even be
comfortable opening up

310
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,560
case for ya not likely so they told me
to take out the hands on stuff

311
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,800
which if you recall the school's mission
actually called for

312
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:10,800
to focus on making kids right and read
about computers

313
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:14,089
so frankly I was part of the problem
they hired me knowing that I haven't

314
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:14,549
done

315
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:17,668
a little bit of Java coding but don't
actually have much expertise

316
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,209
under the hood of a computer when I
asked to get paid for doing research to

317
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:22,630
further my knowledge they said

318
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,730
you're not being paid to learn just
write the curriculum

319
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,440
so when the fire will finally hired
somebody to review my content I was

320
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,179
really thrilled because I was worried
I'd write something wrong in thousands

321
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:34,880
of kids would end up electrocuted

322
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,929
I also thought this guy was an old hand
his computer systems a structured

323
00:17:37,929 --> 00:17:41,169
Community College he'll be able to give
me tips on teaching and engaging way to

324
00:17:41,169 --> 00:17:43,049
students were kind about it

325
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,320
so I wrote to and I said he came I Can
Has lesson plans

326
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,570
and he set me back the following I now
mind you these are his side's the only

327
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,700
thing I've altered as the backgrounds
kinda came up

328
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,400
and I have changed in any way

329
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,430
can't do this what is the one here's a
typical computer system

that the mouse is a very complicated

device

333
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,460
and it has a scroll wheel and the left

335
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,690

be described in three works

instructional materials were

339
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,920
step-by-step

340
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,980
and unless I forget to mention I

341
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,690
there was one lesson that was going to
be Mac and Linux and the rest of the

342
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,180
curriculum was supposed to be

343
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:47,090
in Windows the process have individually
picking up and moving thousands of files

344
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,090
on our desk is a slow process

345
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:54,129
obviously this is an important piece of
knowledge that kids need to memorize

346
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,860
right

347
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,810
no further explanation was given to me
about this one I can only hope that when

348
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,750
he used the slide to actually explain
what the hell was going on

349
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,550
and yes it headlines were all in all
caps storage devices

350
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,590
yes they are

351
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,699
and my personal favorite can you to

352
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,870
if can you name it let's try security

server space invader sewing machine on I
think it might be a speak n spell in a

356
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:39,110
microwave and then there's something
telephonic down to bottom

357
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:42,200
but they're not going to tell the kids
that's what it is or so

358
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,480
they didn't hire me to be an expert on
computer systems who did they hire the

359
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,929
guy who was supposed to be my oversight
rarely questioned

360
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:52,500
anything I wrote it was the blind
leading the blind and frankly we needed

361
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,429
you guys there

362
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:58,799
but I into grad school I thought we
needed was the primer

363
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,889
better technology than we have now but
let's read the primer

364
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,830
a little bit more closely stevensons
book mainly follows three girls

365
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,840
now Elizabeth and Fianna no spoilers but
knows the one who ends up making the

366
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,520
most of what she learns from the primer

367
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,070
and limit when we look at why it comes
down to a human factor

368
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:19,230
a single devoted teacher Meranda

369
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,169
or in this case the on-board computer
UVC USS Enterprise middle parent

370
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:28,360
is behind the scenes working with now
through the book what we really need

371
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,190
and this is what I 16 saying and Isaac
sorry what ivins been saying about all

372
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,000
PC

373
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,970
we really need is better people to wheel
and other social institutions

374
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:41,250
another point of Steven Levy said I'd
like to return to is the sharing part of

375
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,080
the hacker ethic

376
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,780
it's obviously behind the open source
software thick but unfortunately

377
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,200
simply promoting open source software
will not change how people

378
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,450
use technology as I miss be explained in
detail

379
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,020
Norris sharing information enough
research shows us that technology

380
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,500
usually does not solve social problems
without

381
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:03,860
social help people take old habits and
apply them to new situations and

382
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,710
technologies

383
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,390
we see is around the internet all-time
let me introduce you to my dissertation

384
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,190
this is not my dissertation is one web
sites and looking at I like to describe

385
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,030
my dissertation

386
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,280
as either scraping the bottom the
internets we're discovering the source

387
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,340
eternal September for those of you who
remember eternal September this kinda

388
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,030
blog says

389
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,340
thread is basically what I'm looking at
some hapless blogger post about

390
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,840
something random from their own life

391
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,559
and suddenly Connor show up asking for
help with something usually contacting a

392
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,309
celebrity

393
00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,370
canceling a technical service or finding
arcane information like

394
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,510
what kind of spider just that my brother
and his poisonous

395
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:43,350
the blogger can help them in the
blogger's friends spend an increasingly

396
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,440
long thread for love

397
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,960
the club love basically mocking lol
users as clueless

398
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,419
I'm so what you see here is a a post
from a block all communications

399
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:54,950
elsewhere where guys Tony nice little
anecdote about

400
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:58,149
on how he cancels the fax service to her
critically freaking hard it was

401
00:21:58,149 --> 00:22:02,520
%uh and you go a little ways down the
comments and you get people starting to

402
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,908
say I cannot meet you fax please cancel
and let me know if I cancel

403
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,480
and I don't believe she left an email
address so I'm not sure how she supposed

404
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,830
to be

405
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,418
allowed to know she cancelled the water
comes back and says model

406
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,860
what the hell is wrong with these people
and then somebody else says I did not

407
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,899
order effects service my youngest
daughter did this she does not live here

408
00:22:19,899 --> 00:22:23,630
I do not want or need the service I'm
having a problem is paying my bills now

409
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:26,750
on SSI please contact me at my email
address and your

410
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:30,169
is a along with her name in all caps so

411
00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,260
on we see this over and over and it is
the point where there's actually

412
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,570
consistent linguistic

413
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,770
um way of posting up a comment like this
in a consistent set of things that

414
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,270
bloggers are saying to them and the
funny thing is you end up seeing enough

415
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:42,830
of these

416
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,710
and you side with the cause connors
because the blogger's almost always

417
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,419
give their post a title which is really
misleading canceling a fax service

418
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:53,450
is this the page for canceling a fax I
don't know maybe it is

419
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,289
I mean good title heading there is just
about as big as communications from

420
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,210
elsewhere what is a communication from
elsewhere what else were we talking

421
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:00,530
about

422
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,970
whose blog is this i mean maybe you know
how to read the URL below

423
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,289
girls are long complicated things um

424
00:23:07,289 --> 00:23:11,169
was a was a for that matter what the
fuck is a block so you know

425
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:16,049
um and in this case the guy says my name
is Josh but which Josh I know later josh

426
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:19,610
is one in Josh's I know is like a josh
is famous or something like that I have

427
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:20,679
no idea who this guy is

428
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,429
I am you know and in

429
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,350
this case %uh he is put anatole bar
there was people showed up

430
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,740
says to learn how to cancel your effect
service click here very nice and very

431
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,980
friendly contrast very nicely with his
very beige website

432
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:39,610
but if you want to the evil interfaces
on talk earlier today which was fabulous

433
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:43,919
%uh the speaker there basically said
yeah it looks like an ad people are

434
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,210
gonna start start with darts banner
blindness basically people can see this

435
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,940
so if they if they see a thing it looks
like maybe it's a

436
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,710
a deceptive ads saying this is where you
can sleep fax service who knows if we

437
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,309
should believe it

438
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:57,010
I just don't know I'm how are we
supposed to read this

439
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,129
remember until 2000 there wasn't even a
convention for building blocks

440
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,950
so the running conventions for how to
read blocks either

441
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,820
our understanding a blogs is very new
it's even newer for the long tail

442
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,840
readers than is for early adopter
writers you can just blame this on the

443
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,178
stupid people out there because it's not
just a lil

444
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,669
users who are responsible for the
phenomenon here Josh the blogger

445
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,799
obscures who he is with the help of the
blogging software which puts its about

446
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:24,450
link somewhere over on the right hand
side which once again it's not where

447
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,040
people's eyes track when looking at this
page

448
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,250
a and then a lil Scrappy a search
algorithm good looks

449
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:34,130
at the site ranks highly cuz i gol
canceling a fax is unlike age 6 or

450
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:35,559
something like that so

451
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:40,230
ago %uh Google was they're slightly less
crappy algorithm ranks this page number

452
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,230
tool for canceling a fax

453
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:46,330
because book Google is basically a
popularity contest and a number smartass

454
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,570
bloggers

455
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,879
indicated this is a good site to go for
for her like about this phone is sad

456
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,750
about Kashmir

457
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,179
fax so great job guys you know you just
made the internet stupider

458
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,830
waco I'm

459
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,370
right and frankly they don't teach you
how to read website and school

460
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:08,309
it's not the same as reading a textbook
it's not the same as reading a newspaper

461
00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:11,570
so anyway while Stephen levi's
distillation up the hacker ethic a

462
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,980
really smart ideals

463
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,770
wish I'd like to see more people conform
to they're not the only axioms we need

464
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,570
if you want to enlighten people and
build primer

465
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,939
Packers need to be smarter social
engineers and I want to suggest

466
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,289
corollaries the hacker ethic

467
00:25:27,289 --> 00:25:30,408
conversations begin sends an ACK not Sen

468
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:36,120
fuck you act

469
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,520
few I'm you want to be like this guy
decides as I've been trolling around

470
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,270
looking for

471
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,850
examples a misunderstanding at the
internet this came to this came up on

472
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,960
you've got a city council person from
tuttle oklahoma saying who gave you

473
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,710
permission to enter invade my website
and block me and everyone else from

474
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,850
accessing it question mark times three

475
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,630
please remove your software immediately
before I reported to government

476
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,669
officials exclamation point times to

477
00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:00,870
I am the city manager of total a coma
%uh

478
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,620
and he sent this to the company sent aus
whose a I guess was a man pager

479
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,039
something was showing up in place for
their actual website

480
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,450
Anders want to get a sense of is begins
I feel sorry for your city

481
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,720
don't begin a conversation with an
insult even if the other people person

482
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,980
insults you first it's just not a good
way to

483
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,470
manage your tech support frankly I'm
clearly know same here

484
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,539
either when it came to that job the
textile company I eventually quit and

485
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:27,600
said to my boss

486
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,080
you're feeding children crap in lies and
I'm not to participate in this anymore

487
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:34,320
I think socialist niceties are retarded
I know love you think social niceties

488
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,710
are retarded but unfortunately they are
the way

489
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,270
to finesse social hack and Britt for
solutions don't work

490
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:45,408
self um

491
00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:50,110
im the next carly Rae like to offer is
when your code expects binary input you

492
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,600
don't call it irrational when you feed
hex

493
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,820
and it crashes people reason using the
tools they have at hand

494
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,149
they act according to rules they've
developed with people around them

495
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:04,539
consider the hole in the wall project in
India which found street children using

496
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,080
a public Windows machine called the
r-class cursor

497
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,168
a drum and the pointer and middle didn't
know about our classes and they had no

498
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:12,409
context for a cursor

499
00:27:12,409 --> 00:27:15,770
so they made sense to them using things
in the community and calling a cursor

500
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:18,750
and he'll probably help them understand
what was going on the computer but held

501
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:21,530
up the trunk

502
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:25,399
the action too many new tech users may
look a logical to us for example

503
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:29,200
using a computer in the rain with only
some saran wrap to help you

504
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,780
or using a CD as a venir y you comb your
hair or the classic

505
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:36,389
using your CD Drive as a cup holder and
breaking your machine that way

506
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:39,799
atop this is actually not necessarily
about his interesting you so for the

507
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,379
laptop for child is going on I think

508
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,530
Thailand on where the kids were doing a

509
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,950
biodiversity project by documenting
local plants using the camera and

510
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,879
computer so on

511
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:51,919
on this is awesome things are happening
with LTC I'm so people reason using the

512
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,010
tools they have at hand

513
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,480
and I said that already the action too
many new tech users may look a logical

514
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,369
to us but they often simply expect

515
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:03,470
other input computer sciences particular
flavor of Western logic

516
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:07,440
is not cultural universal it's built on
our metaphors and language

517
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,010
another extra abstractions and you can
call me a relative a sippy if you have

518
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,500
to

519
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,750
but even some people from our own home
own hometowns

520
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,200
grew up in other historical material
circumstances which makes the ways

521
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,679
we use technology look baffling and
counter-intuitive where the major things

522
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,720
I see is I'm going on the internet
looking for examples of misunderstanding

523
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,750
in this happen on my own blog

524
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:29,760
is people showing up and mistaking a
blogger for celebrity

525
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,740
the classic example showed up on
Metafilter a while back where I am

526
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,800
somebody

527
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,540
wrote a post saying I want to see more
republicans talk show and more I said is

528
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,760
really stupid thing I had a great time
the end and people showed up saying dear

529
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,059
Mario need you find my baby daddy and
needed to give me a makeover I needed to

530
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,408
change my life

531
00:28:44,409 --> 00:28:48,300
a and that happens a lot but the
interesting thing is if you go back in

532
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,100
time

533
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,490
there is really a a really incredible
longstanding precedent

534
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:56,889
%uh writing letters to people I to you
don't know it all about things that are

535
00:28:56,889 --> 00:28:59,210
kinda crazy like in the nineteen fifties

536
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,740
Wilkie Collins was a a romantic writer
at the time wrote first

537
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,460
guess thriller novels and he got letters
from people saying

538
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,379
I I know your hairline isn't real but
she's really awesome and I wanna find a

539
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:14,000
woman she's based on can you tell her I
wanna marry her you know so marriage

540
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,530
proposal coming out this

541
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,070
on the town of Verona Italy for a long
time has I

542
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:22,100
received letters for Juliet as an Romeo
and Juliet

543
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,230
I and that sorta funny considering if
you read the play you know that even if

544
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,230
she doesn't exist she sort of not a
condition to be answering any

545
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,530
male you know so I'm the CNN Anderson

546
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:36,940
really great examples of people writing
on letters to slavery so newspapers for

547
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,350
years and years and some newspapers
basically held onto these letters

548
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,210
the fact is the internet just makes more
transparent it's not the people are

549
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:45,490
getting any stupider and it's not that
they're stupid they're just doing

550
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,010
something it makes sense to them and

551
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,559
my and my interest is more in finding
out quite make sense

552
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,299
a

553
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,309
so basically I treating

554
00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:00,408
their technology uses regiment a
rational or logical

555
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:03,250
doesn't help us build any better
technology and it doesn't help us spread

556
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,510
the message is would like to stress

557
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,799
sent

558
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,879
this is why would I vince says about the
laptop for Child project is particularly

559
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:11,970
troubling

560
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,889
deployment is the most important step
history suggests the social change

561
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:19,169
programs which don't research culture
other target country's diet tragic

562
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:20,220
wasteful deaths

563
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,929
which are sometimes darkly amusing but
tragic respond unless

564
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:27,159
if you to playing any technology you
need to get into the mindset and culture

565
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,669
the people who are supposed to use it

566
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:34,610
and then you need to get the technology
into shape to fit that culture

567
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,980
finally my last candidate for additions
to the hacker ethic is that

568
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,840
vulnerability

569
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,629
is opportunity on which i sort actually
kinda expected steven levy to say but he

570
00:30:42,629 --> 00:30:44,080
never really did

571
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,399
this goes not just for security goes for
social systems as well

572
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,129
changing the way people use technology
is a matter of finding the right

573
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:51,570
vulnerabilities and network

574
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,960
laws funding media and other social
institutions including education system

575
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,399
I've been thinking about these
vulnerabilities a lot currently the No

576
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,889
Child Left Behind Act makes it hard to
talk about what

577
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,429
teaching anything else the school's
standardized tests technology is

578
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:07,379
basically completely out the window

579
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:11,000
I with the election coming up this might
change the department had changed our

580
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,409
school

581
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:15,510
guard completely and Bush took office I
and it could happen again

582
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,700
and speaking at the Changing the Guard I
just use a couple things about what's

583
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,540
going down the department

584
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:22,559
education first of all this is the
building department education is how it

585
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,510
looks right now

586
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,690
I did not photoshopped shop this
unfortunately what they did

587
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,899
is they took this idiot hideous concrete
block soviet-style building

588
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,600
and i close personal tech you read
facades on the front that the No Child

589
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,869
Left Behind like an old schoolhouse

590
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:39,649
I'm it basically is it's like what we do
to schools it's a band-aid on

591
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:43,580
a larger problem as far as I can tell
the other scary thing about third-party

592
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,059
education is on

593
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,580
go around to see and talk to people who
have been in

594
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:52,080
educational change work and just
educational policy work for a long time

595
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,990
there's so many years old they're
battle-scarred they know

596
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,340
you know what's trend was a fat and
what's not I'm

597
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,090
none of them were working for the
department education right now we spend

598
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,100
a day and Mike

599
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,960
policy class going on talking with the
septuagenarian so we want to hear

600
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,260
and everybody inside that building is
younger than me I'm 31

601
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,730
and their main claim to fame is that
they work for congressman so-and-so up

602
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,290
in the hills a page

603
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,790
I'm so that's what the wheel right now
we've with our hope that things can I

604
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,049
change I would really like to see
somebody who actually

605
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:24,490
gives the first flying care about on

606
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,020
educational technology in there because
it is not I don't even mention

607
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,580
in any other policy briefs right now are
neither policy recommendations

608
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,490
it was mentioned in the clinton
administration wants bush came in

609
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,100
nothing

610
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,419
thing and documentation speak of a so it
could happen again in things could

611
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,159
change for the next election things
could not change we really have to see

612
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,340
how that goes

613
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,419
on even if things do change maybe people
are still scared by the economy right

614
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:49,399
now to think about being anything less
than rigorous in the classroom and rigor

615
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,629
to people mean standardized tests a lot
of time

616
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:55,869
so I'm thinking about your options what
about after school programs

617
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:00,070
as places to teach technology what about
the superhero store in Brooklyn a pirate

618
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:03,080
store in San Francisco e26 really good
places

619
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,850
lots of ways to connect with kids
without the final structure schools

620
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,299
mass media art mass anymore so getting
educational media is broader

621
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:12,320
distribution a Sesame Street is

622
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,500
less likely how do we ensure that we
reach

623
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,149
that many kids and how we mobilize
million so far and urs

624
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:23,109
teachers to teach three primers what
about Google's 20 percent program I've

625
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:23,980
been thinking

626
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,440
where employees are in theory at least
encouraged to spend the equivalent of

627
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,320
one day a week doing work social
benefits I hear it doesn't usually work

628
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,750
out that way but

629
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,790
it's on the books a Google Google if
you're not gonna be evil a we could work

630
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,530
something out

631
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,629
so we have to basically find the places
which will actually give a little

632
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:45,090
push aside from the nanotech we more or
less have the technology we need to make

633
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,109
the primer

634
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:50,260
we've got the Internet we've got
Wikipedia we've got all PCs

635
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,280
we can keep perfecting educational
technologies in till we're blue in the

636
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,950
face

637
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,309
and we can make new an even better ones
this is just not

638
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:01,168
the problem anymore we really want to
change technology in education

639
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:08,168
we need more miranda's to help deliver
thats all I have to say

640
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,750
and we have plenty of time left

641
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:18,040
and I know I've got some colleagues from
my department the audience's other folks

642
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,639
when your interest in the subject so

643
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,150
let's start a discussion Mike sir
up-front be standing because the

644
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:28,430
they actually cash on cameras we get to
record the entire discussion so

645
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:32,179
its have how much for this do you think

646
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,399
is just a research question getting more
teachers in the classroom

647
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,139
and lowering the student-teacher ratio I
think

648
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,739
and I think florida student-teacher
ratios important although this some sort

649
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,700
of questions about

650
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,090
whether that is most important thing but

651
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,660
I think you're writing one of the things
that we know now the classrooms is there

652
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:52,159
really is nationwide

653
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,850
I'm like a five to one computer to kid
ratio notes right here at 125

654
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:58,930
one computer for every five kids in
school which is a pretty decent

655
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,819
ratio on most schools are pretty well
connected they still got a lot in that

656
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,300
name software that kinda sucks

657
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,380
but the real issue I'm that we found in
my advisers

658
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,070
a governess on is that people teach the
way that they were taught and

659
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,570
most the teachers were alive right now
were never taught using technology

660
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,030
I wasn't even me a lot of time
technology even in our generation has

661
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,340
been taught as an add-on

662
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,850
so you know I did look on basic
programming but it was applied to my

663
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,420
english classes and if it had been

664
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,430
I might have started programming earlier
because you know I was interested in in

665
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,399
his linguistic thing

666
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,830
so yeah I think really want the critical
things is gonna be teacher training and

667
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,160
I'm introducing more educators to
discussing

668
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,430
in the back has this microphone work

669
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,029
it's good and out when you said oil PC
is like a tool against the government

670
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,610
the internets

671
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,620
I don't think this is 07 I thought you
were saying we had to like Wikipedia

672
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:51,930
to like have counteract the government
right I

673
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,290
this payment that we are you know this
is we got tools to

674
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:58,210
to we I miss it's not clear if the
government the whole idea the primers

675
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,900
it's a tool to educate kids in with kids
wanna be educated

676
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,050
right now so are a dozen it seem weird
that we would export way people's

677
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,270
technology to Africa

678
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,550
not give them the infrastructure to
actually build those things yes

679
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,820
have yessir from these things that
they're not actually able to build

680
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,460
yes and also like kinda ruin the
environment in making his computers

681
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,940
yeah I just wanna make generations of
consumers those are other critics that

682
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,560
have been raised to cancel BC I know I
mean

683
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,130
particularly in African cultures
countries a lot of governments down

684
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:26,570
there

685
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:30,050
you know they have seen this these
policies are structural adjustment and

686
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:34,360
other things that have come down Africa
a and they sort of go this is another

687
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,140
set of technology which doesn't

688
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,460
take our local situation into account
why are you guys doing this can you give

689
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,480
us something that's useful

690
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,660
so love you know and prolly that's not

691
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:47,379
everywhere on what is something that's
useful sorry what is something that's

692
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:47,760
useful

693
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,870
I think dialogue I think dialogue
getting more people

694
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,650
talking I think talking is important I
think and and like I said I mean it like

695
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:57,710
all PC and the previous projects at
Nicholas neither party was on and many

696
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,470
many social change projects in general

697
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:02,750
don't necessarily they're not built on
good research on

698
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:06,980
how communities already do things on
where the really interesting examples if

699
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,190
you want to look into

700
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,940
good and bad examples of love how
cultural changes

701
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,170
is adapted on these two things if you
like the tipping point you should read

702
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:15,920
the book that was like

703
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,190
stolen from on which is diffusion of
innovations

704
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,570
by Evert Rogers which is a book this
thick on the best things we know about

705
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,390
social change

706
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:28,029
and more a less dry policy like booking
a more entertaining book is the spirit

707
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,300
catches you and you fall down which is a
great book about

708
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:34,300
on hell some policy is

709
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,440
and the monk community and I think Laos
and Cambodia

710
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,910
I did sort of look into how to people
start messages about health change

711
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:42,899
health technologies

712
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,990
I'm and it looked into ways they did
that so they help parades

713
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:49,230
no they didn't do like a radio broadcast
which is not maybe not necessarily what

714
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,390
people were into their they if they help
parades with

715
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,440
traditional storytelling characters they
said you know this is you know I

716
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,220
this is how you do this particular
health thing and then that works a

717
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:57,860
little better

718
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,920
as was suggested maybe radios more
important for developing

719
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,930
world yeah just because you can actually
build those things yeah radio is

720
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:09,120
certainly very useful I've seems the
projects their

721
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,950
so um question of fact well just two
quick comments

722
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:17,140
wonderful upon on Greece's issue with

723
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,310
lacks infrastructure we felt l16

724
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,120
started the Homebrew Computer Club kinda
started the whole personal computing

725
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,680
a revolution and United take credit away
from other people who can't read

726
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,879
that either but he makes exactly that
same complain as well

727
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,310
criticism I the and it's well worth
looking %uh police said I think about

728
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,060
while Casey specifically yes I merely

729
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,779
we had a lot of experience is the only
hero about him as well on if they had a

730
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,500
system

731
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,870
and in the Bay Area back today where
they just have a computer

732
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,330
on people gotten play in this week's
play it sorted with that one

733
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:52,680
your song and the second I guess it's a
plugger just have you

734
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,480
read this is a the model machine on it's
a coping the

735
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,790
the model machine on edge it ok edgy
topia a

736
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,180
specifically about the the academic
textbook industry and how it's processed

737
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,859
and marketed in

738
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:09,120
reduced down to pack

739
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:14,049
I it clearly illustrates the entire
process and political force hine

740
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:17,490
why text books are written the way and
that's i mean is this an interesting

741
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:18,550
stuff without like

742
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:23,650
a New York Inc Texas yeah I Florida and
California sort of have i mean when I

743
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,490
worked in text with

744
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,900
at mcgraw-hill across the street they're
basically like we do whatever they say

745
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,600
because they have the most kids are so
the biggest market and so what they say

746
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,240
goes

747
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,150
on give us the state title real clear
one more time the model machine

748
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:39,370
modern model and model like yeah
muddling through something mother arms

749
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:42,520
and it's on at utopia which i think is
EDU

750
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,830
topia dot word cool amicable turn it up

751
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,200
I'm sorry I don't remember then name of
course the stuff

752
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,600
the back arm I'm from Canada so the
education

753
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,759
issue is a little bit different here
were where

754
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,530
I'm from are we do have technology
programs but

755
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,950
I I like the whole thing with the young
ladies illustrated primer

756
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,950
and the technology programs I that

757
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,420
when when we have it technology program
it's basically

758
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,780
here's Word and Excel R-rated resume in
a personal letter

759
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,330
an

760
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:20,620
and learn how to add two cells yeah and
I feel like that's almost

761
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,980
more over hurdle to overcome because
it's not just

762
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,170
let's change a policy it it has to you
have to change the whole way everyone

763
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,370
thinks about it

764
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:33,810
like the computer program is nothing
like a castle touring from the

765
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,240
the primer I love where instead of

766
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,360
learning to sit down at a computer she
was given chains

767
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,750
and you could flip bets on the chains
like it's like this is a story that has

768
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,850
told the primers that the hero in now

769
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:48,970
goes into this world and I'm ends up in
a castle where she solving this puzzle

770
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,990
using chains and

771
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,590
basically just demonstrates you know how
a bit works on through through playing

772
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:54,480
with changes

773
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,740
lovely its it's like an adult quote um

774
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,280
computer science is to computers as
astronomy is two telescopes

775
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:05,440
and I'm just kinda curious as to

776
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,000
what you think is that trick to overcome
the feel that

777
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,810
technology courses should be about
making good little office workers in Sec

778
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:14,980
go teach

779
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,410
you go teach all you go teach at least
for a little while you burn out really

780
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:20,779
quickly go teach school work and after
school program

781
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,110
I'm serious find some hacker space is
your hackerspace you should get high

782
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:26,370
school kids in there that you get your
high school kids

783
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:28,900
elementary school kids their parents are
freaking out there like oh my god

784
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,240
they're gonna bust my children because
that's what the media is telling them to

785
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,060
get as many children as you can in their

786
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,540
in these little space is because I mean
if we don't have teachers if the

787
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,840
teachers we have only know how to use
word on

788
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:44,280
and I've really been sorted
unfortunately exposed a

789
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,150
lately to I did digital divide

790
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:52,640
in gender I did some studies on high
school girls and technology and it was

791
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,060
just

792
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,509
alarming how the girls would try to hide
from me that they're playing video games

793
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,960
at all

794
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:00,810
like they just did not want think
themselves as gamers like they didn't do

795
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,450
anything

796
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,140
you know they they they be like a half a
text box and PlayStation Obama but I

797
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,839
never play at home I never play with my
friends like where you playing

798
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,930
you're lying to me in some way they did
conflict themselves so

799
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,149
I mean and most the teaching force is
female and it's just

800
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,020
you we're gonna keep perpetuating this
is is this is just how it's gonna be it

801
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,070
is going to be his gender divide

802
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,110
unless we start breaking up the usual
whole to food as one so

803
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,120
in this conference between someone
actually get some time okay first I

804
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,150
wanna plug my

805
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,170
to plug my hackerspace I am we have

806
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,350
up apartheid DC and we're actually you
can looking out

807
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,630
a doing an after school program so

808
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,160
wherever William aback at the mike just
come to see me

809
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,509
my name's Tino um I wanna know how's
your research

810
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,070
done anything about how to how to

811
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,180
get kids to plug in i mean you know this

812
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,250
this whole conference should be

813
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,180
like 10 times is huge cuz it's like

814
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,450
interesting stuff that we're doing you
know but

815
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:04,550
at a very early age we just to now

816
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,870
year you know its its I think that's
something we need to think about because

817
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,609
obviously the people in this room

818
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:13,260
the stuff we do usually fastening like
it's really interesting stuff why is it

819
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,100
not passing the other kids and I don't
know

820
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:18,620
I mean I am I'm not doing it part of it
is probably the gender stuff you know

821
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:21,069
where we're girls are just like the
computer is not for me but

822
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,630
it is thank you um when you are

823
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,080
I mean if you're going to want to a
program like this listen to the kids

824
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,259
let the kids tell let them tell you what
they want to do and what they want to

825
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,250
use computers for

826
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,030
on I don't know if there's some way to
get people

827
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,830
more into the getting their hands messy
with the the guts machine

828
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,779
if we can find that we should do that we
gotta be with working on that because

829
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,690
all he's not doing and I think it's just
gonna happens like you give people to

830
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:47,440
cut machine a little crazy but

831
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,460
it doesn't always happen so okay

832
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,260
no cuz I was just I was just gonna say
that most people that I see nowadays

833
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,300
are it education is a means to an end

834
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,000
to get a great job so they can waive fee
leave the

835
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,110
the a the bling bling lifestyle

836
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,920
and you know go out and drink you know
kristall at night and stuff like that

837
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,630
and you know

838
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:15,100
I mean you know and that's not that's
not I mean that last one ask them why

839
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,820
they want that I mean think about I
think a lot of times that comes from

840
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,390
feelings of current and security it's
like I am

841
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,870
in a place where I you know my moms on
section 8 our house just burn down and

842
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,339
talk about a particular student I've
been working with since she was 12 she

843
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,210
is now in college

844
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,860
you know and she very much a first was
just like I need to be able to climb up

845
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,060
by my mama house

846
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,130
am so you know there are very specific
financial goals that they get there if

847
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,030
you get them into that

848
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:40,400
if you get them into if you help them
get to a place of safety I

849
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,000
I feel like there are ways to sort of go
let's rethink why that's your goal

850
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,380
you know but you gotta talk about the
things you can just assume that they

851
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,340
have those goals

852
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:51,340
and that's not going to change that you
have to open a dialogue and it has to be

853
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,000
long-term it just has to go on as we
face to face

854
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,290
you know you can always get people on
IRC you know it's just

855
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:01,300
it now yeah yeah saw okay a bit X

856
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,270
guide you actually exercised hold on so
okay up

857
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,620
and we have five minutes left I think
this I would like to mention that

858
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,930
I I do teach computer science at a
college-level

859
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,520
and I was teaching last year in a
liberal arts school

860
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,910
potsdam collagen upstate New York in
most the kids there were actually

861
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,180
interested in building a better world
not just getting a better job

862
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:26,770
it was I was very encouraging I

863
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:31,960
but my question is actually you mention
that we have to adapt our technology to

864
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,860
the culture wherever trying to to
deliver this technology

865
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,750
but when we're talking about educating
Americans use

866
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,760
nowadays more and more technology is
their culture

867
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,650
I think your I'm for my away rural town

868
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,350
I came here in this place I love this
place I went on to the Apple store at

869
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:53,950
about ten or eleven o'clock last night

870
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:57,340
in at least half the people are kids in
there just

871
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:01,810
they're just into it and the doctor
could standing around going

872
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,180
you know a does this plea so it's it's
it's its

873
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,149
you're saying is their culture basically
Russell technology is more and more

874
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,790
their culture so

875
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:13,330
it so versus like we trying to be the
teachers

876
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:16,740
are the ones that are behind and we're
were really

877
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,260
being prideful the king absolutely we
can teach them about the technology

878
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:25,560
sure it never does this one of the ideas
behind this sort of constructivist

879
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,860
education the idea is that you helped
you

880
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,620
you're a guide on the side you're not a
sage on the stage like i'm for signing

881
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,279
right now

882
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,860
your guide on the side of a kid on
helping them build their own homes farms

883
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,880
knowledge want a better studies that I
found on that

884
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,200
are wonderful professor Allan Mayer gave
us

885
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,780
she's to happen kit computers back in
the day she friggin awesome on

886
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:48,480
she has a lot to work on technology is
cool change the study she gave us was

887
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,480
the econ study Apple classrooms of
tomorrow

888
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,330
%uh the book is teaching with technology
on the project went on in 1984 and one

889
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,920
of the things they found was that there
were the

890
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,790
questions was more successful or the
ones where the teachers were OK with

891
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,640
noise

892
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,080
they're OK with not kid sitting at desks
and Rose having order we're there okay

893
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,900
with letting

894
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,960
particular kids take a leadership role
and maybe even kids resort marginalized

895
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,750
like the geeks got to leave the class a
little on that police were change the

896
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,150
dynamics in the classroom

897
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:17,150
so yeah I mean we have to change ID
about teaching

898
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:21,130
in order to teach with technology better
on yet they have their ways of using

899
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:21,780
technology

900
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,950
I already I mean what are the other
things or finding on

901
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,320
in the new literacy studies just sort of
my official field on

902
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,680
is thats you bring kids who already have
knowledge technology in a classroom

903
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,060
where teachers are like yes you're gonna
do microsoft excel work spreadsheet and

904
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,490
blah blah blah blah blah

905
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:41,100
and the kids are like oh my god I cannot
go to school anymore this does not

906
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:43,880
jive with what I know about technology
also yeah I'm there is a tremendous

907
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,030
problem

908
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:49,010
so I mean yeah this is what a big issue
love teacher training to a great extent

909
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:52,390
its its training in you know one
principle I know used to be my 9th grade

910
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:53,240
English teacher

911
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,270
I he just started up you start up a new
high school and

912
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,640
he's like I'm really trying to change
the faculty and how they think and I

913
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,540
like how you doing that he's like by
hiring and firing

914
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,990
because honestly yes it's really hard to
change how teachers think you can send

915
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:07,360
the all the professional development you
want to

916
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,090
they know how they were taught they know
that %uh you know people on policy even

917
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,950
telling them for years do this do that
it's like a Christmas tree model where

918
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:14,970
you're hanging

919
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:17,790
more little ornaments on your
educational program and it doesn't lead

920
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,840
to an overall vision

921
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,050
what should be happening or a net change
I'm so principal should have a vision

922
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,190
for these things

923
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,610
on and and we need to know that like its
it's very hard to an exchange

924
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,620
teachers I'm in a different place to
start we think the Teachers College is

925
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,029
on

926
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,440
in teacher training want the time that's
why I guess

927
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,560
many more questions look at you
afterwards so called thanks I think we

928
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:36,900
have

929
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,740
1 minute left so so

930
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,210
the cold front because just how many
women we had talked to go for a

931
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:48,590
you're really awesome shirts on my year
my name's Liam involved with

932
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:52,390
high club .to and I wanted to ask you
coming from a hackerspace do you have

933
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:56,270
any advice for people who run hackers
basics and others couple us in this room

934
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:01,070
um on approaching local high schools and
middle schools and saying hey we have

935
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:04,280
this we want to do something after
school program

936
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,470
it's a big scary like oh my god you're
talking to kids

937
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,420
yet how do you do mom hi gonna be really
hard with the name hacker in your title

938
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,470
for starters to people and they have the
whole black and white LED

939
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,900
um should get registers an NGO I think
that probably begin on the cut take to

940
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,570
be a non-profit be regular

941
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:25,130
on be ready for permission slips I you
know I'm trying to think of other things

942
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:29,160
%uh Donna the horse into how do how do
you sell it to a teacher

943
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,390
how do you sell it to a teacher um you
don't have to teach technology anymore

944
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:36,580
gonna do it for you

945
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:38,850
I think that works pretty darn well
because they know they're supposed to be

946
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,170
doing and they're like oh yeah I
understand this the kids these days so

947
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:44,620
you know present yourself as the kids
these days and I think that'll probably

948
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:45,290
work okay

949
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,940
site good luck and actually the the one
other little comment about Lake

950
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,520
kids these days and how they learn
technology and stuff um one of the best

951
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,830
ways to get kids into programming is say

952
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:59,140
you can make new myspace codes you can
make the ladies lose their shit you can

953
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,500
tell you know people don't don't don't
don't you go

954
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:04,120
don't you cry because if that's what
they want you fucking give it to them

955
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:04,700
okay

956
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,240
you give it up if her sparkly shiny

957
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,820
you most likely Chinese on their myspace

958
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:15,160
Scilly aesthetic that has nothing to do
with the code

959
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,450
that is a static FL get him interest in
the code is Riga

960
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:25,450
tonight

961
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:36,609
