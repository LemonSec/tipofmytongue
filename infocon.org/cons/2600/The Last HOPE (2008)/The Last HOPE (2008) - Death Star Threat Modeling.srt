1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,010
sign up for the fourth track in Zeus

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:07,210
DVD sales all talks in vendor area on
the eighteenth floor

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,200
and there is lots to see and do in the
pavilion

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,400
and then I think the the egg races in a
sec

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,830
nothing is later says hi I'm Kevin
Williams and again I'm here talking

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,260
about

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,390
information security and I Star Wars and
when I called the star threat modeling

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,160
the objectives here's one talk about the
basics what threat modeling is

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,450
identify threats responsibilities I have
a SME integrated into a suffered on life

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,030
cycle

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,250
and then basically we're going to Star
Wars 2 kinda is I

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,640
incomprehensible this a little
disclaimer

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,210
course no way I endorse a look as filmer
Lucas rain at John Cena

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,920
this will hardly be the worst case a
copyright infringement you'll see here

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,510
this weekend

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,750
a little background this is the
basically the

17
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,149
I'm not singer across the street i I
know what I'm talking about I

18
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,960
you know he to me that I was a fed prior
to this I I was in the Air Force ten

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,570
years

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,209
threes that information warfare
currently a mod

21
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,490
consultants getting paid for being a
know it all a background in software

22
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,220
engineering

23
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,720
and currently I'm a grad student
information security at Our Lady Lake

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:14,510
University

25
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,560
plug for them they're one of the eighty
and is a certified centers have academic

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,290
excellence in Information Assurance

27
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:26,340
so this is whatever courts here this is
from sons is the art of war

28
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,740
you know the enemy No yourself enough
for the result a hundred battles

29
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,079
if you know yourself but not the enemy
for every victory gained will be still

30
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,869
suffer defeat

31
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:36,900
and if you know neither the enemy No
yourself you'll see come in every battle

32
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,079
or Lehman stern's know thyself know thy
enemy so here it is 2500 years ago but

33
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,829
it is true then as it is today

34
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:47,220
and this can be essence of information
security and why we have to be threat

35
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,679
modeling

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,100
so what is start modeling

37
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,780
it's basically we're anticipating
possible tax and figure out ways to fix

38
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,329
this

39
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,009
so you know I think we've all had that
look there that beaters got that

40
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,930
you know when your car got towed at two
in the morning when you're at the strip

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,740
club kinda like

42
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,969
and last month that's another story
Taylor

43
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:10,119
the so you know the primary goal here is
to figure out

44
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,660
you know how we can be attacked and then
you know how you are prioritizing to fix

45
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,209
this

46
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,080
so I use the term Death Star threat
modeling because it's really easy for

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,920
people to grasp

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
its it's it's a common memory everybody
shares that we all we all

49
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,319
dunno as soon as we say that term but
we're talking about and I view this for

50
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,450
years at the you know my troops the
military in the mind you know my

51
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,060
coworkers now to explain

52
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,940
what these things are gonna fix peoples
around the terms threat and risk all the

53
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,670
time that

54
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,970
own ago driving on the highway is risky
well I mean that doesn't mean the same

55
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,470
things it doesn't information security
they have very specific in

56
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,989
worse so it's really good get around the
same pace over in a room with somebody

57
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:46,830
and they say

58
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,870
you know that if is arguing use a threat
to you

59
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,349
mean when I mean when I say threat and
you know this right here I'm sure I'll

60
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,060
remember this game this is Cody essence
we're talking about you know

61
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,610
what's the chance to the X-wing getting
a proton torpedo to go down a little

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,849
so

63
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,909
this is a basics a decir threat modeling

64
00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,609
suffers of every asset that's a valuable
resource right this should be your

65
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,900
your application your website's I the
program a coating what have you

66
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,750
and as a vulnerability which is an
exploitable weakness

67
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,069
in this case it's the exhaust port city
then put a screen ever

68
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,940
and then there's a threat

69
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,970
that something is going to come in and
it's going to try to do harm

70
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,220
its gonna try to exploit that
vulnerability sit in the risk

71
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,260
is the chance of that occurring so
what's a chance proton torpedoes gonna

72
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,649
hit

73
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,370
the Walters is actually gonna go down in
the hole and lastly

74
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,860
a countermeasure that something that you
put in place to reduce the risk

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,500
and this you know in a sense is

76
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,010
threat modeling but in this context you
know we diesel Star Wars

77
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,379
clipart tell because remember let's
write these down

78
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:58,409
your asset is anything with value no
value compete perceived or can be

79
00:03:58,409 --> 00:03:59,359
literal value

80
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,620
so there's things that I i you may
consider you know a commodity a resource

81
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:03,989
like

82
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:07,280
you know disk space for your IP
addresses or something like that you

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,260
know to an attacker

84
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,069
these can you know these have value to
them because they can leverage Institute

85
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:13,310
other nasty things

86
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,790
you know basically if it's worth having
is worth protecting in Vegas for

87
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,489
everything

88
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,590
bone abilities

89
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,750
this is exploitable weakness it's
something and that's not supposed to be

90
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,240
there

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,330
and it can hurt you that's that's that's
the bottom line

92
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,109
so this can come to form a pun intended
functionality bugs glitches airs these

93
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,370
are things that happen

94
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,490
that you didn't expect to happen or
intend to happen

95
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,009
versus intended functionality which is
design flaws you know assumptions in the

96
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:40,949
code

97
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,050
oh well you know I never occurred to me
that they could use that portion in my

98
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,840
application to hurt me or somebody else

99
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,070
these are still vulnerabilities whether
night I United it it's a it's a glitch

100
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,020
on hair

101
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,030
threats this is what is causing harm

102
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,040
they can be person it can be manmade it
can be. natural a national disaster is a

103
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,080
threat

104
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,330
you know maybe not something that we
always think about when we i looking

105
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,800
information systems but

106
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,910
you know i i you know each factory fire
suppression

107
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,919
you know ups is those cuttings are
countermeasures to

108
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,639
natural disasters and it really doesn't
matter with the intent to death threat

109
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:14,990
is

110
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,160
I you know it can be the insider threat
somebody's intensely trying to hurt you

111
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,370
doing it manually

112
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,550
it can be automated somebody just
thinking sweet what have you so it

113
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,979
doesn't matter if it's chosen
indiscriminate yeah it's all a threat

114
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:29,990
and then the rest again that's the
likelihood that the threat's going to

115
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,350
cause harm

116
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,820
so the lawsuit occurred here that you
know that threat probability plus the

117
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,370
severity the vulnerability equals your
amount of risk

118
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,400
so the more likely something has to
happen and the

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,139
do worse it will be if that thing
happens the more rescue house

120
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,759
and you just remember you always have a
risk in any system

121
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,479
did if you didn't have risked being you
basically would have a system

122
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,590
so you're not gonna have anything that
has no user action

123
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,400
that is an online that is and storing
something that's have some value

124
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,819
if he did do you know be a
self-contained running thing

125
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,410
so countermeasure these are the controls
that reduce Chris to an acceptable level

126
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,190
that's the key word is acceptable

127
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,810
you never going to get reverse you're
always going to have risk there's always

128
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,300
gonna be things you're not going to know
that are gonna hurt you

129
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,410
but the basic and easy way to balance it
against both the risk

130
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,569
and the asset so beautiful said okay
here the

131
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:25,120
the cost to the control you know that is
whatever is we're implementing

132
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,160
has to be less than or equal to the
asset otherwise it's not worth it you

133
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,380
know when I could spend

134
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,759
you don million dollars to protect
something worth 100 and then at the

135
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,289
protection that we're implementing

136
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:37,990
has to be. you know stronger release
equal to

137
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:43,400
the risk that's happening you otherwise
it's not worth it and so

138
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,330
so how do we use threat modeling okay
this is just the the basic Hero five

139
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,340
step process the first thing is
identifying critical resources

140
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,020
you gotta know what you have for gonna
protected so then you'll figure out you

141
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,469
know how to be harm stolen broken what
have you and so these again are your

142
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,449
assets in your gonna bilities

143
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:04,919
now at critical resources is a is
completely yunus objectives it was

144
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,180
critical that one person one systems are
critical to another

145
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,800
you know you know you start thinking
about you know you gotta a web

146
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,479
applications you got there

147
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,758
you know the the web where to get two
routers and servers and database layer

148
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,289
then the backup and you know

149
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:20,150
so that you have to make some surgeons
from nation which of those is the most

150
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,650
critical

151
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,319
you know if something's gotta go down
which one can I can I i

152
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,560
except and into is the best guess is
what's gonna cause harm

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,699
she's got a look at these took a
resource and say okay what where the

154
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,849
possible threats to my webserver

155
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,080
you know I United hit by flood a kidney
dialysis services except for such

156
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,169
knees are what your threats and risks
are

157
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:45,849
next one attorney every possible way
preventing or reducing the damage

158
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:49,169
and compare the cost implementation we
talk to counter measures and against

159
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,520
brainstorm so

160
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,068
you sit there think okay so I'm I'm
worried that some is good ol service my

161
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:56,610
web applications so what are the things
I can do in

162
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:00,430
well united to load balancing act to do
some sort of this or that or you know I

163
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,690
could just take the thing off line

164
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:04,819
better than that anyway stopping Iran so

165
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:07,990
but then the sep four we want to
implement the best controller and

166
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,520
evaluate right so it

167
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,639
my e-commerce site is taking an offline
the best solution to that problem

168
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,440
so maybe not so then we wanna documents
there those results and lessons learned

169
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,009
you know so you know I do your IT staff
I found out that taking the web server

170
00:08:21,009 --> 00:08:22,710
offline is not the best idea

171
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,590
said in the most important part a step
5: is continue process improvement is to

172
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,849
take what you learned

173
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:33,760
go back and do it all over again

174
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,159
so now let's let's get to identify all
the parts we just talked about

175
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,958
so asset management is key here you know
you gotta know what you have again

176
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,440
where it's located at you know who's
responsible for it

177
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,350
how do we get another one you know if
the server goes offline too can we get a

178
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,779
second summer

179
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:54,450
and only result in a false in securities
that idea well you know that happens

180
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,300
other people you know nobody will attack
my system you know you we we'd argue

181
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,589
that if you have a system

182
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,529
its online accepts these rent but it's
gonna be attacked

183
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,310
vote abilities knows the the hard thing
to find his cuz if you knew there was a

184
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,649
vulnerability there

185
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,959
you would have to look for it you know
you could probably fix it

186
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,019
so it the hard part here's we're trying
to find something that may or may not

187
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,680
exist

188
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,480
so we want to both look at it internally
and externally doing things like

189
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,870
penetration testing

190
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,730
you know white box backpack scanning
looking at for the Securities now to

191
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,640
looking into the inside looking out

192
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,959
source code analysis looking at it on in
both the static and dynamic state you

193
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,260
know

194
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,209
executing the code are also looking at
the code itself for flaws

195
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,860
and again you know back to send so you
have to know yourself and the enemy CNN

196
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,490
know what you know what's in it what you
have going on here in system

197
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,779
so identifying threats you never going
to know all the threats that are out

198
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:46,990
there

199
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:50,360
you know that I mean the your the best
thing you do is make best guess you know

200
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,740
educated guess

201
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,089
yes stay current you know whether you're
a current events read the blogs form

202
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,360
post what have you

203
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,310
and blessings be proactive don't wait
till you're attacked don't wait till

204
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,370
somebody you know

205
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,589
hits you before you do something

206
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:07,690
and then I identify areas with us a try
at

207
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,529
is affected and this is kinda Lake the
sick information security 101 kinda

208
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,439
concept

209
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,970
is just to see i sense for
confidentiality availability integrity

210
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:20,430
so when you're looking at your system
think okay where in my system is

211
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,839
confidentiality important

212
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,370
my storing something that other people
wouldn't wanna see passwords credit

213
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,010
cards phone number so security what have
you

214
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,480
you know how can that confidentiality be
compromised

215
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,360
integrity are people relying on at my
system and the data it serves

216
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,730
to to be. I to be

217
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,529
what it's supposed to be and is there
some sort of assumption

218
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:48,050
her reliability involved you know so if
I'm if I'm ordering a product on the day

219
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,380
I

220
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,939
you know I wanna make sure that that is
the actual product and you know it's not

221
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,279
something false

222
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,550
and then availability you know this is
done I'll service wanna make sure that

223
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,750
these assets are there women are

224
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,760
you know our customers our clients you
know what them to be there

225
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,930
so it's kinda makes up the DCI triad so
when you eat the talk about information

226
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,850
security concepts like take photography
for instance

227
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,279
photography always enhances
confidentiality because you're making it

228
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,930
your more private enhances the integrity
in the sense that

229
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,910
it's been a cryptid sue you know he's
like Ekin digital signage stuff you can

230
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,000
you can assume that hadn't you know Tam
needed en route

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,440
by its photography by only ever hamper
availability you can't pick up something

232
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,079
to make it more easy access

233
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,170
so these are just kinda like you know
ideas concepts wanna keep in mind when

234
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,979
you look at these things

235
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,610
so it ain't propagation analysis agree
second set

236
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:46,209
to handle that the name there there is
always you know giggles and reset

237
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:49,560
C-one Asuna all user input is tainted

238
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,600
so easiest way to find a little easier
system is a look at it

239
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
and figure out where stuff's coming in
and we're stuff's going out and those

240
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,490
your own abilities

241
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,810
if you can accept these are employed it
would run exactly as a supposed to run

242
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,700
there be no problem

243
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,829
this is an example here from other this
company called fortify their sys

244
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:12,139
a source code analysis offer Anna here's
an example of a legal taint analysis so

245
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,810
you know if you're the top are taking in
a his arguments being stored

246
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,820
here's our kids in his arguments being
passed as username string

247
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,839
and then that's being concatenated with
this sequel like statements for this

248
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,889
query string

249
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:28,300
and that's being executed right that
seems perfectly fine right

250
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,720
so I put him bob Bob gets you know
densely transferred and your query and

251
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,750
then executes looks for username and
password

252
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,339
with bob reich no problem but what if it
but bob semi colon and something bad

253
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:39,889
afterwards you know that's the essence

254
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:43,550
the command injection attack so again
this is a very basic

255
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,630
you know academic example but this is
the kinda stuff you wanna do you want to

256
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,529
look

257
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:50,850
you know where the suffering in where's
bouncing around internally and what

258
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,100
happens to it once it's in there

259
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,010
a good example I was working with one of
our developers and they had this I

260
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,860
dis base a backup system any ideas along
this application get a credentials do we

261
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,670
go now to drive somewhere

262
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:07,209
using his credentials back up whatever
needed to endure them out

263
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,420
oh that's great to start asking you know
okay so where's the where's the

264
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,750
credentials stored

265
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,450
okay well there a database ready secure
your interested cáceres talk about you

266
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,810
know where the stuff is when I'm

267
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,089
and eventually realize that well the
logging is set by for both for example

268
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,740
for by default as long as verbose and
the application is actually doing

269
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,720
command line connections

270
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,800
so those credentials are in the log
files

271
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,240
so that's probably not a good thing you
know so that that's the idea

272
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,910
you know you wanna look where the stuff
that's going into your application where

273
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,160
it ins up

274
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,269
and how it is handled and this brings us
to

275
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:45,680
the second estar and we're talk about
dependencies

276
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,209
so not only do we have to worry about
you know the the user inputs for taking

277
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,779
be we gotta worry about any third
parties that are so she did you know

278
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:55,180
with our application

279
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,579
so the Empire try to learn a lesson from
the first one Sony have a second estar

280
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,000
rebels going to blow it up this time
they're prepared they had

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,560
you know I third-party dependency here
with the children at an indoor

282
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,529
right and this you know that was their
countermeasure

283
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:14,490
ramp and the idea here is that this
reduce the risk

284
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,110
you know from from the one involving
coming and right but the problem here is

285
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,079
that

286
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:22,120
the dependency is now a link is now a
link in a chain

287
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,000
you know the old cliche that really
strong as the weakest link well that was

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,320
the case here because

289
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,720
your dependency is a system and that
system has countermeasures

290
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,850
and at the systems has countermeasures
that's because there's threats to that

291
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:40,850
system

292
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,360
so essentially what happens is by having
a dependency

293
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,709
you inherit their threats so what
happens when your dependencies counter

294
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,760
measure fails

295
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,180
than those threats can exploit that
dependency the Tennessee goes offline

296
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,980
and I restrict your risk is high you
know and this is all because you know

297
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,220
you're assuming

298
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,930
bad your this dependency is going to be
secure

299
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,850
and that's bad assumption you know if
it's beyond your control don't trust it

300
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,079
just like user input

301
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,860
he shouldn't trust a dependency

302
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,019
so identify these risks and is a calm
and you know a

303
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,620
Foursquare you know matrix thing in
three scenes 102 times

304
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,690
but it is a helpful tool you know I see
look at you to probability own axis

305
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,899
severity another

306
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,089
and he just starts throwing bone
abilities and your wrists and threats

307
00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:31,440
against it and see where they land

308
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,310
you know so you category 1 get low
probability low severity

309
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,980
like information disclosure oh I go to
the website and now for the address

310
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,019
you know it gives me a professor message
back from the server

311
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:45,170
not a good thing but you know it's it's
not the end of the world

312
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,639
category to get low probability high
severity you know this is this is again

313
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,050
the National Disaster

314
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,410
it could happen and I always a lot of
time on it maybe not you know getting a

315
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,060
check system I'm gonna have insurance
gonna have

316
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,060
you know fire suppression and what not
but you know it's in the grand scheme of

317
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,699
things it's gonna come secondary to most
other stuff

318
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,839
category 3 high probability low severity
so is gonna be like spam

319
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,350
yelping sweet sports cans I kinda stuff
it happens

320
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,920
is it a big deal by self not really it
is something we gotta look at but Mike

321
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,240
Reiss too much time on

322
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,449
and a category for high probability high
severity this is like a major design

323
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:19,940
flaw

324
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,750
this is a problem and you know so if you
have something like that that's that's

325
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:30,100
when you gotta stop things in USA let's
let's reevaluate discuss

326
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,370
several Zinda strident to read these are
our two

327
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,959
techniques you know that they're def not
the end all be all but that their tools

328
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:37,970
that you can use

329
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,240
to categorize risks and threats is the
kinda stuff that we see we do like

330
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,470
I'm consulting reports is I you know
telling him that you're

331
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,519
that this is secure is is really a
qualitative measure is a measure quality

332
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,279
its good works bat is on for
quantitative

333
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,170
is we can say well it's eighty percent
secure so this is a way above can have

334
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,130
given people who are comfortable with
numbers numbers

335
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,910
so if we look at a a particular your
threat or risk

336
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,569
suffered read for instance you know we
say oh well use an arbitrary numbers

337
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:12,359
doesn't matter could be 1 313 510
doesn't matter

338
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,179
to sign some sort of levels yet for this
particular attack you know has a

339
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:20,169
you know wanna a level i won't. 30 has a
3-for-10 ChanServ

340
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:24,669
you know our damage the reproducibility
the two you can get sometimes can't at

341
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,400
all times the discover bill it is real
low

342
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,360
you know it's really hard from the
finally have the spare you know compared

343
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,059
with like

344
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:33,580
yes something they may be really easy to
discover but has a low amount of damage

345
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,399
any average altogether see have some
sort of quantifiable number that you can

346
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,480
compare to another one and say okay
should probably look at this one first

347
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,100
before you move on to this one

348
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,380
and then stride is just a way of
categorizing define a taxi now

349
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,990
is it is spoofing attack is a tampering
you know some things are going to be you

350
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,230
know multiple ones

351
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,940
and again you sign arbitrary numbers
average it gives you something to work

352
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,530
from

353
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,720
you know for for pride doors in
categorizing stuff

354
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,140
risk management so we have this risk

355
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,220
it's never gonna go away so we got a
deal with it okay

356
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,220
the montel marchers acre is gotta deal
with the fact

357
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,850
that he's gonna get blown out of the sky
okay so what is he going to do with that

358
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,669
you know so you can accept it you can
transfer you can mitigate

359
00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:21,750
thank so we can accept the risk is
basically gambling this is saying you

360
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,890
know I know there's a risk

361
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,000
I know it's bad I know it could happen
but you know I can live with the OCZ

362
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,900
and some people call this wrist in I'll
in saying that okay I know there's a

363
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,590
risk

364
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,340
but I don't believe it's as bad as you
think it is

365
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:39,000
II can I think that's a bad way of
looking at it um

366
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,860
so than you can transfer the risk now
this can be like it literal transfer in

367
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,660
you know %ah I wanna set up in my
e-commerce site I'm a total I don't know

368
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,720
anything about web server so I'm going
to have a outsource I'm going to have a

369
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,530
hosting company

370
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:55,470
deal with the problems %uh the routers
and firewalls and all that stuff

371
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,960
or this could be like insurance you know
I know there's a risk I know something

372
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,120
bad to happen so

373
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,940
I'm gonna take out insurance in case it
does so that way you know i i can

374
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,960
mitigate how much damage is gonna cause
because they're not pay for

375
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,610
and the third way mitigation this is
probably the best idea you know try the

376
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:18,610
best you can to reduce the threat again
to an acceptable level

377
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,539
and this wasn't a countermeasure so
countermeasures are going to be what you

378
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:24,770
used to mitigate that risk right they
have to be cost-effective again

379
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,510
we're not gonna spend more money you now
raises no money to fix something you

380
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,770
know we're not gonna have

381
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,980
a 24-hour armed guard to protect the
snack bar thanks

382
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:37,299
so the right tool for the job you know
were i you know again this goes with the

383
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,049
the panacea there's no one fixed
everything

384
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:42,870
yeltsin your people say well I got a
farm alright that's gonna protect me

385
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,580
rank

386
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,649
well you know from some things as I can
protect you from your sequel chechen

387
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,240
attack

388
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,160
you know cuz you're asking people to
come to your website so you gotta make

389
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,470
sure that your countermeasure

390
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,340
you know is actually works with what
you're trying to prevent

391
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,899
and then proportionality you know it
does is no need in overkill here

392
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,470
again you know we gotta a spam message
from it take my e-commerce I offline

393
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:09,289
you know that's overkill in a sense

394
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:13,340
so how to integrate this into a suffered
on the life cycle

395
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,199
said typically in suffered on it UC
security can just tacked on at the end

396
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,510
you know the guys build it you get some
testing stage and then there's some sort

397
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,340
of security testing egos involved

398
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,139
or you know okay let's invite a guy from
security curve over to sit in our Q&A

399
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,440
session

400
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,840
right but the idea here is we really
integrate this thing in the life cycle

401
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,240
from start to finish

402
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,669
um you know so easy the initial
requirements gathering yard

403
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:40,850
does the same have to be reached ETPs
you know you know I restoring something

404
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,200
on a sensitive how sensitive is it

405
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,570
do you have any sort is on regulatory
compliance hit the socks I kinda stuff

406
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,580
let me get a coded in a UN didn't like
the source code and how society said

407
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:53,580
your desk Jets have other people look
through it step through it

408
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,860
again with testing your eyes and a
security there and then you know finally

409
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,020
with you know implementation and
deployment system

410
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,980
so here's an example love AI a security
and the suffering on the life cycle

411
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,900
yes i know its Microsoft by yet this is
actually a pretty good thing at the

412
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,780
implemented

413
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:15,620
yeah they kinda realize that you know
they're their operating systems stuff

414
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,630
words

415
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,700
they wanted the the criminal crop you
know the there are prettier dogs at the

416
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,520
show

417
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,450
so the the this this guy Michael Howard
the third link here I highly recommend

418
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,039
this

419
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,408
he literally wrote the book on secure
getting its called secure coding

420
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,470
and this guy

421
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,159
really is and on imagine if Simon Calif
American Idol

422
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,760
was a corporate security guy that's
that's Michael Howard

423
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,690
so he basically sat down and said okay
we need to do something and during the

424
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,679
development think is this is ridiculous

425
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,059
have to pass all the stuff afterwards on
so this is kinda the security the life

426
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:54,690
cycle that they came up with

427
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,820
so every time they develop a new thing
Microsoft the

428
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,379
run through this process CNC the first
step is training

429
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,159
so these are countries that have been
there for who knows how long but every

430
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,960
time a certain process the required to
go to security training

431
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,280
but that's a good thing you know because
you're never gonna to be you never gonna

432
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,770
be aware

433
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,900
everything gotta stay current with the
thing with a will the security

434
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,299
developments

435
00:22:16,299 --> 00:22:19,889
you see you then you know they go hidden
analyze a risky and design the threat

436
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,429
modeling

437
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:24,409
you see I'm not making this up it's
right here you know they specify tools

438
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,940
and he goes on throughout the life cycle

439
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,610
there's white papers and all kinds
examples out the web-sites here they

440
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,490
talk about

441
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,260
it got some metrics that you know we
reduce the amount over

442
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,490
you know one-year patches by seventy
percent or when I they there there's

443
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,940
different things that they have a
website

444
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,919
you know that kind of validates the fact
that all this works

445
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,659
so here's my favorite example real-world
threat modeling

446
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,919
site a 6-year-old daughter and we got
for this thing called

447
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,940
alphabet now and its members company
called leapfrog

448
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,210
i mix of these educational toys so it's
got these

449
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,289
aces got the letter feel on the bottom
any furloughs a switch there to remote

450
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:03,210
at the letter to ABC

451
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,770
but another wanna play songs well what
are the mods this fanatics

452
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:11,408
and see you put it on the switching hit
efficace and hit caning as

453
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:15,870
any hit s in a gauche and hit seeing a
ghost town 30 gonna this

454
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,610
so one day she's just like matching he's
on a thing and I hear ago he he that

455
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,409
tickles

456
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:25,390
I think what was that about so I think
the thing up nicer person things in

457
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,360
I relies on certain combinations are
patterns it it laughed

458
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,220
and so I started looking at him or you
know being ya troublemaker I started

459
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,390
like Transpo curse words and whenever I
put in that last

460
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,760
letter he laughed at me

461
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,860
and you know and that those kinda
disconcerting at a little toy

462
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,120
new in a so it was like you know F

463
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,940
you see an alas and other people Anna UK
at last I like

464
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,690
women somebody threat model this
somebody sat down

465
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,289
and five that this would happen so
through my own testing and blogs

466
00:24:02,289 --> 00:24:09,289
I found this blacklist I'm sure there's
more out there

467
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,510
if you need if you need any these
explains to me afterwards I can let you

468
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:21,710
in on the joke

469
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,360
button my favorite here's the last ones
you got

470
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,429
if chuck is blacklisted all I can think
I guess they don't kid like critiquing

471
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,289
the mom's cooking or something

472
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:35,390
I am not really sure why that's their on
whatever this one blogger somebody tried

473
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,320
over 50 racial slurs and they all went
through

474
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,689
so at least they're like an equal
opportunity United

475
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,770
is so but yeah I mean this is this is a
whole areas that some guy

476
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:50,010
as far as jobs sat down in threat model
this

477
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,340
you know this is what they considered a
problem you know

478
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,418
at all I can imagine my head is that
they can in turn to do it

479
00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:00,240
is a sound that kinda work you give an
intern and you know especially like you

480
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,570
really good in turn when those guys you
give a project and they do it

481
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,779
like a thousand times better than you'd
assume anybody in the company would ever

482
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:07,929
do it

483
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:11,730
you know cuz if you gave us so elite a
regular salary guy you know

484
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,860
bottom of the barrel you can work area
but this is a perfect example a threat

485
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,720
model

486
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,130
so the key points you know the the
takeaways here is that you know you

487
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,690
wanna know yourself know the enemy

488
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,950
again back to sun sea again you wanna
never trust these reports are

489
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,130
dependencies

490
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,640
a yes it's a you know

491
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,860
did they are the enemy that's the best
way to think about you're just always

492
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,730
default to that assumption

493
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,059
and see what the terms again at CIA
triad confidentiality integrity

494
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,408
availability

495
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:45,659
and again the most important part the
rebels were terrorists

496
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:50,070
while it lacked the Empire and I realize
I talked way too fast

497
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:54,120
so there are any questions discussions

498
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,500
sure some are anecdotes about toys

499
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,710
and apparently that toys they are
there's newer models out there are some

500
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,640
video on YouTube just the other day of a
new one

501
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,289
actually will spell the words and then
there's like there are some operates I

502
00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:10,230
don't know if they have a

503
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,940
they they redid the from where or what
not but yes and it's now barely there

504
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,600
are some that can curse

505
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,049
so we got the if you google it on
YouTube um I think whatever it's called

506
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,260
like

507
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,650
feck a pillar something like that are
her if you see

508
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:27,039
