1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,090
me

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,410
yeah

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:08,190
for school %uh

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,990
slow

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,710
do

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,230
this

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:21,700
world

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,310
housing

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,260
alright we'll get started here just a
second just a reminder

10
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,920
thank you I'm DVD sales have all the
discussions are on sale in the vendor

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,120
area right out here

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,419
I'm on the eighteenth floor if you
haven't been down to the second floor

13
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,630
there's a lot going on down there people

14
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,160
soldering things taking things apart
lots of stuff for sale

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,879
on agents steele's book books are on
sale

16
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,710
and the DVD area as well and he's giving
like some kind of eighteen-hour

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,740
marathon discussion that starts at
midnight tonight and

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,700
don't forget the fourth track which is
the room down the hall you can sign up

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,079
and give your own discussion will be
announcing those

20
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,100
I'll as the day goes on stuff like
stackoverflow and exploits

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,040
and hack in the NYC power grid which is
good for blackouts I suppose

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,310
and but let's get going now with these
guys

23
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,850
I'm you seen them into a lot of the
whole conferences skip Joe

24
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:23,800
land and burning yes this is off the
grid voice data communications

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,800
taking to bring

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:36,360
sure furnished also so first of all this
is this is an incredibly vast

27
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,970
top its it's going to be really
difficult for us to call the cover

28
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,840
anything in that

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,850
this is going to be an overview of a lot
of the technologies that you guys news

30
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,210
for communications without

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,659
any infrastructure at all are so we're
gonna be talking about various types

32
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:48,880
radios to methods

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,908
with which they work and and some other
things that you can do to get started

34
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:54,100
with 3 Communications

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,360
so in in summer these we put in some

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,350
some tiny URL's so if you see a little
bit a text with some big letters next to

37
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,260
it that's

38
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,180
the big letters are its last tiny you
know tiny or else last

39
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,690
that's that sent a letter so there
something that intrigues you

40
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,739
like like joe said his this is just

41
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,489
skimming over the top four dollars out
there and definitely not getting into

42
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:19,420
any detail about how it works

43
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,440
or issues and Boehner abilities or
problems with it in

44
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,320
and things like that okay so so how many
of you guys are our ham radio operators

45
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,530
are have any spoke a while

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,000
we have a good amount alright okay so so
all of us up here are as well so

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,099
so where with we're coming %uh primarily
from the aspect of ham radio operators

48
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,310
but we're gonna try to cover a lot of
the part 15 stuff as well and and just

49
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,260
give you guys some theory on how it all
works

50
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,609
%uh so at you wanna go explain some
other

51
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,180
oh yeah on since a nice percentage if
you are amateur radio operators and

52
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,700
we really encourage you to to get your
ham radio license

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,220
which you can get really easily Sunday
morning at the heavy

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,620
volunteer examination session on the six
floor ten o'clock Sunday morning

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,800
come the elevator I it's on the wiki the
FEC

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,110
just got the 64 Sunday morning and you
pay fourteen dollars which is

57
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,790
the FCC approved price whichever and
pass it he had even a smattering of

58
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:15,760
technical knowledge

59
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,090
and on if you go to the hope wiki
there's a

60
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,099
a link to all the actual questions and
answers used on the FCC exam

61
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,599
so these memorizing your your your
passes think I mean is

62
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,790
its its its arm the

63
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,209
if you have technical background
technical knowledge in your view some of

64
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,239
those questions

65
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,709
for that for the technician exam have a
high likelihood a passing it dropped

66
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:40,260
fourteen dollars give it a shot

67
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,109
see how it goes if not then you've you
know what to expect come back and do it

68
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,730
another time

69
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,370
it's not necessary to have a ham radio
license to

70
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,450
due to a communications on there's a lot
of options available

71
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:57,200
to to unlicensed individuals on were you
talk about some of them to since

72
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
the majority of the people here not
places hams yet

73
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,159
so on I just wanna go over some the
categories yes

74
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,799
ten years ten years now you might be
able to get a roll call sign back

75
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,800
but you have to retake the exams

76
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,280
alright calm as far as communications
options available to

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,550
everyday folks to mainly have been have
any a

78
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,889
experience Rica vacations or cut ham
radio license

79
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,000
you probably see walkie-talkies and
other things like that a bill

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,419
in retail stores and they the phone turf
several different categories at the FCC

81
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,260
has allocated frequencies for

82
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,349
on most common you've probably seen it
is it'll Family Radio Service radios are

83
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,080
FRS

84
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,659
they operate on UHF frequencies around
six 460 megahertz

85
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,880
up there fairly low power maybe half a
water show in might give you a range

86
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,080
from Myler show

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,409
on user really commonly used they're not
legally use for business but the family

88
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,290
is by families hence the name of the
service Family Radio Service

89
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,460
they're also the use a light by
activists unfortunately the very easy to

90
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,159
monitor

91
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,490
so on if you if you're in in for

92
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:13,880
involved in any kind of a direct actions
and your

93
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,090
your group using Family Radio Sirius
radio's you can be sure that the police

94
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,510
are my

95
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,780
his communications and maybe even a
misdirecting them jamming them that sort

96
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,650
of thing I've seen this happen in
philadelphia

97
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,720
on there are that good example other

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,120
inexpensive Family Radio Service radio I
think this a for five dollars at a

99
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,710
a drugstore so they're very inexpensive
on

100
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,070
they're just good for quick and dirty
communications they're not secure

101
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,080
they're fairly short range maybe half a
mile a mile or so but

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,280
it's just something you use I'm there's

103
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,320
higher there's there's those are a some
the Family Radio Service frequencies

104
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,650
and there's a URL at the bottom there
the five

105
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:59,260
KRP you a check that workers

106
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,479
yeah there's a there's another category
for

107
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,750
radio service at the SEC is authorized
more recently called rumors

108
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,490
forget the acronym stands for multi-use
radio service or something

109
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,160
there on VHF frequency bottom line is
there a little more power

110
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,800
think about you what's and they can now
to give you more range

111
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,910
and they are are you can use them
legally for business purposes

112
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:26,870
unlike FRS they're on their band FM

113
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,849
which bottom line means on the fidelity
is in

114
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,969
high fidelity like I can FM broadcast
station but it's perfectly

115
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,680
understandable

116
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,979
there's also that the services general
mobile radio service has been around for

117
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:38,740
decades

118
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,289
they're also in a UHF frequency some of
which are shared by the Family Radio

119
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:42,979
Service

120
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,060
and these require 85 valid license from
the FCC

121
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,260
there's also F GMR space stations are
available

122
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,229
up to 50 watts in power so they're also
grr sir Peter's so

123
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:58,710
people in it in a community could to
communicate you know

124
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:03,419
20-30 miles away with that your message
GMRS repeater a mountaintop but again

125
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:04,510
they require license

126
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:09,440
utmost the that cheap grâce sheep F FRS
radios you buy in stores

127
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,430
also have some humorous frequencies in
there your final note in the manual and

128
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,539
very tiny print saying to use the GMRS
frequencies you must have an FCC license

129
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:21,250
but 7 but almost nobody does this so the
GRS

130
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,710
people are kinda upset that the FBI for
s radios have

131
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,419
serve moved in on their band time

132
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:32,159
via you might have seen some other hope

133
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:35,450
staff members walking around with
two-way radios and the ones you're

134
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,479
seeing picture here

135
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,150
are what we're using on these are made
in China

136
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,560
and they're designed to be with Motorola
who started the Kenyan ready

137
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,050
communications equipment for

138
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,510
government military and a these these
radios operate over a very wide

139
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,610
frequency range

140
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,690
their 45 watchin power to bring in with
you using a UHF VHF frequency

141
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,640
the programmable with PC on and they
also has an interesting features

142
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,710
his 16 channels you can you could
literally program any other 16 chance to

143
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,430
be any one of thousands of different
frequencies

144
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,000
one additional features the israelis the
invoice some some form for voice privacy

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,750
something called a inversion scrambling
it's not super secure

146
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,130
but it makes the a casual listener with
the radio scanner unable to listen

147
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,419
to communications and death be the

148
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,570
we we are really that paranoid about
that here the conference but didn't cost

149
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,700
anything to program it featured these
radios so

150
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,219
so we did that so those of you who are
trying to listen to us and

151
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:36,208
weren't able to that's why and

152
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:40,099
this is the newest most interesting
option available to unlicensed

153
00:08:40,099 --> 00:08:43,419
radio operator Sina in this country I
think on

154
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,380
the FCC has a whole category love
unlicensed

155
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,939
radio services called part 15 just body
blog part 15

156
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,660
and one other services the assembly
service wanted the wanted the rules they

157
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,400
passed and regulations is that

158
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,500
two-way radios can using some summer the
unlicensed bands in the 900 megahertz

159
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,350
band

160
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,730
the 2.4 gigahertz ban in the 5-1 hey
kicker expand

161
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,949
on can use frequency hopping

162
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,740
on which means that the channel changes
a very rapidly several times a second

163
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,790
makes it hard for someone else to listen
to it also remake reduces the chance

164
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,209
over

165
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,730
interference from from another user to
to almost nothing

166
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,140
on these radios from a company called
try square

167
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,579
came out about a year and a half ago and
a

168
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:38,730
gonna put one from up there is that this

169
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,700
here okay

170
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,350
these things are really need com you get
a pair of these

171
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,690
with dropping Chargers and voice
operated headsets

172
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,030
for 80 bucks on Amazon there one what

173
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,880
900 megahertz and the neat thing about
these this one of the things about this

174
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,200
this radio is a you can program the
frequency hopping pattern

175
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,520
into this using a 10-digit number is now
the rhythm in there

176
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,900
on you choose attend his number can be
like phone number whatever

177
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:12,240
and unless someone else knows that ended
number it's been a very difficult for

178
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:12,740
them to be

179
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,550
hear that communication so if you're
with an activist group

180
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,560
were you running a business you don't
want others to overhear your

181
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,630
conversations

182
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:25,570
or meteor your favorite fishing spot you
know anybody here were you talking about

183
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,580
where the fish are

184
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,310
that's your thing on it users with a pH
your fish with the No

185
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,560
yeah exactly on

186
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,250
these it's not encrypted in its not
trippin its frequency hopping so

187
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,330
theoretically it is possible to you

188
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,750
did determine hopping sequence if there
aren't a lot easier in the band

189
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,150
but its its Hin that's akin to
encryption

190
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:51,560
on because there's so many different
virtual channels

191
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,690
literally 10 billion channel
possibilities

192
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,030
fifty you seven hundred different
frequencies in the 900 megahertz band

193
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,819
on but on those the different hopping
sequences between is absent

194
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,450
I took one four times per second on make
it virtually impossible for someone with

195
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:10,700
a

196
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:15,160
with unless you're government or or have
a lot of resources your disposal

197
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,140
or maybe a few thousand dollars to buy
EDS number to find review the radio

198
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,830
project were demonstrating at the WH
station yesterday

199
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,270
on in share lottery sources in time on
your hands

200
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,350
it be very difficult to monitor these on
and for the price

201
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:32,940
you can't beat 'em on there's also some
things on the market called

202
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,450
simplex for Peters you can you can plug
a little box but the sizes

203
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,210
agassi grants into one of these radios
any the other areas such as shown

204
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,350
on and put it on a high point lead there
like the top at the hotel Pennsylvania

205
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:48,430
or om on a mountaintop or anywhere else

206
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:52,000
and and other people can't use that as
repeater to communicate

207
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,080
on over a wider distance so if

208
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,870
for the israelis were on top of a
mountain top pp you the top 20 30 40

209
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,970
miles away through this to someone else
equally far away

210
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:06,630
said so the only the only one of those
that legally you cannot do that on his

211
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,360
murders

212
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,030
the FCC specifically address that on
mars that they did not want

213
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,280
people building repeaters on mars
frequencies so

214
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,829
when it first came out they didn't have
that whole bunch people put up

215
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,680
the Spurs repeaters and a few people in
SEC was

216
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,210
went back and said now that this is not
what we intended yes

217
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,260
desi changes that's the only one the SEC
tends to change rules as they go along

218
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,580
that

219
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,390
it's the city on so check these things
out here to try square that US you can

220
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,120
read about selling them but on

221
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,130
I'll the company has donated a pair
these to give away the conference will

222
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,800
figure out a way the into the talk to

223
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,980
figure he's gonna is gonna get these
radios on

224
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,300
one last thing I want to talk about is a
is a

225
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,350
communicating to a large group of people
one way

226
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,610
on with the broadcasting

227
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:01,839
this device here is sort of informally
referred to is it grenade

228
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,790
it's a 10:1 shortwave radio transmitter

229
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,780
it operates are around a 6.9

230
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,290
55 megahertz but there's a crystal you
can see in the front you can plug in for

231
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,949
different frequencies this homemade

232
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:18,920
and a this particular transmitter was
used to

233
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,670
a while ago to make a broadcast which
was heard five hundred miles away in two

234
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,900
different directions

235
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,089
so you're talking about a diameter
broadcasting on a path

236
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,589
thousand miles not depending on the the
propagation conditions

237
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:36,940
this may or may not work on but this is
a technique used by intelligence

238
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,470
agencies around the world

239
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,510
to get messages not necessarily literal
low power transmitter like this

240
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,180
but higher pair transmitters
intelligence agencies used to broadcast

241
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,720
in cryptic messages

242
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,030
and five five-member group cycle
one-time pad encryption system

243
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,050
so if you need to get it if you if you
have like

244
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,140
group people around the country around
the world you want to get messages to

245
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,930
securely

246
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,610
use one-time pad encryption with a
low-power or even a Hi Power

247
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,740
surely transmitter you get that
information out to them and

248
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,040
fairly secure so on I would have more
questions than answers after the end and

249
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,560
at this time

250
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,200
they dont thats pretty much all I wanna
talk about I'm gonna go over a little

251
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,310
bit about how that actually worse if you
could see if you can switch back to bass

252
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,100
lines

253
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,480
okay so so the radio that he was
demonstrating before which are the

254
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,160
handheld radios operate in the VHF and
UHF frequencies which is probably

255
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,410
almost if you guys are familiar with a

256
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,459
cellular phones are a little bit about
that and arm

257
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:34,100
allowed the FRS radios are but they are
VHF you

258
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,160
VHF UHF radios so white when I was
talking about with a grenade

259
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,199
that's actually that section HF radio so
transmis on shortwave bands

260
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,970
which which arm actually have any
propagation characteristics

261
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,100
when when compared to the VHF and UHF
bands so

262
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,410
I actually when he when he's
transmitting with that grenade

263
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,829
transceiver and and people are hearing
it five hundred miles away urself

264
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:59,360
they're not actually hearing a we can
actually receiving a direct line of

265
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,860
sight from that transmit their actually
receiving a signal that bounced off

266
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,089
that the ionosphere back to earth
afghanis you're getting back to her

267
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,760
may be multiple times sometimes it's a
single-hop sometimes it's a few hops

268
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,050
but I the ionosphere is basically a
layer of the atmosphere way way way

269
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:18,810
up %ah in the outer atmosphere that that
has a particles they get

270
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:23,650
ionized by radiation from the Sun and it
basically creates a reflective layer at

271
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,290
different times during the day

272
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,730
and depending on the amount of solar
activity that's that's occurring at the

273
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,400
time

274
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,020
and allows different frequencies to to
reflector passed through

275
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,150
at various times in and at a frequency
that it was transmitting on

276
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,040
usually typically they open up at at at
night time that's that's very close to

277
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
the 40 meter ham radio band

278
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,930
so so it's a very good evening band and
if you transmit on that you're very

279
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,660
likely

280
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,319
with only a couple Watson what is that
if I were radio it's actually $10 whites

281
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,040
10 Maria

282
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,640
and I should point out that's not that
was not a legal broadcast this is

283
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,650
in leisure relations amateur radio
operator

284
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:01,319
you can't you can't do these tapes
transmissions on you actually can

285
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,920
broadcast on M Street anyway

286
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,570
you can't have intended 121
communication but on

287
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,070
so using something like this actually is
a legal such one mission

288
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,510
so so far so for instance you can
actually communicate all

289
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,069
all across well in this one of the
things that really interests me about

290
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,339
amateur radio is the fact that you can
be using

291
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:21,060
radios that are are less powerful than
some other hand how's that he was

292
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,810
demonstrating

293
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,540
that in the city only get you a couple
blocks are you can actually use

294
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:28,839
at lower frequencies to get you
literally around the world

295
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:33,110
soul so they're couple of other methods
a propagation that better use as well

296
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,730
and and

297
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,770
on VHF and UHF there's

298
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,760
there are some troops tropospheric modes
a which which will and the differences

299
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,970
in the index of refraction

300
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,750
various up layers because if he
differences and stuff like that actually

301
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,530
allowed VHF and UHF signal sick

302
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,870
to travel long distances and and and
what a lot of people use to do before

303
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,280
a well they won't be able to do after
2009 anyway but at with FM DX ng

304
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,079
I for seeking television signals out VHF
and UHF

305
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,510
signals from from cities many many miles

306
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,750
further than you normally be able to
receive on

307
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,750
the you know you can you can depend on
modes like this to it actually

308
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,869
on somewhat unreliable because they're
not

309
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:18,900
as predictable but but they they can
carry radio always much much further

310
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,320
than you would normally get

311
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,810
a strategy is another is another mode
which which relies on

312
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,948
very very densely I and ice patches in
the atmosphere

313
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:30,340
to carry VHF and UHF on signals

314
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,639
again in the same way that the NHS thing
as a typically carried

315
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,090
through DDF where the ionosphere I'm so

316
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,699
so every once in a while you you'll be
you'll be listening to you

317
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,160
a you know the two meter band or the 440
me to ban on

318
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,640
on the amateur radio a frequency
locations and you hear people from

319
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,179
you know around here you might hear
someone from a name I hear someone from

320
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:55,040
Maryland or something so somewhere that
you would

321
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,300
typically not be able to normally
receive and you can you can pretty much

322
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,950
bet that that would be something like

323
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:03,470
sporadic E or or or adopting more that's
that's actually

324
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,640
carrying that not that wave to you

325
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,490
so so another another thing that really
limits your ability to communicate

326
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,790
is the adsorption characteristics RF as
the frequency increases

327
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,139
so at age at HF you can

328
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,900
you can really rely on a lot of ground
ground wave propagation and

329
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,550
and propagation that's not really
interfered with by buildings

330
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,980
as much as VHF and UHF frequencies are
so for instance

331
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,020
communicating with the radio like this a
you know from here to you

332
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,290
maybe the second for or the lobby might
be a little bit difficult because all

333
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,300
all the all the obstructions in the wake
now

334
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,510
you can really use HF on a portable

335
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,669
radio because as as a frequency
decreases the antenna

336
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,909
size increases proportionally but

337
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:54,070
if you if you had a radio a outside with

338
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,149
with it with the title and an hour the
vertical antenna that was suitable to

339
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:58,650
the frequency that you're using

340
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,360
on buildings might not be as much a
problem because you can actually

341
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,690
have a take-off angle that there's those
buildings bouts of the atmosphere comes

342
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:06,929
down somewhere else

343
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:10,840
arm sometimes predictably some sometimes
unpredictably

344
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,120
so for instance iPad I've had
conversations with people

345
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:18,600
in in Germany and and and a Holland in
nine other places in

346
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,000
in Europe with only one or two what's I
transmitting power from

347
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,090
from a crappy antenna in my in my
backyard a.m.

348
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,330
it actually this is this is a this is a
radio that skip has

349
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,790
this is this is very common amongst the
work what people call

350
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,158
GRP hobbyists in in amateur radio GOP
stand for

351
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,560
low-power operation typically less than
five watch yourself and this is a radio

352
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,070
that was actually built in and then out
to its can't you know

353
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,040
your model that is

354
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,168
but its okay this is part this actually
as to take the rock me

355
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,590
so a rock mine is a very popular
transceiver

356
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,810
thats it kidded by I forget the

357
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:01,139
the k1s to feel sorry yeah so so he
produced all these

358
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,659
I'll these kids that are are very
popular and it is it's a crystal

359
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:05,490
controlled

360
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,720
ICW radio so that means that basically

361
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,820
limit using Morse code um but but the
band with that

362
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,710
that Morse code uses in relation to
other modulation schemes like AM and FM

363
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,200
I is is very low which really increases
the signal to noise ratio

364
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,990
and and allows you to use really tight
filtering Mon signals that are otherwise

365
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,230
incredibly weak so if you guys money
learn Morse code or use computers to

366
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,600
generate in the coded

367
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
are you can actually even extend the
range %uh even further

368
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,020
cell good to be licenses amor amateur
radio operator

369
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,240
United States no longer requires the C
dot CW

370
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,360
test but CW still a popular mode

371
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,330
for the very reasons just mention and
and by the way there is a

372
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,780
at levers on Jay Leno we might mention
this because there was a there's a

373
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,820
contest there's a contest on Jay Leno
between the

374
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,439
the world's fastest text messengers

375
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,679
and to ham radio operators to see who
could get a message across faster

376
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,010
arm with Morse code versus texting the

377
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:11,879
arm the more the you keeping them in
suspense the

378
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,190
the the SMS guys got completely smoked

379
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,880
completely smoke okay on which which
begs the question:

380
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,440
Tom dead that is Morse code a better way
to enter your text message on your cell

381
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,270
phone

382
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:30,320
van then going around and hunting and
packing for these keys

383
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,629
and so actually I just I just got yeah I
have to say i text in line two and a

384
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,679
half hours to get my iPhone

385
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,830
and there's actually a program that you
can input.text

386
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,240
using Morse code into your iPhone so

387
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,870
get outs I think it's an interesting you
know it's an interesting turn of events

388
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,290
you know rain for so in the key if

389
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,740
so there's no external case I need a
blue I'm sorry any Bluetooth

390
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,990
a more Skokie now so I

391
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,140
of so so it's a really efficient mode
and and

392
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,620
and really really really power efficient
relative to you to some the other night

393
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,290
because the trend when the transmitter a
is on its it's really

394
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,230
its transmitting at the full power that
the transfers capable up and when it's

395
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,540
not

396
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,690
its it's it's completely also it's a
very power efficient mode

397
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,000
you can you can really help the
community of art far distances

398
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,050
with with really really very i mean its
it's almost

399
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:25,580
its it's almost it defies logic to
believe that you can actually build

400
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,350
something

401
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,360
in a weekend that can communicate arm
you know

402
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,740
thousands and thousands of miles its
it's effectively magic

403
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,980
that you can run you can communicate
without any

404
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,220
infrastructure from one point the planet
is some were

405
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,380
on the opposite side planet using

406
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,169
did this a tiny battery on

407
00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:50,480
and engine just its increased really
magic the

408
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,100
adjustable a little battery power thing
if in your hand he communicate without

409
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,140
any infrastructure around the world

410
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,630
I'm so think about that it's and and the
reliability is being able to

411
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,330
use a network that doesn't rely on a
corporation ur

412
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,080
a government agency to maintain

413
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,740
so real quick I'm gonna go over a couple
the antennas they can expect to use some

414
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,570
%uh VHF

415
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,490
I each effort with the same Watz rain

416
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,429
so-so so this is so this is %uh the
radiation pattern but I plant and this

417
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:22,820
is looking at the axis of the title
antenna

418
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,939
so typically these are cut for half work
half a wavelength so

419
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,980
the lower frequency though that the
larger the intent is going to be

420
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,760
but but they're there they offer pretty
pretty predictable

421
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,899
I radiation patterns which allows you to
you tour not

422
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:39,130
to direct to set up the antenna so that
the radiation pattern

423
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,159
is directed toward where you want to
communicate on

424
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,050
if you go to the next one K if you add a
couple of morale

425
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,840
elements to a typical I plant in you you
end up with the directional antenna call

426
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,470
the i mean he's a really common

427
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,280
you see them on rooftops a for
perception of TV signals

428
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,600
I typically typically you can know out
signals

429
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,760
that are causing interference or or or
or undesired

430
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,210
and a and and really really concentrate
your get your energy with with a hiking

431
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,899
which gives you

432
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:14,169
more power to their to the intended
recipient then a type on normally would

433
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:17,050
with a net in like this store their
little bit bigger and bulkier expect

434
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,840
especially at the age of frequencies but

435
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,090
they really do help for a for for

436
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:25,928
getting the message where you want to go
in in conditions that aren't exactly

437
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:27,110
desirable

438
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,300
did right that the driven element is

439
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,230
is in the middle the directors in the
front and the reflectors in the back

440
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,120
that's ok so the directors a little bit
smaller than half wave and

441
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:40,100
and that reflectors ala bill archer in
there the mean other than just being

442
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,540
grounded together there

443
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:44,860
absolutely there's they're absolutely
not connected

444
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:48,530
you can just hang a wire their past
halcion that way

445
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,960
II built one in an attic that way where
it was just you have a director that's a

446
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,040
wire behind it

447
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,840
and and then you've got the driven
element and then a whole bunch of

448
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,168
Directors in front of it

449
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:00,600
down the peaks I'm an addict and that's
another aspect directed

450
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,720
typically see these things mounted on
rooftops and the really huge in

451
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,560
and and kinda bulky and you wouldn't
expect to be able to discreetly the up

452
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,560
deploy them anywhere but actually you
can you can make these antennas at 8:30

453
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,149
each magnet wire which is

454
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:17,010
you incredibly hard to see if if it's
just hanging out looking for

455
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,370
arm if you if you can if you can find a
couple the trees that are

456
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:23,320
better space the way you want it to you
can you can set up an antenna like this

457
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,820
really really stealthily

458
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,399
and a and and really nobody would know
I've had had 19 like this at my

459
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:29,300
apartment building

460
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,460
now the ad but up and then fed and and a
couple the typos

461
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:36,390
that nobody's ever seen because that
that the wire that an easy so thin and

462
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,020
and you can transmit with a hundred
watts into the measly

463
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,010
and I'm and literally communicator on
the world so

464
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,580
their talk about rubber ducky your
cutlery yet the head

465
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,210
you know when he's not talking about the
rubber ducks there should be a couple

466
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,100
more radiation patterns they can show
depending

467
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,350
ok arm we started talking about this a
while ago

468
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,240
thought experiment was practical you
serve radio

469
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,020
for activists an activist situations and
a

470
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,470
most a gatherings demonstrations

471
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,690
meet-ups mashups what everyone up

472
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:13,250
are probably gonna take advantage if
some other radios that

473
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,310
that bernie was suggesting

474
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,560
GMRS FRS or or ham radio or

475
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,200
CB or various things whatever whatever's
available to people

476
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,370
up when people gather the use what they
have in hand

477
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,300
but there's a couple things that that
even though with most to these talkie

478
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,120
radios

479
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,950
the common antenna is what we call a
rubber ducky

480
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,399
a see where they do that I am

481
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,619
but the practical matter that is that

482
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:47,119
rubber duckies a negative gain antenna
under most circumstances

483
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,850
so 5 Watson scrapers if I want some
really only getting our

484
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,879
a radiated power up 1.58

485
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:58,919
thanks to Red Bird for correcting my
math I

486
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,520
and the way see most people operating
with them

487
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,889
as they hang them on their Bell the user

488
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,889
well my body is it anyway

489
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:13,190
so I'm cutting down there 1.5a what's
that much further

490
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,850
and I'm trying to communicate keep a
group organized

491
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:21,510
to keep them out of trouble up that's
problematic the right way to use a radio

492
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,609
like this

493
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,158
to get the best use out of it is to do
this

494
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,290
get the radio higher get the radio away
from your body attenuation that such use

495
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,790
the mic for

496
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:35,000
up just a practical aspect

497
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,590
the other thing you can do with any

498
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:42,460
any and this this applies to any these
radios if you cut the right frequency

499
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,750
is due it's called the tiger tail

500
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:51,800
his wire I'm in alright on all romantic
this is a telephone hook-up work

501
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,530
I you just cut it to a quarter wave

502
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:03,950
and put it around the base section of
the ducky

503
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,970
here are the figures UD nine-point
five-inches'

504
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,290
for two meters 6.5 for 440

505
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,210
and that's going to prove the efficiency
the radio as well even though that's

506
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:18,580
loose a flexible

507
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,230
oh well yet secured some way to the
ground side

508
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,310
now know it's it's it's it's actually
connected to the ground site basically

509
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,418
a rubber duckies a monopole 1/2 diable

510
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,780
your you're adding the other half for
the antenna

511
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,080
yeah yeah he's jamming in between the
connector basic yeah

512
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,270
tightening it around the block

513
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:46,050
back so so typically these these it has
rely on your body to complete the other

514
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,399
half

515
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,169
the antenna and and and it doesn't it
doesn't usually work so well and

516
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,540
in practical situations when it's got
your bell

517
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,408
outside backwards so so that's that's
the ESM a connector on his radio and

518
00:28:57,409 --> 00:28:58,169
what he's doing is

519
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,869
is actually wrapping that wire around in
the tightening the antenna

520
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:06,050
you can also secured you have access to
the real you sir Ford

521
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:09,760
its secured to the ground side at the
end

522
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,710
yes to improve your efficiency that hope
it

523
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,250
do to improve the efficiency a little
bit you're going to extend the ability

524
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,290
if you're talking a gathering of people
in a public place you're talking

525
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,639
hundreds of yards improvement

526
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:26,669
for hundreds of yards may be important
up

527
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:32,010
the other option is if your radio summer
the FRS GMRS radios don't have

528
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:33,710
disconnected Lenten as you can make

529
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:37,820
disconnect cable a

530
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,080
and they make intends to do other things
to improve efficiency

531
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,439
this is basically a quarter wave at

532
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,510
440 now it's 58 SWE

533
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:55,609
you would walk around carrying yes but
if you had to extend year

534
00:29:55,609 --> 00:29:58,649
communication for whatever purpose

535
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:03,960
you can do that people also make J polls
are between lead and a piece a collapse

536
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,560
chrome up in a tree and have them in
locations around where their

537
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,720
their gathering is so replacement in 10
is another option

538
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,869
these are all things that are fun to try
to do up to go back also to work but

539
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:20,909
bernie was talking about about using FRS
GMRS various types of radios

540
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:24,250
my wife and i got into recreational
kayaking a couple years ago

541
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,710
and I go on these trips and some people
on the trip would have FRS someone have

542
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:28,859
GMRS

543
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:32,679
some someone have marine radio well the
older

544
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,240
yea soo party fifty the earlier serial
numbers

545
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,720
you can modify to do all those so I have
one radio that does the mall

546
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,379
%uh you're not supposed to do that with
marine radio

547
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,470
but this that doesn't stop people from
doing it now I just want to mention that

548
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,149
radius give has a sieve

549
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:52,560
by one other by the most hackable
two-way radios ever

550
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,600
ever designed buy it buy you a seal was
very popular in the hacker community

551
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,730
you can so find money Bates the RT 50 is
a

552
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,909
army RT 50 okay I have never ft 50 Rd

553
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:09,119
ft Drake ft 50 fucked tanker 50 and this
article the fax tangle 50 are

554
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:13,760
I do find one though be careful the
later serial number one's heart is

555
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,940
hackable

556
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,970
I'll there's a lot of information about
that on the web he actually

557
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,149
tour across they can also receive a very
wide range of frequencies back on analog

558
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,340
cellular we still active until

559
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,460
few months ago you could listen to him
you can listen to

560
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,240
cellular phone calls on these things is
a voice recorder this is audio recorder

561
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,270
built into it

562
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,550
on it's it's really amazing the radio
they don't make them anymore

563
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,020
unfortunately

564
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,379
not that listening to cell phones is
legal this

565
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:42,919
that would be ross also you know that
would be wrong

566
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:47,139
nobody up here has ever done that

567
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:51,060
today up

568
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,510
first

569
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:59,810
I love the other part I wanted to talk
about it practical communication

570
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,859
again going back to the idea of an
activist gathering

571
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:06,020
is make sure you understand the limits
of your

572
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,179
women in terms of power power
transmission

573
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,760
power consumption there's nothing worse
than gathering a bunch of people

574
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,780
together

575
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:16,869
for an important demonstration are
important activity

576
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,740
and just when things start to get a
little interesting have the battery

577
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,960
scrap on your radio

578
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,810
not a good thing so first thing know the
practical

579
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,230
power consumption of your radio back to
what we were saying earlier

580
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,379
you know it's not five artists 1.58 do
what you can to prove that

581
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:36,800
but then on the other hand know the
power consumption factor

582
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,550
your batteries whether it's nickel caddy
technical data hydride

583
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:43,830
cadmium alkaline whatever using

584
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,270
up find a radio where you quick

585
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,330
dirty battery replacements

586
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,100
keep if you're using rechargeable stuff
keeper charge

587
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:00,060
a lot of allotted units will sell

588
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:04,740
a battery pack that lets you

589
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,520
use a field expedient just adding
regular alkaline batteries

590
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:12,730
so if you're rechargeable circuits
failed you for the day

591
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,929
you find the local convenience store
just

592
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:19,820
pick up some batteries you can keep your
and unfortunately most models tend to

593
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,090
limit the AppleCare when using alkaline
cells because you can trust much current

594
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,740
from them

595
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,849
right but but at least golf bags yet
option

596
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:31,428
and just in just say no the try square
the the 900 megahertz

597
00:33:31,429 --> 00:33:35,580
its spread spectrum radio comes with
rechargeable batteries but then you can

598
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,300
pull that pack out

599
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,099
and put AA's actors on another extension
on these a

600
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,399
on these radios you get two for 80 bucks
on Amazon also they also to text

601
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,210
messaging

602
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:49,349
you can do fairly secure text messaging
on between radios maybe

603
00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:52,560
a mile or so away in store can't
messages in

604
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,690
it's the they're really worth checking
out that the only drawback to the text

605
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:59,460
messaging that I found out when my wife
and I used in ways that

606
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:02,790
it does not tell you that it got
delivered its just transmitting it in

607
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,470
the blind

608
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,129
unconnected so if the message doesn't go
through

609
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,849
the message didn't go through then you
have no way to know

610
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:14,359
that you get no acknowledgement fact
that it came thru which i think is a non

611
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,109
you know which is an area of improvement
for them

612
00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:21,230
but okay the one other thing is is

613
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,320
if you think about it most radios have

614
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,359
some ability to plug into wall wart
circuit or

615
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:33,060
were a car we used to call cigarette
lighter now we call utility

616
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,149
blog something whatever is

617
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:39,668
fine whatever whatever radios you're
using

618
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,759
find a way to get from 13.84 12 to 14
volts

619
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,879
to the revolt your radio needs some way

620
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,899
because you're all there's always a car
around you can always pop the hood

621
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,368
and just woke up not most amateur radio
equipment most amateur radio equipment

622
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:00,820
accepts global supply since it's
incredibly common cell

623
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,210
and even know other quick min that
doesn't use like uses batteries

624
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,930
this little voltage converters you can
get ever traveled down to

625
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:11,790
four-and-a-half 46 faults or whatever 3d
having to use

626
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:17,690
this over

627
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,040
modified this cable for

628
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,109
just the utility talk I'll

629
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:32,109
comment radio connectors for power are
something called power poles

630
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:37,190
and work the earlier before articles or
event it was something called

631
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,359
molex so I built this cable

632
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:43,840
so I I have the common standards all
inline

633
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,609
so if I run across another group of
people who were doing radio

634
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:51,500
and they have I have the ability to draw
power from them I can just pop up that

635
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,590
cable but like I said in the long run

636
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:58,160
in a real emergency just being able to
to tap a car battery is a great way to

637
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,149
go

638
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,770
and it's all about just you know keeping
your communication lines open and

639
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,000
working throughout the

640
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,119
the extended here gather what about it
what about solar power

641
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,730
shit this is my absolute favorite now
edge of this to me

642
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,859
like a year ago or something its see I
think this

643
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,090
with a bomb escape was saying at

644
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:25,410
being able to don't want this to stop
this this panel was off the grid

645
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,180
really communications netted me that
that means not only are you off

646
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,720
the agree to the communications
infrastructure that relies on corporate

647
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,670
government

648
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,180
on networks missus

649
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:42,819
completely wireless using no other

650
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,150
infrastructure on there's the power
infrastructure to that we all are

651
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,190
reliant on

652
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,550
but you can use batteries and in
rechargeable batteries

653
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,040
and so development for the vote
photovoltaic

654
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,180
handles or solar solar panels like this
this happens be a military surplus

655
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,140
unit which is a really nice for stuff
like a notebook generate about 15 wants

656
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,950
a power

657
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,530
I'm that would that would easily charge
batteries for any these devices which

658
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:08,750
shown you today

659
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:12,200
on so if you really wanna be off the
grid you can be

660
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,160
free if any infrastructure between you
and the party you're communicating with

661
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,649
in free if any infrastructures first
paragraph

662
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,880
so off the grid communications is really
possible

663
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,810
now did that the actual output power the
radio is significantly less in the input

664
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,450
power that you supply to itself

665
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,800
for instance if this is a fifteen why
account you may only get a couple what

666
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,730
are the radio

667
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,170
but when using shortwave bands or or
linus a VHF UHF communications that's

668
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,970
that's almost enough you almost don't
even need a better battery in a lotta

669
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:40,680
cases

670
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,899
so if you only have solar panel
last-ditch kind of need to get the

671
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,760
message out its

672
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,300
it works

673
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,340
square than me

674
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,609
alright so so we talked about some stuff
where

675
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:02,140
your you're completely off the grid okay
you're not relying on anybody else to do

676
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,509
anything now

677
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,040
of course you could build your own greed
sort of right

678
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,160
okay so you're your you're gonna
connecting you wanna have long-distance

679
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,069
communications between

680
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,750
to different locations let's just say so

681
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,380
or you wanna have a you want to put your
own repeater up

682
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,119
um in the ham band maybe not in the
ambient

683
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,410
okay so d-star

684
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,580
is a is a new mode is a new is a
modulation technique

685
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,710
that was developed by

686
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,780
the Japanese immature radio

687
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,980
I actually real a week arm in a they own
the standard

688
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,030
although the the one of the problems
with it is that only one manufactures

689
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,280
making the radios right now

690
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,480
so the prices maintaining itself

691
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,130
not really a at a good level to put a
whole stack

692
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,320
all three bands with a high speed data
side

693
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,960
is about fourteen or fifteen thousand
dollars just for the radios

694
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,630
which is very expensive it's not because
its proprietary

695
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,060
because I it's not you it's not because
its proprietary it's just

696
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,560
its the price is not come down its brand
new technology it's it's you know it's

697
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,290
only

698
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,450
it's only really now starting to get
more widespread utilization

699
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,990
I mean there's only a couple of these in
New York City at all

700
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,310
and there's I believe there's only one
it's for to you

701
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,410
a gateway that can put it out on the
internet will talk about that a second

702
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,680
a handheld radio is less than about
three hundred and seventy-five dollars

703
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,810
depending

704
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:37,580
a new in

705
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:44,580
so this is war this is one of those
radios

706
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,530
you know this just camera thing really
mess you up at your list except

707
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,780
um so said purple so um

708
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:00,310
here's why these radios and in I want to
get too much and the star but it gives

709
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,740
you the capability

710
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,610
going through the internet or backbone
that you create

711
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:09,230
using wifi they even have a 10 gigahertz

712
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,670
tambien link that you can link it 10
megabits between sites

713
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,480
arm and you can talk digital voice

714
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,910
arm between two people without a
repeater

715
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:25,589
between a repeater covering a large area
or

716
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,630
repeater to rip your linking or repeater
to you

717
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,220
reflector which is like multiple
repeaters connected together

718
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:36,550
covering a large area now you like I
said you can connect that to a gateway

719
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,070
that can connect to the internet

720
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,450
you can just dial up a

721
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:45,500
arm are repeater in a faraway place

722
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,980
your dialed up to your local repeater
you change the settings

723
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,350
and you're popping out in London on a
frequency

724
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,130
your in New York your top popping out on
a frequency in London just

725
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:59,440
like that and it's very appliance

726
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,540
operator oriented not experimentation

727
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:05,940
arm some other

728
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,650
projects some other things that are out
there for digital communications as

729
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,930
project 25 p25

730
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,750
on that was created by the association
of public-safety communications

731
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,160
officials

732
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,390
the intent here is to use this

733
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,240
for police departments in public safety
fire departments

734
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:32,270
to communicate with each other but this
stuff is just starting to hit the

735
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,060
surplus market a little bit

736
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:38,110
arm but it's still very very expensive

737
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,730
used hand-held will run you over five
hundred dollars

738
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:45,170
but it does have the ability to have
encryption

739
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,080
in it and turned on you're not allowed
to do that in the Champions

740
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,120
but if you were to program it on Myer's
then there's

741
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,920
absolutely nothing says you cannot use I
think Rick full-on

742
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,220
p25 encryption on Myer's and

743
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,600
mean that's bill to the level that
police

744
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:09,610
are using it so you're using basically
the same technology is the police

745
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,970
now the fact that they're going to p25

746
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,510
which is a digital mode you know
everybody oh we gotta go digital we

747
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:18,420
gotta go digital everything's gonna be
digital

748
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,150
um interestingly enough I believe the
New York City Police Department

749
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:25,170
is staying analog on UHF

750
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:29,370
because it works better it's much easier
to monitor to

751
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:32,589
yeah with I correct like a police
scanner there are there better their

752
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,560
police scanner their

753
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,980
like scanners like like this one here
but they generally cost between three

754
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,180
five hundred dollars

755
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,000
that will allow you to listen to on in
cryptid digital

756
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,080
ap ko 25 transmissions and

757
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,610
an army in phnom you know the TSA

758
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,640
the TSA uses after 25 radio simplex

759
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,730
and they all bought and paid the money

760
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,730
for them all to be in cryptid man takes
too much effort to put the encryption

761
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:00,410
keys in them

762
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,700
so they're all wide open

763
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,660
I mean I've never really I've never
listen to my never bothered as a No

764
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,100
really

765
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,290
it's not that interesting but they the
you know they're using a mate your

766
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:15,300
government dollars paid several thousand
dollars for each of these radios to have

767
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:20,040
a encryption and we have yet I've yet to
ever hear anybody is actually using the

768
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,690
key loaders

769
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,140
what i was gonna say is because
allottees police departments

770
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,540
are buying project 25 radios an
interesting development

771
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,660
is that these non

772
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,100
digital radios that work really well

773
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,620
like the Motorola saber with

774
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,180
encryption modules are coming onto the
used market

775
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,930
and the what used to be the problem was
the key loaders

776
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:49,140
you could not find the key workers they
were a hundred dollars

777
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,140
six hundred dollars now they're 150
dollars

778
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,759
because they're just flooding out on you
may have to make the cable and you may

779
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,000
have to do a lot of stuff in a lottery

780
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,250
if you want to get into that stuff go to
bat lab stock com

781
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,850
they're great okay bat lab stock com
they will tell you everything you need

782
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,970
to know about Motorola radios

783
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,260
don't back baat

784
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,570
laps got don't be afraid about the high
prices

785
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,030
love the new technologies that are
coming into radio because

786
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,800
they all come down and they all get the
surplus market at some point

787
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,870
most diverse it began with to me to
repeaters in the

788
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:29,220
in the sixties and seventies it all
started with up

789
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,230
surplus Motorola a taxicab radios

790
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,860
as they came on the market people they
they showed up a hamfest for

791
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:40,250
a couple dollars people change them and
made radios out to them

792
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:43,090
there's plenty plenty of opportunities
and then there's no reason to believe

793
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:45,640
this is going to occur with some of
these new technologies

794
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:50,290
in a fairly rapid fashion why because
the commercial entities and Motorola's

795
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:51,900
and and companies like that

796
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,570
they want to keep sellin the government
agencies new gear

797
00:44:56,570 --> 00:45:00,830
so the old stuff it's the surplus market
and we get the benefit from it

798
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:04,060
um really quickly that this is part of
the star

799
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:07,680
the the riff the gateway uses a

800
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,529
basically a Linux box running 70 s in
the

801
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,750
the yom the the special software

802
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,990
and there's also a a DVD dong all that's

803
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,860
it's just been both recently released to
the day invention

804
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,350
and that allows you to play D Star and
you don't even have to have a radio

805
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:32,029
now you have to have a call sign and
they make sure you are who you say you r

806
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:35,090
arm but other than that I mean in is the
same thing with

807
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,870
some other modes like echolink I'm just
gonna drop some names here

808
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:42,450
ir LP arm those are all

809
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:45,780
ways to link whether they're analog or
digital

810
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,160
all these places together over a TCP IP
connection whether that be the Internet

811
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,750
or private network or whatever because
that's not off the grid communications

812
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,080
but it is pretty cool

813
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,240
yeah so not not really exactly off the
grid at least you're making

814
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,210
again unless you're making the grade
yourself you know you could type 2

815
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,710
places together that are far apart with
the 2.4 day going

816
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,510
that you put in yourself um here's

817
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:15,380
just to give you an idea this is the the
d-star network as it stands right now

818
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,740
on believe it or not Alabama has put in
a massive system

819
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,320
that's been partially funded by the
state Cape May New Jersey is a full

820
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,510
system now

821
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,440
yeah it yet to me I don't know how
up-to-date a line 97

822
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,270
and and there's that there's one that
just one on the Empire State Building

823
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,140
a UHF one in a Georgia where I'm from is

824
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:39,680
is also working with Georgia Public
Broadcasting and they're gonna have a

825
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,450
system on every GP TV tower

826
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:47,340
in this state and and that's going to be
linked together with GP TV's

827
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,230
private backbone over fiber

828
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,950
now coarser dealing with the state so if
you wanna

829
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:58,250
use this for protest I can pretty much
guarantee they be listening

830
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:02,370
arm but its it there's an interesting
technologies out there

831
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:05,839
and Dom and whether they be

832
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:11,130
some digital voice you can also use the
d-star radios

833
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:16,770
to do from its what you guys would
consider very slow speed data

834
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:18,509
transmission 1200 baud

835
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,550
or 9600 baud arm or are the fastest one
is a 128

836
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,650
K and they call at the 120 K they called
me

837
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:30,240
high speed data channel okay so

838
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,230
it's all relative okay but those are
some other technologies that are out

839
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:37,790
there if you have specific questions
here you can hear this

840
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:42,050
come come CS still had a slim CS
questions now radio station we had you

841
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,920
have questions ask some now

842
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,390
we're queer discoveries come up to the
mic them there's gonna be an amateur

843
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,359
radios

844
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,400
station setup we get NFC special SEC

845
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:55,370
special event FCC call sign for the
conference call W to each

846
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,660
analyze the station will be setup
outside the conference

847
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:02,540
and Scythia the ballroom here probably
in an hour cell

848
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:06,180
will answer more questions up there for
all day in in weather

849
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:09,330
whether you're a hammer not I encourage
you to go

850
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:14,700
to Google for hamfest and whatever your
local town is

851
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,130
and there's always some i mean they're
gonna be small they're gonna be big

852
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,730
depending on where you are

853
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,960
arm but they're really great there's a
lot of used

854
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,730
aqui elektronik year that's in and
computer equipment that's not just ham

855
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:28,630
radio stuff but if you go to

856
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:32,440
Dayton the dating him the engine
invention doubt or

857
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,280
that is the big one in the United States
if you are from

858
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:41,000
Europe the big one in in Europe is Free
Church of them

859
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,760
and they're both great experiences if
you if you get to go over there

860
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,700
Friedrichshafen Germany is is right
across the lake from a Switzerland its

861
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,650
you can find is a reckoning take the
train have that done at one time wish I

862
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,140
could go every year but it's great

863
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,890
you're there the world there's to the
venture the largest gatherings have

864
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:58,049
communications keeps

865
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,090
in the world is really fascinating and
he can buy a lot a surplus equipment

866
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:01,730
there for

867
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,730
Turchi and that's where I'm at Ed he
walked up to the booth had never seen

868
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:06,900
before I heard is

869
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,570
had heard a moan off the hook and
recognize his voice

870
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,410
I it will take questions okay

871
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,569
I have been wondering how specifically
the

872
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,580
type of material their radio waves have
to go through

873
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:26,590
affects it I assume that metal is bad
because I create a Faraday cage

874
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,740
that for example I know that a lot of
people stand near the window to use

875
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,190
their cell phone

876
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:36,120
is that actually a good thing to do
rated typically as

877
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:41,060
as the frequency increases and and and

878
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,270
okay typically as the frequency
increases the the absorption increases

879
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:48,030
as well so as as you get higher in
frequency in the in the VHF UHF antenna

880
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:51,590
microwave frequencies bill you'll tend
to find very high absorption most common

881
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,710
material self

882
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,250
so cell phones are kind of probably
close to the upper limit love

883
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,410
above where we where we're going to be
able to be with the

884
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:03,680
without having to be outside in and
being line of sight to the Transit 2.4

885
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:07,200
gigahertz works pretty well and and and
much about that the up to absorption

886
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,070
starts to get free high

887
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,690
so to be question we have a lot of
people that ask they're here with

888
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:13,460
questions

889
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,860
only about two minutes left so where to
take your questions outside XD have a

890
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,120
couple things a giveaway

891
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,020
so sorry you're in line here but on just
not enough time to get all these

892
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,040
questions being asked an outside a few
minutes

893
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,470
Abhisit there's a couple the magazine's
couple three magazines out

894
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:30,530
that address the topics for talking
about on for both amateur radio and

895
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,820
non-licensed medications the latter
there's two magazines once called

896
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,200
monitoring times

897
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,680
it's worth checking out it is popular
communications here they have a good

898
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,770
writer

899
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:44,590
and popular communication said gave us
three gifts inscriptions

900
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:47,790
so we're gonna have to give no way
somehow we so so

901
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:52,320
so I guess what we thought about was
anyway tell me what that saying

902
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:56,780
yes with what is its what does it say

903
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,470
hope it says hope alright he have you
get one

904
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:07,680
congratulations thank you

905
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,890
we had to do one really all you know
kind of an old school way to

906
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:14,960
yet we are on the right now talent right
