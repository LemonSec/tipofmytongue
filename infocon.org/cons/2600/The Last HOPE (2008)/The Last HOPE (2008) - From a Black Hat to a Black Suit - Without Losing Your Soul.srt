20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,270

00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,080
I've for the almost it's not happening
the course of world you have to give

25
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,760
those up

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,520
I I was counter-culture at one point I
am

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,908
gonna tell you the story later on how
you can

28
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:38,680
end up losing a little bit if you're not
too careful and now I

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,200
commute even more

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,280
sad it gets worse

31
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,280
and you know you love it and a

32
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:57,420
seriously you would be really surprised

33
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,430
you kinda forget the good parts

34
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,939
of being on one side and being on the
other side

35
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:07,490
I will now answer all references to you
mister Anderson

36
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,959
and the plague thank you

37
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,510
I'm it's really easy

38
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,739
to keep yourself I would've an executive
position I'll give you head

39
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,389
dressing the way most of us dress and
wearing our hair the way most of us do

40
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,029
you're never going to get the seat at at
the big table

41
00:02:27,029 --> 00:02:30,249
sorry I'm it so

42
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:33,469
it's actually really easy to get into
the club I'm

43
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:36,469
especially this one now

44
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:40,888
here's the funny story right CISO that
this is the job or your intention

45
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:44,489
is to put yourself out of a job
thoroughness

46
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:48,069
in the in the real world we should have
information security separate from just

47
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:49,219
information management

48
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,989
but there's no CIO's are actually doing
their job out there in the real world so

49
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:54,279
we had to step in and do it

50
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:59,499
this is a lot about the hacking at a lot
about the what you do about the hacking

51
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:03,260
it's a lot more about how you do the
right things with information

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,879
what you want I mean

53
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,909
really if if you're like me you want

54
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,888
leisure time I you want to have a good
job

55
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:17,540
you want stable work and

56
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,120
do there's also some downsides

57
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,389
you really don't want to be on Paul

58
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,079
anymore of deep do you

59
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,230
wanna be really looking at the downside
of

60
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,559
where the back stops especially after

61
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:39,139
it's on the front page the newspaper I'm

62
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:42,579
you how other people do things that
affect your livelihood

63
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:46,279
hair you know what happens to see ISO's

64
00:03:46,279 --> 00:03:51,339
companies who end up on the front page
of the paper we call them waiters

65
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:56,279
yeah I'm how you answer this

66
00:03:56,279 --> 00:04:00,879
is really whether or not you can be able
to get a keeper jobs and corporate

67
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,029
information security

68
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:05,129
to do we need to define corporate
information security

69
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:08,829
that's the person who follows the SAMS
roles and says no

70
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:13,019
nodding and smiling you guys actually
working with companies don't you

71
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,680
crawl I'm mmm

72
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,410
you it's really a lot of fun I swear

73
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,710
I'm one-time

74
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,210
I kid you not is actually something the
room knows this is true

75
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,859
I spent a week refreshing Slashdot five
days

76
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,650
seven-and-a-half hours a day because my
boss managed by butts in seats

77
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,300
I hit at five and Slashdot for week

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,680
I'm a course there's other times where
I've been told to go home after I

79
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,290
finished working 100 hours

80
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,970
Monday to Friday so

81
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,770
it gets really between two worlds I'd
like to point this out

82
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,159
as being sorta really Kia really
important

83
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,640
I you're going to be updating
documentation

84
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,740
love I can hear the pin drop

85
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,490
you're gonna be hunting for Lost Tapes
because you're lost tapes: turning to

86
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:12,870
him

87
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,660
front page news right you're gonna be
cleaning up after other people

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,210
most people in most companies are very
well-intentioned they're trying to do

89
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,590
the right thing for everyone

90
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,840
and they're often completely freaking
wrong

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,110
and you're gonna have to clean up the
mess that they leave behind a fictitious

92
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,050
the Edna

93
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,780
she's had every job in the company she
knows everything had no just landed us

94
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,700
on the front page of the newspaper
because she thought she was being nice

95
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,860
when she offered customer list

96
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,650
to a former employee there you go

97
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,910
and and nobody's going to care about you

98
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm do you have what it takes you know
are you prepared to go all the way to

99
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,930
the top

100
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,950
this is one of those jobs trajectories
thats

101
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:01,110
more ballistic when guided once you
launch on this path you have to be

102
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,920
prepared actually end up there

103
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,180
you know when I started doing firewall
work back back in the olden days

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,840
in in the nineties you guys remember the
93

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,580
and firewall for new shiny think he
likes it was great

106
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,330
I'm I I did not expect that I was going
to end up

107
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,460
as CISO by publicly traded company

108
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,109
that was not actually my intention I
just wanted a nice job record set in a

109
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,660
corner play with blinking lights and
shiny things

110
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,250
and they don't let me do that anymore

111
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,780
yeah but most importantly the word

112
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,870
everybody knows the word everybody has
their own version of the word

113
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,650
I have a very very small batch process
that runs nightly

114
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,490
takes care this for me

115
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,349
I'm in let's let's talk about getting

116
00:06:49,349 --> 00:06:53,539
the first girl yes I'm reading

117
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:58,020
of two screens and paper same time this
is not

118
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,150
the job where you do security stuff for
25 percent your time

119
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,729
sys admin work for 25 percent your time
and run cable and fix printers

120
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:10,289
for the other 50 percent of the time
this is the first job where it's a full

121
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:11,469
time gig

122
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:14,590
and it's hard to get back first
full-time gig

123
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,560
because what are you messing right
experience

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,840
and you know I'm sitting there doing a
resume and it says well

125
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,879
I work in the change management group at
the IT department

126
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,530
XYZ company and I want to be. an InfoSec

127
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,900
guy or girl would love to have more
girls

128
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,650
yeah first there's there's no purpose

129
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,250
sporty these girls it this is a career
arc you can be on

130
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,770
in you've got to get your credit to
gather

131
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,430
you know you gotta have the resume I
you're probably blogging

132
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,349
or twittering or web 2.0 and you're on
the facespace

133
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:56,110
right and and you got Google results

134
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,509
or as we heard to talks ago evil Google
you have Yahoo results

135
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,089
qusai for Yahoo I'm but you also have
actual skill

136
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:08,849
because when you're sitting in that
first interview

137
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,430
and get past the HR people it's all
about

138
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:17,330
the keyword management and

139
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,740
not lying yes

140
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,400
the lying counts we catch that in the
second interview where we checked on

141
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,169
your skills

142
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,669
in order to get there you're gonna have
to pay a lot abuse you're gonna have to

143
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:29,258
work those

144
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:33,550
part security jobs you know where your
slowly ratcheting it up from twenty-five

145
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:36,939
226 227 percent I'm

146
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,039
you're gonna have to put in the time and
a lot about time

147
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:43,689
is going to show up in the time he spent
outside of work

148
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,790
um yeah and it's gonna be boring

149
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,790
during your time doing that for summer
jobs expect that you will be more

150
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,240
doing mostly things like review and
metrics

151
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,110
and review and metrics is really boring
stuff but it's what I need to make

152
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,040
decisions so if your crappy job I make
rapid decisions

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,599
and we'll get fired it counts

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,390
and you're gonna have to do with the
SANS way if you're not reading the

you can about

167
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,890
the infrastructure because you probably
come from a background where you played

168
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,339
with

169
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:56,250
this much what's really used in the real
world you know

170
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,310
at home you don't have a lot of
experience to Fibre Channel sounds

171
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,560
unless you have electricity included
with your rent

172
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,329
I'm you want to get on project teams
you're gonna wanna ask a lot of

173
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:09,279
questions

174
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,949
I you're going to you be working your
way

175
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:19,020
two words being the generalist the sad
part a corporate security is that you

176
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,199
have to have a fully functional bullshit
meter

177
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:26,300
for every person you work with I have to
know as much about Windows security UNIX

178
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,170
security

179
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,899
as/400 security mainframe security
network security firewall security

180
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,579
a fancy new blinky lights device that
they just created a market vertical for

181
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:39,760
oh I'm sorry GOP security I'm

182
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,709
you have to be that journalists because
everybody's going to be trying to snow

183
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,160
you

184
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,350
and you've got to know this stuff hand
you're gonna not end up staying anywhere

185
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,110
for very long

186
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,750
that's also the side horrible truth I'm

187
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,180
you gotta stay at least a year ago if
you start seeing short periods

188
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,220
I spent seven days working there that's
not good

189
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,980
I'm be I got my first paycheck after my
first day which was also my last day

190
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,250
is not good I anything less than a year
sticks out on a resume

191
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,339
probably won't get you past the HR
filters are

192
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:17,309
but you're gonna be trying on different
kinds organizations to see how they fit

193
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:18,559
and how they feel

194
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,819
and where you're going to land I'm
you've got to work for really big

195
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,579
companies

196
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:26,319
think 30,000 50,000 employees or more
where you are

197
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,870
literally just a number you gotta work
for small companies

198
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,610
like five or six people where you're
just a number and also the janitor

199
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm and and the it would he would be
really good to spend some time out there

200
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,279
working

201
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,189
in the public sector I'm there's things
that can be learned from them

202
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:47,650
visually two or three things that can be
learned from them but there are things

203
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,779
that can be learned from them

204
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,400
I you need most of all the ability to
say yeah I've been there

205
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,309
and I've done that and you're not going
to get that any other way than

206
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:00,939
having be merry doing back

207
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:04,400
sorry was this not the obvious part no

208
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,660
pin drop you need to work are your top
non technical skills

209
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:14,939
I this is what we used to refer to in
the olden days a social engineering

210
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:20,189
are wide-scale I'm I cannot emphasize
enough the likability

211
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,839
aspect you are going to have to get
along with others

212
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,529
this is when you get to start building
close of skills that you ignored for

213
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,069
your entire life

214
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:36,920
so lemme you moving up the chain sure
team leader now

215
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:43,449
I this means that you have fuzzy little
heads that look to you for guidance

216
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:46,630
they want to be your friend and they
want to survive there

217
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:51,180
trip through step 1: now since you've
been there you need to help them

218
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,600
you need to protect them from the
company that you are all working for

219
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,970
to allow them to build and the same time
you need to

220
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:02,500
not lose your skills and grad because
you're not done your meteoric rise to

221
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,670
Kingdom yet Queen girls

222
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,779
lease Corp sec to me to be there

223
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,959
I know it sounds like it's a joke but
it's not because

224
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,160
you know in in 15 years of this I can
count

225
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,890
on less than one hand the number girls
that I've worked with in corporate

226
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,079
security

227
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,319
and the number idiots I've worked with
to have hands

228
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:30,229
way radio sequels mostly boys

229
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,339
remember the hardest part in this is
gonna be attack

230
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:38,529
and doing all of those nice personal
things like holidays sick days

231
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,110
performance reviews 360 reviews

232
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,949
this is also Nick million people working
a corporation that has more than seven

233
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,350
employees

234
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:49,910
I'm you're keeping up with the crap

235
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,029
this is the part where you begin to
learn the real truth which is that in

236
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:55,819
for a sec has very little to do with
technology

237
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,929
and everything to do with people it's
not

238
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:02,839
delights it's not shiny things it's not
product verticals

239
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,689
it's not whatever that sales guys trying
to sell you

240
00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:09,990
but are you really ready for that

241
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,020
is a crisis of faith for me to give up
playing with computers

242
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,970
I'm but you know what hacking people is
way more fun

243
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,480
think about it I get a whole corporation
to play with

244
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,910
to steer Jost very nice

245
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,490
of course you have to do it for some
their roles and

246
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,050
and with mostly their people they're not
deter people were great

247
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,710
no would come to this country

248
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,810
you also going to have to know finance
if you don't know finance

249
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,710
if you have a credit card balance that
is more than

250
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:53,210
your annual income now's a good time to
start

251
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,260
sorting out what finance means and
you're going to have to get all

252
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,260
I'm

253
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,290
this is the part where you're building
that reputation

254
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,420
because you know in so much as

255
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,820
people like Charles Stross and Corey
doctor like to talk about the reputation

256
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,100
economy

257
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,050
and how this is the greatest new things
as what web 7.0 is going to look like

258
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:29,050
the reality is arm were already there
people know

259
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,370
who you know and what you know and word
spreads

260
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,460
whenever you screw up you can bet

261
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,650
that 25 people know about it before the
end of the day and when you do something

262
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,480
really good

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,640
you have a hard time finding one person
who hears about it

264
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,260
so to a greater or lesser extent

265
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,260
your gonna have to take care of it on
your own

266
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,910
this is where in life building seminar
as you hear the word

267
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,490
networking again

268
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,040
the pink attack what you doing good

269
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,209
right you've you've done the team leader
thing for a while you can you maybe even

270
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,220
start around for a couple

271
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,900
organizations this stuff is starting to
make more sense to you

272
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,090
I and now all of a sudden you have to
talk to people

273
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,250
I'm

274
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:20,430
let's talk about printer defense let's

275
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:27,430
not use any IT language at all the word
firewall becomes a swear word

276
00:16:36,249 --> 00:16:37,749
charge to review my notes here

277
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:43,569
how do you speak the language of the
executives

278
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,479
all you need to articulate risk

279
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:51,479
these are people are very good at
managing risks within their own domains

280
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:55,429
they have no idea what your domain is
even though it's the key component to

281
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:56,209
their business

282
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,539
have had a sans teachers articulate
risks

283
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,279
everyone pipe up with our sock

284
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,529
yeah

285
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,579
I was forced to make you guys live what
is this

286
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,148
okay alright legal risk

287
00:17:15,149 --> 00:17:19,850
regulatory risk reputational risk these
are also known as

288
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,089
orange jumpsuit lose your house look
stupid

289
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,158
help them understand that

290
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:29,269
if you don't have a legal this period
for risk reputational risk

291
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:32,370
they have fallen asleep before you got
reputational

292
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,690
talk to about orange jumpsuits losing
their houses

293
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,820
and looking stupid they'll start to
resume

294
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,529
really really easily of course you hear
from them

295
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:49,600
none of the above and you're gonna have
to listen to what they mean when they

296
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,360
say

297
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,940
none of the above because the reality is
they do things that make themselves look

298
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,500
stupid

299
00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:00,080
every single day Michael him

300
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,539
you need to bridge or experience to
their experience

301
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,809
so you have valuable experiences from
having climbed up from the bottom

302
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,710
they have valuable experiences from
having been born with a spoon in their

303
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,149
mouth

304
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:16,309
bridge those two experiences together
into a cold

305
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:20,840
he said for mostly help them understand
that you're there

306
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,730
to talk to them about the risks that you
experience

307
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,970
based on their behavior am

308
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,159
things right there based on their
behavior less and waving that's your job

309
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:36,460
and they're going to really thank you
for at some point

310
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,779
the downside

311
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:44,409
you you read some books about finance
announced time start taking some

312
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:48,330
some B school courses we know that on
your way through school you took the

313
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,928
kinda sideways road I took which
included media arts which

314
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:56,720
let me tell you doesn't pay well I you
don't have the school background

315
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,740
it's time to generate one start taking
courses

316
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,399
go to community schools to all the right
things

317
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:09,809
I'm please don't play golf sad truth

318
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:13,110
but don't tell me what I don't want to
hear

319
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,769
arm you can wear the shirt on the inside

320
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,789
though often the day is forever and I'm

321
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:23,200
under the suit important I'm

322
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,460
this is the the classic you heard this
from your career counselors as far back

323
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,559
probably as early high school dress for
the job you want

324
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,649
not for job you have your

325
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:38,700
a alright underwear fetish talk

326
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,090
in the fourth when their how

327
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:45,649
just put on DMC really are

328
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,730
keep the jacket in the closet works you
have to wear an all-time furs

329
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:55,730
so probably you don't have 100 percent
will soon at this point hey terrifying

330
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,980
true I'm this is another one of those
times where

331
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,629
I just look at the demographics of the
room girls could really help out

332
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:12,809
I they do know how to dress you well ask
for help

333
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:18,529
I'm sure you all know withdrawal for 4.1
up

334
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:25,389
of I'm

335
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:30,250
note that your undercover up because
you're still a geek in your store hacker

336
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,730
hang and very don't need to know that

337
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,059
all secret

338
00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,158
in

339
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,019
I should I give some credit

340
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:48,269
I may or may not have seen johnnie long
its

341
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:52,129
est presque go see john wants and

342
00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm maintain your soul

343
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,720
this is gonna be the hard part because
you're in courts act now I mean

344
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,909
you work in a glass building you
probably commute you probably read the

345
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:04,659
newspaper

346
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,720
on on purpose in the bathroom I'm

347
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,809
hmm feedback in a hacker and

348
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,059
and realize that when you left actually
start making money um

349
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:19,149
going to play with these things becomes
not only fun but cheap

350
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:23,240
highly recommended that you get from
France's

351
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,240
especially somebody else's point paying
for them

352
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,350
and do the fun stuff you burned at this
point

353
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,220
except

354
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:45,019
must except can go back to this perk

355
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:48,269
you guys know what passive-aggressive
behavior

356
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:54,250
yes mom

357
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,720
she's going proximity twice as fast as
it wanted to i'm talking really really

358
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,510
fast

359
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,480
no aka 136 linesman free people

360
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,049
yeah also have passive aggression

361
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,760
coming up there I'm they will

362
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,860
treat you like crack II sort of get used
to that

363
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,320
I'm you will be the bar most of the
jokes and you'll be the body matrix

364
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,428
management

365
00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:26,649
real matrix management as I have four
bosses

366
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,850
I'd love to be kidding you I have for
bosses

367
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,960
each one of them things that they have a
whole I'm 100 percent of my time

368
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,700
they're all

369
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,889
I'm you you really need to be paying
attention as part of you

370
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:46,350
star wanting to be like them

371
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:53,350
and that's okay

372
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,590
maintain your contacts

373
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,149
now this is this is the the hard part
practices the

374
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,180
once you've been an organization and you
spent some time working there

375
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,440
and you've moved up and moved out move
onward

376
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,530
you need to remember that you're going
to encounter those people again

377
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,250
I'm most if you're from cities I presume
so hot oven for a sec going on in

378
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,310
country over should be um

379
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:22,649
you know how the industry is a really
small

380
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,770
you know everybody who's doing in for a
sec in your city picture from the city I

381
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,129
am from you know where

382
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,100
everybody's doing four seconds very
incestuous I'm

383
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,580
you're gonna keep running into the same
people over and over again that sales

384
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,129
guy named Bob from vendor a

385
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,270
he's gonna be a vendor be next year and
circles going around

386
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,270
you may end up working for someone who
used to work for you

387
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,980
everyone's on a different trajectory
there's maybe a little sharper than

388
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,630
yours

389
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,870
I'm mostly don't be forgettable

390
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:59,130
personal you're gonna remember me after
today that's alright

391
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,460
avoid jerk

392
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,020
which is really hard for pretty much
every in for a sec

393
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:13,020
guy I know yeah

394
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,559
everybody know but professional
organizations for this kinda stuff

395
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:24,490
to sans group you're not a CISSP gripped

396
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,490
I'm the professional organizations offer
you a lot of those networking linkages

397
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,029
love those places where you can loop
back around I'm

398
00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,399
be careful though sometimes I'm they
will bite you

399
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:41,929
by Iran how so

400
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:46,250
I'm sometimes they end up being tarred
with the brush

401
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,549
that you don't necessarily want to be
tired with there's

402
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:54,740
the reason why were my not a CISSP batch
because in the particular protocol that

403
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,330
I mean

404
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:58,428
in the particular geographic area that I
mean

405
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,210
the government is retraining people
who've lost

406
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,559
jobs as CISSP is same thing they did
with MCSE is about ten years ago

407
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,789
they're not doing well CISSP is I'm

408
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't know exactly why this is OK
without

409
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,720
I see two but it's happening and we're
getting a lot of paper

410
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,669
CISSP is through the door so that's just
one particular example form

411
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:26,149
one particular geographic location by
when you get the resume

412
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:29,559
and person doesn't have the crowd to be
able to answer the simple questions

413
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:32,700
has a far more precise rules

414
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,779
and you don't get an answer

415
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:39,010
they've had a you stop somebody really
doesn't want to talk about

416
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,360
that's my without

417
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,179
really dunning anyone too hard be
careful professional organizations

418
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,760
some a great summer so great good answer

419
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,330
kinda seeing I'm

420
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,449
this is the part where you get into the
mentoring role you should have been

421
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,039
there kind of all along but

422
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,399
now you're gonna be in charge of a
fairly large group of people

423
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:09,970
hopefully crawl back it's tough one I
you're at least know what some

424
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,960
am even though you're busy

425
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,000
take the time to mentor them there
should be a few who you know

426
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,669
who give you for him some clues about
what's going on at the bottom

427
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,350
which are hints and clues you need to
understand what's going on because

428
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:32,309
you finally made it to the top you
probably ready at this point you know

429
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,830
you you've done the work you've got a
business credentials you've moved on

430
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:42,830
its time star hang out c-suite the
Chiefs you've got a reputation

431
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,770
radocy somebody says hey I

432
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,690
really like to get together and do this
cool kinda project we need some

433
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,580
some help with this was the right person
help me with this your name comes up

434
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,439
you're good to go

435
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,520
I'm at this point often to your writing
the job descriptions for the job your

436
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,059
house

437
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,299
which is kinda makes I'm

438
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,950
I'm you also get save this is how much
money I need to turn

439
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:13,480
I it's not so much about which band
urine or

440
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,669
whether or not somebody's interested in
giving you money for that mostly because

441
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,330
they have no idea what you do but you're
there to help them

442
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,639
you there to fix them you hack

443
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:29,760
and many pics do it again

444
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,919
with the beer company

445
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:37,360
our government to send a nice post card

446
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,830
and the last 15 minutes

447
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,939
your neck guys want to talk to see I so

448
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:50,940
what you need to know russians Siamod
start

449
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,149
yes

450
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:14,149
you just he said

451
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:21,539
a good selling point is any starting
point frankly

452
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,350
because you're still that proving your
credit point of view do you have what it

453
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,429
takes to do

454
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,330
%uh search go back on full stop most
organizations don't have to attract

455
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:33,990
management

456
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:37,129
most organizations don't have technical
track where

457
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:40,440
you just deal with people on whether or
not they're doing their job

458
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,520
and a separate human management track

459
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,010
you know that that's very 22nd century
and I hope we get there someday

460
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,070
most organizations are integrated so not
only do you have to

461
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,129
manage people doing the work that
they're supposed to be doing

462
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,129
but you also have to cover fuzzy will
have to make them feel better and deal

463
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:58,570
with benefits and holidays and sick time
and

464
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,500
and all that stuff so you that for sort
of

465
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,950
team lead position is probably gonna be
more technical than anything

466
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,710
it's gonna be last line manager but the
first chance you can get to get line

467
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,129
managers you can say

468
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:16,340
you know in a very long bird kind of way
you're gonna have seven people under you

469
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,590
that's orchard reference not something
that belongs in the talking for some

470
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,179
I'm once you get to that point where
your

471
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,789
able to say yes I've had 10 people
working for me

472
00:29:27,789 --> 00:29:32,149
or I had a team 22 you know once you're
out back kinda point

473
00:29:32,149 --> 00:29:35,289
that's what i'm talking to and say
you're sorry bout that first real

474
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:36,710
management job

475
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,720
where you're in a position where you're
not able to do a lot of the work

476
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,799
you don't think about Tom I'd techno
Center kind of work

477
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,559
versus business focus kinda work techno
Center kinda works you're doing

478
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,658
as well as managing business focus

479
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,970
you're managing other people are doing
and

480
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,240
that's that's a critical gap where
you're losing your credit because you're

481
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,600
not touching equipment anymore you're
not dealing with the policies

482
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,340
you're not actually contributing to the
effort your orchestrating the effort

483
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,360
you know the orchestra leader never has
an instrument

484
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,960
Matt Sorum where you need to be you know
to move up to the next up because

485
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,070
in most organizations myself included
the CISO has no direct reports

486
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,918
I don't have heads up anyone I have

487
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,770
about 400 people work in IT department

488
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,270
who are indirect reports they all have
to do I say

489
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,789
by I'm not responsible for

490
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:38,789
others from a row

491
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,549
that's the social engineering part

492
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:50,240
you have to deal with the politics of it
but you can deal with them

493
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,070
on your footing right I'm you can set it
up

494
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,200
in such a way that essentially this is
passive aggression played out attacking

495
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,280
where you're following the rules and
doing it their way

496
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,770
and you keep a special piece a paper
beside your desk

497
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,350
where you write all the things you're
thinking while you're talking on the

498
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,730
phone with the nice lady in HR

499
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:15,530
right and just create that schizophrenic
personality

500
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,510
no maintain maintain the schizophrenia
that allows you to be

501
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,950
the hacker dude at car at the core
conference and also the person who wears

502
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,580
a suit

503
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,280
and tells people of how and how not to
manage the information

504
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,980
that doesn't really belong to them
because its other peoples I'm

505
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,250
but in terms of actually managing
politics I'm much like you heard from

506
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,059
other speakers

507
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,168
sometimes you have to work within the
confines the system

508
00:31:40,169 --> 00:31:43,690
and do what you can to change the system

509
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,169
and to a greater or lesser extent that's
the point where I'm at right now and and

510
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:47,490
this

511
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,730
more personal Charles anything um
personal challenge

512
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,290
I need to shift the whole organization
over to a real risk management

513
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:59,168
kind of mentality in order for it to you
grow to the next level

514
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:02,669
you know what your stock is a glass
ceiling there because we're managing the

515
00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:04,790
way that we manage where half the size
we are now

516
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,950
and in order to get past that need to do
a major organizational shift

517
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,980
and it's entirely outside my area you
know

518
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,040
I have a very confined this is what you
do

519
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,440
I need to change something over here and
the only way to do that is to you

520
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,590
influence that change or to cause them
to

521
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,620
have that idea I think the Socratic
Method when you try to explain something

522
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,200
so many

523
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,320
get it back from them so becomes their
idea and it's just

524
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,639
playing a game at the end of the day you
got I would purge whatever raids you

525
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,220
maintain as part of that game

526
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,570
I'm you know rages great can be power

527
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,760
but you have to channel it control it
I'm play racquetball

528
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,010
until you wreck your first few rockets
I'm

529
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,710
yeah you could have to learn how to play
golf I have to learn how to play golf

530
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,110
are you up golf I'm so I can help you
with that

531
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,210
was another question about midway back
okay I got one to three so

532
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:10,210
of a point in the middle yes

533
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,960
house yes

534
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,440
so ice

535
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,870
I'm getting changer title I'll

536
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,100
yeah well you get your getting your
credit in the public sector

537
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,250
and and that might be enough right there
um

538
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:38,790
if it's ok if it's a possibility if you
spend at least a year there is time

539
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,460
shuffle on

540
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,970
moved to a job where you can get sorted
at least 50 percent

541
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,670
not fixing printers I

542
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:50,980
you know it happens to everybody
everybody have relatives

543
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,810
everybody fix the relatives computers
everybody can break the relatives

544
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,909
tonight using Windows

545
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,330
yeah it's a struggle but ongoing

546
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm that's really what you're facing
about point it's it's time

547
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,090
and this is that this actually
negotiating leverage point but you can

548
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,800
use early on back when you're still
between step 1 step 2

549
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,990
leverage for a better title you know I

550
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,500
a title that has less sock because
oftentimes that the people who are

551
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,850
looking to resume our necessarily gonna
check

552
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,790
what was going on like what the real
confines of your job work

553
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,779
but if your title sounds about right
then you're in about the right kinda

554
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,010
place if you can get a title that says
something like

555
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,710
manager IT infrastructure there's just
one person

556
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,760
who has no direct reports but

557
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,700
you know if you can get that title on
that butterfly within the confines of

558
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,780
love the organization here with at a
reasonable way to get to the end

559
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,260
help right goal

560
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:56,260
this way legitimately

561
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,490
do you volunteer you should

562
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:05,110
this couple different ways you can play
that out

563
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:09,740
how one is out to find an organization
within your community

564
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,540
that needs help think not-for-profits
there's there's some even fairly large

565
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,650
not-for-profits

566
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,360
that really don't have some other basic
infrastructure stumbling down well

567
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,550
arm thats yeah exactly

568
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:24,190
feedback is a great option where where
you're almost even into the

569
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,280
manufacturing kinda

570
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,390
ironical that point and not some slick
all

571
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,020
aback main faction but I mean its
warehousing distribution right and they

572
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,720
may have stuff that's sort of how

573
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,590
work stuff that doesn't work but that's
an opportunity to build that and again

574
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,500
it's almost like

575
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,620
the previous question your your writing
the resume credentials yourself

576
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,500
at that point it what you do on your own
time with your own energy

577
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,890
can convert into what the next job looks
like that side

578
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:57,890
yep

579
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:07,220
yes um

580
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,020
in large part it's because how
technology people have a predilection

581
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,009
for blinky lights and shiny things

582
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,980
and you need to find a way to solve your
personal protection with blinking lights

583
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,040
and shiny things

584
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,250
while doing other things like audit
accounting

585
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:25,330
and I know it sounds awful but
unaccounted counts for a lot more you

586
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,210
know about that kind of mindset that
says

587
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,460
I can find the kinky thing that's got
less to do with shiny

588
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:35,410
and blinky I'm ice all the shiny oblique
you think by spending money on toys

589
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,790
having he and it'll have to be in type
and soldering and stuff

590
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:43,070
and that takes care about her to my
mindset so that I can deal with

591
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,370
the I have to review access permissions
for file server

592
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:52,089
gets thr false or worse there's a really
not

593
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,130
who not really anybody else you can do
it with the organization

594
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,520
I got a review to make sure it's clean
and that's going to take me a day and

595
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,440
it's gonna suck

596
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,220
and I can't delegate it I'd love to

597
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:07,800
but i cant I'm in terms of how you
manage that delegation thing

598
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,120
you've got to be prepared to let go you
know it's it's it's almost a

599
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,850
Christian just kinda phrase I'm going
just let it happen

600
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,080
and that's really really hard for
technology people

601
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,560
especially our control freak monkey
tight

602
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,190
two sons who really cannot what does
every password

603
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,610
I at this point I don't have a password
on anything at work

604
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,680
I have a password on my box at home and
that's it

605
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,020
and that's really the way it should be
you know

606
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:40,300
oftentimes vendors will laugh when I say
we'll just install this thing on your

607
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,760
computer or

608
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,130
I cannot I'm a normal user at work you
know I can install software my computer

609
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:45,670
at all

610
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,890
just for I'm getting to the point where
you can let go that kind of

611
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,520
power trip is really hard and you're
right that's a

612
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,110
real place for failure occurs absolutely
behind you

613
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:04,110
how do I recommend circumventing the HR
gatekeepers

614
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,029
I these two ways to answer that question

615
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,000
one way will generally land you I'm at
the behest of the Queen

616
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,180
or country depending on which country
you're in I

617
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,089
that's not a good way to get around them
the other way spark

618
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,380
first thing that comes to mind you'll
have a HR I

619
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:26,740
but the real way to get around

620
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,260
a.m. not circumvent so much to sidestep
the HR issues

621
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,680
I is literally to work within the
confines of their rules

622
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,490
right this this is yet another hack I HR
people

623
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:42,570
are generally power mongers they're
generally

624
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:46,440
people who think their type-a
personalities but aren't I

625
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,830
and they set up this by Zinedine set of
rules that theoretically only they

626
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,700
understand

627
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,110
and I will tell you this right now you
are a better intuitive processor rules

628
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:58,530
simply by being a hacker than anything
else

629
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,600
find out what the rules ideas and then
find

630
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:05,390
the friction free pass through it there
is a friction free path they don't want

631
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,690
you to know that it's there

632
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,080
they like to keep that information
themselves by you into it

633
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,720
large systems very well sir love the
classic definitional

634
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,650
hacker things you can intuit a very
large complex system

635
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:24,650
and see how it can be flexed your need
hack I would be okay with that

636
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:30,020
unfortunately I would have to pass them
back through that system

637
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:34,700
and should I have somebody buy me a cup
of coffee and explain why they think

638
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,900
they are the next

639
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,260
hotshot for my team I be a lot more

640
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,060
in line with that goes back to the
professional organizations thing I'm

641
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,930
find out who you know or who knows me on
probably not the case in this room but

642
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,140
in some rooms I'm you know one or two
problem

643
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,720
abstractions apart from almost everybody
in the room so you may well know

644
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,010
somebody who knows me

645
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,620
who can get back kinda in and I would be
true out wherever you're trying to get

646
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:01,259
that work

647
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,700
so find out who knows who and find a way
to get on that person's agenda

648
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,820
even for fifteen minute conversation
little

649
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:15,820
said

650
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,750
the the

651
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,500
the out that the best way to manage the
Trop really is

652
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:30,839
that's a set of politics that you don't
need to be involved in you can be an

653
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,820
attendee

654
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,750
or member you don't want to be in charge
yawn be pushed to be in charge you don't

655
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,520
need to be on the board of whatever the

656
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,830
local I'm information security
professionals group is

657
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,130
I'm you know just attend be a fly on the
wall pickup which can pick up

658
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:50,310
I'm you know some those are sir and nods
and smiles that happen

659
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:53,400
when you're in the room you like okay I
know you you're here to shit

660
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,720
I kinda stuff %ah

661
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,310
that's what I'm tired when in terms of
managing night you don't want to become

662
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:04,279
a board member one of those groups as
much as they love you too because that's

663
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,160
a whole nother so the politics that your
work with

664
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,270
that really cuts in your leisure time I
spend your leisure time whatever is

665
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:13,800
that turns your crank i mean i i coach
T-ball so

666
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,900
you know yeah I know totally gonna fly
to keep typed

667
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:21,460
working people lotsa fun I'm spend your
time wisely otherwise

668
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,810
in the meantime what time

669
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,290
russians ago one in front and then one
behind

670
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:35,290
yep

671
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:39,740
all this is a good one in the corporate
world how do you get beyond the negative

672
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,730
connotations are being hacker related

673
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:44,700
sheesh top

674
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:48,370
um like Wallace have they might find out

675
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:52,970
ok I really wat what you've got to do is

676
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:57,380
is present there's there's a possibility
to learn from these sorts of events

677
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,410
I'm and this for me represents

678
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,710
serious and significant professional
accreditation

679
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,050
and I'll give you an example because I
hope you wrap your head around it like I

680
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,120
said we're good enough I

681
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:12,120
financial institution if I nerd speak
I'm

682
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,509
they were talking about doing a roller
contactless credit cards

683
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,990
and I said okay or we need to look
seriously about what the controls were

684
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,890
gonna have around these risks are like
or you talking about I said okay

685
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:25,720
which contactless credit card many more
companies and what specific technologies

686
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,540
like okay that's great armpits got about
seven different ways that's already been

687
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,090
broken

688
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,510
and I said what and of course the vendor
had never

689
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,540
told the biz deal they operate business
types a by the way three or four years

690
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,310
ago at the other conference

691
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,970
um we show them packing this from 75
feet away you know they like what can

692
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,950
only be read within

693
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:47,780
four inches of the reader well not only
be activated within four inches the

694
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,810
reader but it can be read from anything
that could hear radio signal for any

695
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,910
distance up to

696
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:57,710
offer ways for journal you know its

697
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,760
ish with this this is real credential
building time right because if you're

698
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,300
if you want those very staid a headset
CISSP sans types if jack is one of your

699
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,090
favorite words

700
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:11,880
I'm you never going to be in a position
to really know and understand that

701
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,090
and then going back about 9 threads in
the conversation

702
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,590
we're talking about ways to gather that
credential experience I'm

703
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,970
great example the the province I love em
scare when the country

704
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:25,330
is currently rolling out a contactless
fair system

705
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,680
for mass transit the rolling out based
on the My Fair card

706
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,690
her conversation with the guy he's like
wall

707
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:36,710
it's perfectly secure in his knowledge
great

708
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,920
obviously vendors gone so we had a red
team look at it are you aware the

709
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,800
information to be released in the fall

710
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,370
was leaked last week I'm he said no i i
hadn't heard that before

711
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:50,270
actually and so thats I an opening for
conversation where

712
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,970
I yet easier because already dot a
business card looks really

713
00:43:53,970 --> 00:43:58,080
nice but that's the opening for a work
with your community help your community

714
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,150
show them that

715
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,710
hacker is often a misuse term by the
media

716
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,850
hacker really means the same thing that
DIY

717
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,640
meant in 1954 in Popular Mechanics right

718
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,970
and that's just the world right with the
makers with the remake urs

719
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:16,390
were filing warranties and and doing
crazy things like

720
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:20,350
convincing people to do things that are
kinda funny you know classic kak

721
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,509
misdirect the output from church to the
donut store

722
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,060
every time out sir gets a little orange
cones

723
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,080
where safety vest using flashlights
people will go where you tell them

724
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:36,410
a whole areas hack the actual credit for
that is to my wife we did that after

725
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,899
football game at high school it's the
best story in

726
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:45,900
how was proof that I'm a great person
out there is pressure behind you

727
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,420
okay let me summarize that question a
little more briefly to what extent are

728
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,340
people suited for management or not
suited for management

729
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:05,300
I'm much like the rules around who gets
to be president

730
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,400
I'm if you want to be President

731
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,480
you should be automatically disqualified
from the job if you want to be

732
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:14,610
management you should be automatically
disqualified from being management

733
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:19,050
because nobody wants that and if they do
there something horribly terribly wrong

734
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,290
I I don't like managing

735
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:25,740
like I said I'm I got you know a few
hundred indirect reports to

736
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,390
have to convinced to do what I want
without ever actually saying

737
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:35,109
do what I say because that only works
with very very small children

738
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,740
I if you

739
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,350
don't want to be in management you're
probably in the right place to do a

740
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:42,450
really good job but

741
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:46,260
do you know what this thing called the
imposter syndrome the

742
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,490
this is a good one imposter syndrome is
very important if you think

743
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,070
but you are so totally over your head
and they're gonna catch you

744
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:56,340
any day now because you do not know what
you're doing is playing at this

745
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,820
your absolutely wrong I spent the last
45 minutes before I got here

746
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:05,530
absolutely freaking out I wouldn't get a
single of there will be a pin drop after

747
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,280
pin drop

748
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:10,650
and I got 4 p.m. drops which is a lot
less like after dawn

749
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:14,130
so I did well right that's imposter
syndrome

750
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,500
I was convinced that I would suck and
instead have

751
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,110
being okay with that I live

752
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:26,220
not okay with that constantly balancing
myself against an impostor syndrome

753
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:30,060
you're going to encounter people out
there who know that they are the cats

754
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:30,610
ass

755
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:35,260
right they are the hottest thing going
they're the best manager in the world

756
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:39,290
they got the perfect desk with perfect
way from the perfect kids in the perfect

757
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,440
flower vase and and you know what
they're really not

758
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,910
they're the ones were faking and as soon
as you push them a little hard

759
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,940
they break down completely hackers being
the kind of people they are

760
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,820
tend to be able to take a lot more push
than normal people can take

761
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,310
you're sorta your the ten-percent that
actually does things in this world

762
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:06,310
as opposed to the eighty-some percent
that don't I did not do well in math

763
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,400
really didn't do well enough

764
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,400
back there I don't know because they
didn't exist until three years ago

765
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,440
%ah and and you know it's the honest
truth we're just starting to see

766
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,890
graduate from programs like that I'm

767
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,000
what I can tell you about the corporate
in for a sec world is that everyone who

768
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,560
I know who's doing well

769
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:36,380
does not have a computer or IT related
degree in their past

770
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,100
their business degrees they are
accountants

771
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,210
they are auditors they are liberal arts
majors their geography majors

772
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:50,200
their his history majors and poli sci
majors do really really well in InfoSec

773
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,670
I'm there almost anything butt Comp Sci
and

774
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,880
I haven't seen real tangible results of
those firsts

775
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,430
I'm programs other than the email to
keep showing up in my inbox telling me

776
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:01,270
that I need to go

777
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:08,270
good yep a prank

778
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:14,710
I'm

779
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:18,070
I think the most important thing would
be to going to yourself a universal

780
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:18,740
education

781
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:22,710
a pink and we call them university's
role in colleges its to get universal

782
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,440
education you have to be able to learn

783
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,360
most people come out of school
especially multiple years a

784
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,270
post-secondary

785
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:33,080
completely unable to learn on their own
have to be talked I'm

786
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,110
in large part I'm entirely self-taught

787
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:39,770
I do have several university-level
courses behind me the deal with business

788
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:42,790
stuff and economics and things are
really kind of hard to

789
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:47,190
cogitate on alone I'm I don't think the
education is so much

790
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,270
important as your ability to learn and
learn quickly think the classic

791
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,180
statement is

792
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,250
you know you know Thomas office often I
don't know that

793
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,580
I don't know that particular solution
today talk to me tomorrow

794
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:02,890
because between now and tomorrow I can
learn it that

795
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,990
I

796
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:09,570
shift I was hoping to should notice um

797
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:13,810
I yeah exactly I spend an awful lot of
time

798
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:18,029
reviewing other people's work I spend a
lot of time in meetings

799
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,360
I what sixty percent meetings I was the
other people's work I should say project

800
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,120
teams

801
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,160
I'm decisions that are being made by
people were saying we need to make this

802
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,490
respect decision that says

803
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,970
we're gonna do this terribly risky thing
but we think we've covered it often

804
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,350
enough control so it's okay

805
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,690
I spent a lot of time managing internal
external audits

806
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:43,080
helping them understand right policy I

807
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,279
I haven't done that in the years most
see ISO's don't

808
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,640
largest I should say most people were
actually doing the job of sea ice OCE

809
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,910
don't there's a technical level job in
there that's called something like

810
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,470
director IT security

811
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,740
or vice president responsible for IT
security

812
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,460
and that's the person who manages
technical preventive controls

813
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,660
but I'll tell you in my experience
technical preventive controls generally

814
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,319
don't work

815
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,210
they're incredibly brutal I they break
the next time somebody comes out with a

816
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,550
new market vertical for you

817
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:16,090
I'm they just they they do not play well
in the real world

818
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:19,310
mostly spent a lot of time and effort on
detective controls

819
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:23,080
and other sorts compensating controls
that will catch things

820
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:26,259
I'm this is the classic you can't build
a perfect lock

821
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,970
but you can build awfully good system
tell you when the Hawks violated

822
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,980
I

823
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:38,640
I do not use the word security at all in
my day-to-day life

824
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,890
I do not use the word security light
awkward information management and the

825
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:44,799
way that I help them is by giving them
tangible things that they can take home

826
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,450
and use

827
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:50,110
show them the things that are wrong you
know the classic you keep your arse 85

828
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:50,970
with your laptop

829
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:54,000
do you also put your keys in the front
or your house

830
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,710
and just leave them there all the time
you know are they both the

831
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,590
adviser your car yelled just walk them
through that the practical implications

832
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,480
of it teach them you know this is what
your kid is doing

833
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,710
you don't think you're cute is violating
your little Net Nanny program tell you

834
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:09,090
what

835
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:13,410
they are and here's how and show them
those things in a very real intention

836
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:13,680
away

837
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,440
double session up lunch learns there's
lunch and learns for people have

838
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,390
teenagers lunch and learns for preteens

839
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:22,690
where we teach them everything they need
to know about social networking and web

840
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:23,990
2.0 whatever

841
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:27,360
and help them through that say this is
what Facebook is all about this is what

842
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,500
myspace is all about

843
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,660
he the kids today have no expectation of
privacy this is what their version of

844
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,920
private means and walk them through all
that stuff

845
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,540
but it's like an education that works
much much better

846
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:44,890
and saying know and don't has no and
don't doesn't resonate with anyone

847
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:48,730
most people when they got ten slots in
their head for don't and no

848
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,840
and of those ten slots they violated
almost all but one of them

849
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,230
there's have special places for people
violate that tenth one

850
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:59,760
it just it does not play it well so you
give them tools that are very tangible

851
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,830
very visceral

852
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:04,770
I'm use biological terminology somebody
wants to put their

853
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,740
information in your repository are you
okay with that

854
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,579
have you considered protecting that
transaction

855
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:17,019
question over there

856
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:20,039
so

857
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:27,039
yes

858
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:32,710
yes

859
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:37,720
pursued you

860
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,820
for yeah you can't because after you can
quote the works for whoever wants

861
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:45,220
everyone my greatest cruise was that I
helped a major international

862
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,420
telecommunications company through a
significant breach of their internal

863
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,080
systems

864
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,450
there was a loss potential real loss not
a lawyer made up lost potential real

865
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:55,090
loss over fourteen million dollars

866
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:58,810
there's three people in jail and will be
in jail for another 15 years as a result

867
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,560
involved international litigation
international corporation wants police

868
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:03,320
forces

869
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:09,290
it never made newspaper and I can talk
about it great resume material how do

870
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:09,910
you write that

871
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:16,910
just like that and absolutely I think

872
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,980
if are you in california

873
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:34,980
after and and do please be careful going
in for a sec research on your own

874
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:40,310
spade says chilling fact bad things
happen to people brought up other

875
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,700
people's problems in public

876
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:46,880
so gonna be careful about the
unfortunate but yes chilling effect

877
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,000
especially in this country

878
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,140
I love this country has some rather
draconian laws

879
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,509
in that regard time for one last
question

880
00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:01,300
the Oregon yep

881
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:06,350
I've done on

882
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:11,779
my way up I'm not at the top yet I i
hope to be at the top 10 but no two

883
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,310
years

884
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:15,540
top being defined as global organization

885
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:19,820
50,000 possibly is I expect to be there
with another two to three years

886
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:24,300
I've got a cap your like a business
credentials seems to be the cap for most

887
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:24,830
people

888
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:29,370
so if you can go back and pick up a like
a CPA preparatory course

889
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:33,109
there's a a great way to start this
process on your own for free there's

890
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,570
this thing called personal MBA

891
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:38,500
with up on your personal MBA and it's
essentially all the book learning

892
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,490
but in a standard EMBA course so it's
like getting an MBA with a piece of

893
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:44,740
paper and for free

894
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,660
later on if you feel it's necessary go
back and pick up thirty India

895
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,529
and that's what I'm thank you all very
much
