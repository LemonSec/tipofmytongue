1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:03,389
deepest teaches several %ah course there
and

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,120
I also were for myself I have an office
in Portland Maine

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,270
and said open one in cambridge
massachusetts hopefully and I

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,590
help people set up tech companies by I'm
here because some research I was doing

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,510
at the University

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,200
over the past two years I've had
students who were reading about to be

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,540
alive

8
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,110
Real ID Act and about security
vulnerabilities with RFID

9
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,460
and last year had one student do

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,180
a paper on that and this year ahead for
so it's so

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,250
it's a topic that a lot even computer
science are interested in and

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,610
a lot of attorneys from the law school
been interested in the subjects as well

13
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,850
so I thought I do a little research

14
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,710
and present to you some research that my
students brought to me and

15
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,500
homes in which I didn't on my own it's
not it's generally not technical

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,290
research

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,120
what it is is a I'm talking about the
law's legislation

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,399
and privacy issues I I'm really for

19
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,210
civil liberty protection so I'll talk a
lot more about that now tell you a

20
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,829
little bit about passports

21
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,209
the new requirements for passports 3

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,950
requirements for getting a driver's
license in some states it's changing

23
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:12,240
um so I'll tell you a little bit about
that as we go on

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
as my professional background as I
mentioned

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,240
I'm a professor she said the main and I
at work for my companies and you'll see

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,059
networks

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,770
as is my educational background it's sad

28
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,420
not as important to to 1 I'm talking
about specifically today

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,259
except that I've studied in three
countries so every country that

30
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,130
I've I study tonight I like to learn
about the the technical culture there

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,380
the legal environment and policies
regarding civil rights

32
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,479
I'll talk about the history of RFID just
today

33
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,539
and and this is an historic a
presentation but

34
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,279
its kinda important to I think we're
talking about the tools and how the

35
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,380
technologies used

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,259
a description of the technology tracking
a good some packages such as

37
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,439
documents mostly biological
implantations insertions party my

38
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:01,249
backgrounds

39
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,149
also in biology a I love computer
science and biology in

40
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:09,190
back in college a I like to study a lot
about viruses and the biological Tay

41
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,930
and then in grad school I started
setting up more about on

42
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,390
about the the digital type and they're
fascinating added

43
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,110
the similarities between the biological
and Israel virus is really quite

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,690
intriguing and the Real ID Act what it's
going to mean for you

45
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:27,640
when there you go to get them your
driver's license or you wanna walk into

46
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,020
a post office or open a bank account its
gonna change the way that

47
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,860
that you do your day-to-day activities
and the way the business is done

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,990
and I'm gonna be this year because you
can't read message I think especially in

49
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,540
the back

50
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,230
but and a blogger wrote about this a few
months ago

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,380
and I thought it was it was kinda it was
for fascinating the State Department

52
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,170
today has unveiled plans to improve a
national ID Act put into action twenty

53
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,210
years ago today

54
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,710
on May 8 2008 the citizen was required
to carry a card containing their social

55
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,130
security number date of birth physical
address

56
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,710
various parametric features as well as
an RFID chip

57
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,000
the RFID chip has made tremendous
strides in its ability to help the

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,650
public

59
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,130
failure to carry the national ID card
resulted in print imprisonment as a

60
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,900
sponsor an anti-government actions

61
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,220
these tears have been removed from
society and pose less of a threat than

62
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,170
ever before

63
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,520
today the government has made the
process even easier an effort to prevent

64
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,950
pollution from the plastic required to
make a national ID cards

65
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,030
you're invited to get your new
compulsory organized RFID regional

66
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,310
universe no personal tech

67
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:32,030
right for short correct will be implied
in your form and provide you the same

68
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,050
great benefits you have grown accustomed
to

69
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,110
some others benefits you already take
advantage at using its technology

70
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,690
traffic officials have been able to
locate congested driving Aires by

71
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,470
track and Tara tracking individual
drivers with this information they've

72
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,090
been able to

73
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:49,890
reroute traffic to other areas police
officers have used this technology to

74
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,660
locate criminals and missing victims

75
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,299
statement department stores have use
information gathered from your

76
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,870
purchasing habits to better produce
advertisements that are important to you

77
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,980
I'll debit credit and other financial
accounts a condensed into one card

78
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,650
reason I chose this is a he's writing as
if he were in 2020 a

79
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,870
um there are benefits and detriments to

80
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,389
any type a technology whether it's a an
old fashion or even new lock picking kit

81
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,569
lot picking tools from when I under
center generally not legal

82
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:23,710
to you has asked especially carry with
you if you fly airplanes you

83
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,998
wouldn't want that coming up when you're
going through security but

84
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:30,180
the lock picking set in itself is not
something I consider to be

85
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,759
evil it's not bad it's what you do with
it and how it's used

86
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,189
and I think the same is true with RFID
it has great benefits that can provide

87
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:39,300
is actually it's I'm having a fantastic
time

88
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,939
this is that I governor the RFID tags
here playing the game

89
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:46,949
but also every now and then I had wanted
to pop the battery out

90
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:50,379
headquarters in the hotel I have that
option to but if you're carrying a

91
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,819
national ID card

92
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,539
that is your driver's license and you're
supposed to carry it at home

93
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:59,050
produced well in some states you have to
carry it and show it upon being asked by

94
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,569
police officer

95
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:03,569
on you have to carry with you at all
times and there is no what you can do to

96
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:03,909
just

97
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,699
you turn it off are talking about
passive and active the difference

98
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:08,960
between the two that

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,870
how the attack technologies applied was
what makes a good or bad

100
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:17,999
not the technology itself I think well
for the this is a good example the

101
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:21,229
history of RFID is in 1939

102
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,550
it was used to tell friend from foe and
I guess you could say it was good or bad

103
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,120
depending on which side you are on

104
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,800
they invented an a there's a leon sarin
invented the soviet espionage listening

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,650
device

106
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,509
and a passive radio transponder was 16
the memory was and then in 1973

107
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,939
from what distance Kenny singles as
signals be receiving it it depends on

108
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,620
what type of RFID device you're using

109
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,669
um this was interesting when I was at
Def Con I think it was

110
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,900
maybe I can remember maybe about four
years ago I'm a couple in

111
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,270
guy show that from a passive RFID device
could be picked up from 69 feet away

112
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,270
and they had a directional antenna I
have some photos are then I'm gonna show

113
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,308
you next but

114
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:07,389
it some and a lot of things that I've
read

115
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,650
I don't think a lotta congressmen and
senators really get this that

116
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,659
and it's not half you can walk into a
building and expect

117
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:19,110
that your driver's licenses is gonna
remain in your pocket and yours and your

118
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,300
ID is

119
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,520
is you could be anonymous or not um

120
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,628
it's not something you can take for
granted anymore

121
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,330
so the bad news is and if you work for
one of these companies where r fi di

122
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:31,969
security

123
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,039
your card you know you to get into
buildings relies upon the physical

124
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,740
distance from a reader that's night

125
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,909
this is not good in these guys were some
the first to show that in

126
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:43,248
this was on I borrow these photos from
Make Magazine

127
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:47,249
and I remember when this was done and
upcoming it was a really big deal at the

128
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:47,819
time

129
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,139
on these are the directional antennas
that's a box that they put together it

130
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:55,069
was a very expensive and there is an
article in make about how you can do

131
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,119
this yourself

132
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:59,889
and other guys today and just look on
make

133
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,580
magazine dot com if you want to learn
how to build room your own

134
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,650
components have an RFID generally

135
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,409
if it contains an integrated circuit for
storing processing information as well

136
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,879
as much winning Indy marshalling

137
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,219
for an RF signal has an antenna catch up
with our values are printed directly

138
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,150
onto

139
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,749
ahead onto paper onto I read that maybe
the post office may be doing this for

140
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:25,439
some stuff that they like to track

141
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,639
tracking a good social retailing and

142
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,020
this is something that i think is is
pretty interesting that I think a lot of

143
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,808
young people are going to be using this
as an

144
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:38,449
when they don't know there's our Site C
and some other clothing

145
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,860
that kids are trying on cuz I think
right now a lot of the

146
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,399
really high-end retailers especially in
california are putting these and other

147
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,180
close and you walk into a dressing room
put your stuff up on the hook

148
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,869
and you can tell your friends hey this
is this is what I wanna buy

149
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:57,939
what do you think about it on you can
then walk up to the cash register to

150
00:07:57,939 --> 00:07:58,899
keep track

151
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:03,319
love all the items that you had been
there and with some credit cards I don't

152
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,119
have any have

153
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:08,259
them right haha some credit cards you
don't even have to really take it out

154
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:10,439
and have it be scanned it's paid for a
few

155
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,379
if you choose and there's a these are
some other clothing

156
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,009
the articles of clothing that contain
that I mean there are many but this is

157
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:20,800
just some I found an RFID Journal

158
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,899
um and now I is from social retelling on
a talk a little bit about

159
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:29,909
other types a bar fight d this is not
RFID this is radioactive dust

160
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,220
and radioactive dust was used in the
nineteen seventies

161
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,800
their plane would fly low over a bunch
of insurgents and drop some stuff on

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,400
them

163
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,030
and then all agents would have to do
later on is going to attend the Geiger

164
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,620
counter to see

165
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,710
what what came up and

166
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:51,180
they can track people later after two
then after the group has dispersed

167
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,720
and I thought about this um when

168
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,170
I was looking into RFID powder and

169
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,229
Hitachi said that it's for
anti-counterfeit

170
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,300
on purposes putting it into my

171
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,990
and two dollar bills on but its it's
very small

172
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,080
and you can really see it I have a
picture next about how tiny it is

173
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,310
but as if this wasn't small enough they
made it even smaller

174
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:21,350
and their nests and if that dust was
blown

175
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,540
into a room at people think that a it
would be hard to detect a I think

176
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,839
and then you have to wonder about why
isn't this

177
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,990
the small I don't know what I touch is
doing with this I guess it's going into

178
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,660
even better anti-counterfeit

179
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,569
and head monetary a monetary seasons but
a

180
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:43,260
I don't it's pretty small and it reminds
me of the angel dust story and my dad

181
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,470
spoke a little bit earlier today he used
to be a

182
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,720
you CIA agent nineteen seventies and he
told me a lot of stories such as this

183
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,610
one

184
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:53,020
and about the angel dust and now in

185
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,980
in my generation I'm thinking about this
one when I

186
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,130
we talked a little bit about the
industrial activity and what can be done

187
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,860
with this

188
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,860
um the documents this is something that

189
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,370
thats I'm most interested in is %uh
personal identifying information

190
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,030
that connects you to all the purchases
you make

191
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,520
from when you drive a 95 with your
transponder its RFID

192
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,199
an it's connected to lot of people that
has to be connected your credit card

193
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,740
and i miss u wanna pay cash and then if
you're going through New Jersey as i've

194
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,440
discover how many trips between I live
in Maine in DC

195
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,700
it's really a hassle they make you go
through a lot if you don't wanna use

196
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,220
your

197
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:37,090
on the EZ Pass now you have to pay cash
in any way in line

198
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,330
so it's becoming more difficult to stay
anonymous in today's society

199
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,130
and especially documents and credit
cards

200
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,270
on like this one for instance they knew
about some of the security flaws and I

201
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,400
think just like

202
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,360
a lot of arm very eager suffer Company
shall we say

203
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,190
they wanted to get their product out to
be one of the first to do it and the

204
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:00,300
kind I think about security later

205
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,510
and from coming from in the engineering
department

206
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,500
and cue well computer science department
we talk about how to teach students from

207
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,160
the bottom

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,300
hot how to engineer systems from scratch
and build security

209
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,590
into your code because if you just put
out something that works you know well

210
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,450
well great maybe you get beyond that has
helped but to make something

211
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:23,120
that is not just you don't release it
into the public

212
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,530
just because it works but make it smart
make it smarter

213
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,550
and include security in your code is
there are different ways as I'm sure

214
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,620
many you know out there

215
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,680
at had a design hardware and software
from the bottom up to make

216
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,980
security party for design and not
something you to stack on leader

217
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,910
and that's one of the criticisms I have
from a lot of these companies they can

218
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,439
attack the security on Weiner

219
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,770
on there's a US patent application that
was filed here for american express

220
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,800
it calls on it's for consumer tracking
consumers

221
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,620
to watch people in stores and if you
thought wal-mart's

222
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,350
wal-mart was bad enough they put ours ID
tags on a lot of their products right

223
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,830
now

224
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,030
and they don't tell you about it there
have been a few cases about this but

225
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,860
on wal-mart says they're using it for
management purposes so that they can

226
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,630
tell us a lot of people are around this

227
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,150
this type of shampoo where this this
product and they can move it out to the

228
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,040
end caps

229
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,660
and I we learned about this business
school have this was a really great

230
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,319
thing and also for inventory tracking in
this

231
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,840
black I think when they apply it to
people who walk in the stores

232
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,550
and they really but it is on for privacy
purposes if you walk into a public place

233
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,730
like Walmart

234
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,340
and they have surveillance cameras you
don't have an expectation

235
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,180
a privacy wherever you go in that store
you know other cameras there this

236
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,790
weather and now in the pack much they
put up those big size

237
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,099
say like surveillance cameras in use um

238
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,430
whenever you do in that store day Dame
they watch that they store it

239
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,790
and the question it's questionable to me
is how long do they keep that

240
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,990
information and what purpose the user is
really for marketing purposes because

241
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:00,690
a a lot I've you their faces on there
too and I read some

242
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,390
somewhere that sum up the surveillance
cameras can use and

243
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:08,330
a geometrics for your face to be able to
determine

244
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,630
who you are it doesn't work very well
right now but

245
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,830
it's getting there and well for

246
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,630
American Express's patton the businesses
would pick up the signal used to

247
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,810
identify shoppers track thomason observe
their behavior

248
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,020
an american express senior executives
vowed that they wouldn't do

249
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,900
RFID based consumer tracking without
providing notice to consumers

250
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,830
and as I get to know what it later on a
couple states have now passed

251
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,560
on pass laws that say that if you're
using RFID

252
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,790
you hand and the card or four different
devices you have to tell consumers about

253
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,400
it

254
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,720
the problem is more states have passed
laws like this but I hope it's coming in

255
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,110
part the reason I want to give this
presentation is a

256
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,930
and other people Cummins conference from
all over the country over the world take

257
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,790
go do something about it because I'm
unfortunately I believe that most amor

258
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,189
senators and congressmen

259
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,430
don't have a really good grasp on
technology

260
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:04,610
and but people here do and what you can
do is write letters to your Congressman

261
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,390
your senator

262
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,750
and say it was from this is not OK to
Real ID Act its is we're just not ready

263
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,710
for that yet here in America do
something

264
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,980
about it and wait a little bit before
some until some the security kinks are

265
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,290
worked out in this before this becomes
something that all of us in america have

266
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,319
to carry

267
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,500
and as I get to the very end the
presentation the Chinese are already

268
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,020
carrying RFID

269
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,569
identification cards and has a lot of
very personal information on it that

270
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,760
the people in China don't really know
specifically what's in their file

271
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,319
anything even if they do what they do
how do you get that out with the chinese

272
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,620
government

273
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,090
on lol for example with this American
Express credit card

274
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,870
and it reminds me of a scene from
Minority Report tab

275
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,820
beds in on this you can display a moving
or static image a performance have a

276
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,320
sound recorder even emission test that
while you're walking through restore

277
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,530
that would really annoying me instead of
just the perfume girl said that the

278
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,010
department stores it would just

279
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,090
you know you wouldn't even know where
they're coming from even be able to

280
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,470
avoid them it would be

281
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,350
it would just be you are John Smith you
must like this

282
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,590
sup particular brand so we're gonna for
you hit you

283
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,200
just fab this clown unknown security
vulnerabilities as I mentioned

284
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,950
the No swipe credit cards on are been a
problem

285
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,110
I heard that the security and encryption
is pretty good but it's not rate

286
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,200
a member of the Senate Banking Committee
had denounced RFID does my credit cards

287
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,380
at a press conference and this was in
2006 0

288
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,290
have far we've come you know from 2006
not a great deal

289
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,610
but one of the senators said that town
contracts for this card should have

290
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,290
morning boxes disclosing

291
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,949
the known weaknesses that this
technology and he pretty much said that

292
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,990
he may as well where your credit card
information with the big sign on your

293
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,810
back

294
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:49,830
and there now you may have heard about
these guys at the University of

295
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,230
Massachusetts in Amherst

296
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,390
one of them got it new credit card in
the mail and it happened to be RFID

297
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,520
enabled

298
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I'm so he was able to without even
opening the

299
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,329
the envelope he was able to determined
that

300
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,520
his name his credit card number
expiration date

301
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,410
this was being he could read this
without even opening the envelope which

302
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,589
I ever the converse NYers blog someone
did this with passports recently to you

303
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,120
didn't even have to let open up the
envelope and take the

304
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,940
the you know the passport out other
must've been open a little bit inside

305
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,230
but they were able to get digital
photographs and and all that just in the

306
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,279
mail by am getting it out of someone's
mailbox who was

307
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,590
part of this who knew what was happening
and this is

308
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,279
I want the professors here the this is
one of the experiments they did they

309
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,279
said okay how can we make this a little
bit better

310
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,370
I there he got you have the name has
been transmitted without encryption

311
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,230
which is

312
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,910
which is really a surprising and in
plain text

313
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,360
couple together he called us together
for a pretty cheap a mountainous was

314
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,700
this was a a while ago and I think you
could probably make this for

315
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,870
a lot cheaper a couple my students were
gonna make some RFID readers they said

316
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,250
they could do it for about

317
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:03,120
twenty-five dollars on our department
didn't want to spend

318
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,280
the money on it at the time but we have
more interested in part now but RFID and

319
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:07,689
maybe

320
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:10,910
that's something that on the students
will put together next year

321
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:14,709
the solution I they came up with a
method that uses the concept of random

322
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:18,410
numbers which are used to encrypt the
data that is being sent by the tags

323
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,990
produces a line a random numbers you
know that's that's easy but RFID tags

324
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,079
are the sizeof

325
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,000
a matchbook and the circuits are really
tiny and that they not been able to

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,850
handle the random number process

327
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,580
and this message relies on the fact that
sound memory cells in the tech news all

328
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,679
this information that is stored and then
when the power supplies removed

329
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,200
now I want to talk last night out a
little bit about have that maintains

330
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,160
that bad

331
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,850
I'm so the University Massachusetts some
solution was when the tag is powered up

332
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,399
by the receiver some the memory cells
fluctuate

333
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,130
between the two partners States before
they settle and this is what they used

334
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,260
to create a series of numbers that allow
they are fed authenticate itself to

335
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,240
reading device

336
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,809
well I went to the talk last night about
the Col du and

337
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:03,580
this this may not be on this may not be

338
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,689
something that that is the solution but

339
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,690
the this is their research and I think
it was was better than

340
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,930
with pecan in the mail which was no
protection on their card at all

341
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,170
eye-tracking a car's and this is
something that had the press recently

342
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,840
I think about a few months ago I read a
lot about this but on

343
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,280
our flight D is not an OnStar but if you
have a car that has OnStar really the

344
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,950
only way to

345
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,500
to turn it off is to sever the power to
the device

346
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,460
on just getting into the car computer
and saying turn off it doesn't work

347
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,040
um so when people buy OnStar all the sea

348
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,840
I think the general consumers all they
see the commercials where he had a tree

349
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,800
OnStar signals to EMS you come get me
I'm here

350
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,149
um but it can also be turned on by law
enforcement

351
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,650
and it can be turned on possibly by my
hair

352
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,400
people that are participating in
malicious hacking and

353
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,250
that's one of the reasons when I was
looking in a car right shows one that

354
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,930
did not have OnStar

355
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,700
and perhaps most people would choose an
OnStar vehicle

356
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,010
most people I think general consumers
would but they

357
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,750
been thinking about this like people ask
me what what's the problem with OnStar

358
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,640
do have something to hide I get that
question a lot if you're trying to be

359
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,990
anonymous in society

360
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,510
why you know I'm what's the problem with
that and it's just it's not the fact

361
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,740
that it's something to higher but it's
the fact that

362
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,540
it's a little bit a civil liberties that
I wanna try to maintain post

363
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,649
posted with the DMCA the Patriot Act

364
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:33,470
I will these combined together it's
becoming harder and harder to do this

365
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:37,450
and we get a lot more questions and I've
talked I just had to another

366
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,680
where the yesterday like I talked to
Alex and he was saying that it's

367
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,000
becoming really difficult

368
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,020
to work in the legal profession and be
able to

369
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,240
say hey I got a hacker conference is
because people for stuff like well

370
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,010
you know that's a lot of people asking
what would you wanna do that are so many

371
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,020
criminals are like I'm one actor
conferences

372
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,320
sensor and eight years ago up

373
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,159
I

374
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,380
well her I'll tell you what are the
reasons I

375
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,570
got interested in doing this is on when
I was an undergrad school I was a

376
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,800
Carnegie Mellon

377
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,950
and I just heard a little bit about what
was going on with kevin Mitnick

378
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,040
and what was going on with Bernie s and
it really upset me a lot

379
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,280
and thinking can I do about this I was I
felt like

380
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,100
I her Kevin speak many times and when
his presentation tonight

381
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,770
I heard him say you know I I know I
broke the law I did these things

382
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:32,389
but I don't believe that the punishment
really was was fair

383
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,710
and I've read about the way that the
just

384
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:38,980
the judge reviewed his case being able
to

385
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,420
whistle tones to connect to the internet
when you're in jail the launch missiles

386
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,550
I thought that was a joke when I heard
it and I thought how could

387
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:49,790
you know it's a I thought that people in
the legal community amenities YouTube a

388
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,678
customer to go to law school record
become a judge me you really gotta

389
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,880
can be really smart to do that okay well
yet maybe

390
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,960
be there they're very smart people that
do these things but they don't have my

391
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,490
background in technology

392
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,740
and computer science or with it. and
what scares me is when people like kevin

393
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,230
get into the system

394
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,070
you're in a system with most people that
don't have any background in this

395
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,230
so are you gonna get a fair trial I

396
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:19,360
I worried that that the answer was no
and melodic cases there people by

397
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,570
Jennifer granite that

398
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,919
she was when my inspirations to an and
what's yeah this is great

399
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,820
and went to law school because these
things bother me

400
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,280
and I wanted to figure out like how
could

401
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,340
when Bernie s was in jail why did they
put him in a jail

402
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,600
with on some pretty hardcore criminals
and I i kno he had some

403
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,720
some pretty bad experiences in jail he
was beaten up in jail I'm

404
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,860
heard this on a presentation he did I
think hackers in jail

405
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,690
the last hope that I'm 22 years ago and
it bothers me so

406
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,450
on that's why I had developed a
background in technology

407
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,510
and I am attorney and what I'm trying to
do is to educate

408
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,290
people in the legal community people
making legislation

409
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:05,500
and just to be able to say hey there
there a lot of people out here and I

410
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,809
want people to come to these conferences
that if you

411
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:11,720
ask for some help if there's some aspect
if the techno what you don't understand

412
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,400
there's some people they care so much
about these issues no comments here

413
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,450
to tell you about it I mean that judge
caplan

414
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,140
maybe he kinda a California he heard the
Microsoft case

415
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,980
I think that if he was more open to

416
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,800
a lot of people from this community
saying hey I'll tell you about what this

417
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,500
means

418
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,780
I'll tell you what does patton these
patents to differ in history

419
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:36,540
and I think it might maybe it'll change
a little bit of the judicial system and

420
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,490
how they handle have

421
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,690
on hackers so we'll have fewer hackers
in

422
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,130
and presents a specially in town in have

423
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,620
like the maximum security prisons I
don't get hurt hot that's really

424
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,970
unfortunate did you have a question

425
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,330
a multiple question on I'll take the
others afterwards if a

426
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,470
could you speak up for one microphone
speak up

427
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,590
okay hope

428
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:02,159
want these sick

429
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,850
is that 3 for in law

430
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:09,790
from because most people focus on

431
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:16,040
reading the wall him

432
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,940
is there any crosses road track

433
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,890
free for judges and lawyers

434
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:33,890
Z

435
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,200
day

436
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,230
frykowski you

437
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:50,230
you

438
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,260
yeah I'm glad you asked that question
because I mean every phrase is for

439
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,210
people who didn't hear

440
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,240
the first by the question is is there
any training for

441
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,910
law students are there any programs you
can do in the answer is yes

442
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,270
and is there any training for and I'll
tell you all my little bit more about

443
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,570
that in the second and is there any
training for

444
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:23,450
or judges and is there going to ever be
a special court system

445
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,309
just for computer crimes and I think
know for both for those unfortunately

446
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:28,590
but I'll tell you a bit more

447
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,870
I had the privilege of what I want to
learn I wanted

448
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,920
main up School of Law and other reason
we settled on Adams we're in Seattle my

449
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,370
husband was was working for big

450
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:40,620
suffer company out there and we wanted
to go someplace to the ocean near the

451
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,970
mountains and I got a mainline I
interviewed there and they said hey we

452
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,490
have a technology Law Center

453
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,710
so Mike great it's near the ocean I surf
I has a snowboard ski for

454
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:54,179
XI I get there and its virtual an email
address

455
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,690
and I was like man this is this is
really tough because I night as the

456
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,300
school for

457
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,970
months reasons that was a really big one
so when I got there one beef

458
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,780
there was a group a technology in law
student group and they still exist if

459
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,070
they have a different name now

460
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,300
and but they we got together we ordered
pizza with our budget pretty pets

461
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,530
and we talked about these issues me we
had done

462
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,410
we had some seminars we once a month we
try to bring in

463
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,920
speaker to talk to the law school and
the students about these issues

464
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,470
and it was pretty successful from what I
hear now the group grew from five and I

465
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,900
was there to their over 20 who regularly
attend

466
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,780
which is great because some we're also
getting more people with computer

467
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,059
science and IT backgrounds applying to
law school and we need more

468
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,590
we definitely need more because I think
it's really I love you

469
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:42,830
when you choose to if you choose to go
into law on

470
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:46,340
traditionally to study this like I did
you have to take around an intellectual

471
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:50,400
property because a lot of what goes on
with with computer crimes has to do with

472
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,820
well a lot of what you learn about the
cases is when

473
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,020
contractor violated their usually
intellectual property violations as well

474
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,020
and corporations care a lot about that
but what I'd like to see more

475
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:06,160
is the criminal law developed on the
criminal our programs Moscow developed

476
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,800
to include a lot more a cyber crimes

477
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,929
and main school all right now we went
through an email address

478
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:14,730
to now they have a center for innovation
and technology they have clinical

479
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,740
programs where people can come in

480
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,320
and I take cases there mostly in IP
right now

481
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,450
but I have plans to try to combine the
computer science department

482
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,170
and the law school in your program where
we can take more cyber crimes cases

483
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:29,960
federal

484
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,400
we don't have a lot on Main going on but
for federal cases

485
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,970
I could take people from all over the
country to work on that and I have some

486
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,100
people interested people my method of
kind

487
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,870
to last year who were law students so
and that so many people who are going

488
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,210
into law that I'm

489
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,050
better from it. in CS backgrounds it's
so fantastic is when I applied

490
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:53,080
I felt like kind of like when we've read
cases like on

491
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,120
reread a record release cases and
manuals QC is Kayson

492
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,900
remember I'm people would ask me about
it I did the presentation for that

493
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,800
because I am

494
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,850
a I really enjoy that type of law and
after that the professors every time

495
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:07,770
they say it hacker they kinda look at me

496
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,200
and and be like yeah yeah I know their
case and

497
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,929
yeah I am hacker now tell you why that's
not a negative turn

498
00:27:14,929 --> 00:27:18,520
even in law when you read a lot a legal
cases they still say hacker hacker is

499
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,370
as in a malicious type but sad now it's
it's changing

500
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,150
and but we need more people in nineteen
CS to come into the field

501
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,810
and and and I'll tell you are smart
enough to do it

502
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,710
I mean if you can do for discrete math
into a lot a program

503
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:37,310
and you're gonna be able to have a law
school just fantastically and I'm really

504
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:40,480
glad to hear that they're more going
into it as for the judicial program

505
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,390
I've been working on trying to set up a
nonprofit group I

506
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:47,800
I'm trying to name a hacker law and
having a little bit resistance and legal

507
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,620
community because there's still this on
the way as mentioned the idea that

508
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,020
hacker mean something illegal

509
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,650
but I wanted name hacker what I wanted
to set up a judicial training program

510
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,750
where do judges have to go through
continuing traditional

511
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,710
legal education just like lawyers do so
in addition to educating summer the

512
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:06,169
older lawyers for their continuing legal
education credits about cyber law

513
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:07,030
cybercrimes

514
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,139
that's not just intellectual property
about patten's it's more about

515
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,900
so many cases you really it would be
nice if some other judges actually knew

516
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,380
how to analyze code

517
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:20,160
because I truly believe that when
someone's being prosecuted for a crime

518
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,500
on if it's a computer crime it's kinda
like you look at

519
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,600
they look at the results okay this is
what was broken this is what was taken

520
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,650
this is the financial amount that

521
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,280
that is at stake in this case on that
phrases like sign in the humidex case

522
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,530
claims the damage

523
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,300
but if you actually look at how the
crime was done I believe it you have to

524
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,440
open up a coded take a look this maybe
doesn't apply for the script kiddies

525
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,740
but for people that are being tried as
some because

526
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:49,610
I love you in here if you commit a crime
in many view know if you

527
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,350
have done some time I'm you're
considered to be experts

528
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:57,530
so even if you were seventeen you might
be tried as an adult because they look

529
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,490
at your

530
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:01,590
on the gym the legal system looks at you
what you can do

531
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:06,090
as being on elevating your back from the
criminal aspects are you might actually

532
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,669
get more time

533
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:11,720
because and because you're your your
really good CS

534
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,179
in nineteen if the prosecution can prove
that it's more difficult for you

535
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:20,790
but if it comes to I often look at with
the regular case is a criminal act like

536
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,450
if you break into a building

537
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:27,210
and how you got into the building is
very important that can show intent

538
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,370
and so there's a difference between as
you all know just releasing call that

539
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,490
other people have written that the
script kiddie thing

540
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:36,560
and a lot of them don't really have any
idea about the damage it can cause

541
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,100
I guess some you know that Morris is
kinda on with worms

542
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,980
kinda like that in that case that he
really had no idea that was a good

543
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,000
defense

544
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,270
but that doesn't fly so well anymore so

545
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,860
I believe it'll be great if judges and
lawyers could break down the code or

546
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,000
look at the hardware that she used to
say okay let's see

547
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,060
how much intact how much planning was in
part because and other crimes makes a

548
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,210
very big difference

549
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,240
so on and thank you for asking that
question because I i would like to see

550
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,280
more education for judges and lawyers

551
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,250
and who were kinda from the from on a
lot of them are in their forties and

552
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,720
fifties and this wasn't

553
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,290
they're there for in the forties fifties
age and that this wasn't something that

554
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,750
they studied law school was all about
contracts property

555
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,840
on and now even when I went to law
school if you were interested in

556
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,020
computers you have it's really the eye
and watch for property track

557
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,240
so thank you for asking that question I

558
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,650
as though I admit I devote about
tracking a car's gonna have to mention

559
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,510
that

560
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:36,870
and review that 2004 I think it was too
hopes ago nothing face presented hope

561
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,530
about the benefits of hacking your
on-board computer

562
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:42,879
one thing I gotta say is not much about
the MCA with that

563
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,320
but there are going to be tire pressure
monitoring systems

564
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,418
in cars on well actually there they're
here now

565
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:53,450
but in a 2005 National Highway and
Traffic Safety Administration issued a

566
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,620
rule saying they have to be in there

567
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,890
on one of the problems is is that you
can read them using a directional

568
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,480
antenna you don't have to be ready like
right up close against the tire

569
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,490
and that concerns me for security
purposes and

570
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,810
if if it does have a unique identifiers
you wanna know

571
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:13,020
if someone is going to a specific
location

572
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,280
if you if you follow them out when on
their driving around in town

573
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,399
find out what that uniquely identify
risks and then

574
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,659
I set up a reader wherever you think
they might be going

575
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:26,820
on and you'll see you know if you'll be
able to tell if they're they're not

576
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,470
without actually

577
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,380
being you won't have to be there you
don't have to physically approach them

578
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,890
in

579
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:36,010
you know say hey I have you been there
don't the information will be there

580
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:39,050
and okay government-issued ID

581
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,100
what were the results of the secure
password trials in the Netherlands

582
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,070
kisses will be different in the credit
cards that I was talking about

583
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,810
I have a lot to say about passports I
have to I'm a citizen the US in a min

584
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,860
I'm also a dual citizen of Latvia

585
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,070
and um by have my US passport

586
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,710
I renewed right before an RFID came in
on as mandatory but my life in passports

587
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:01,370
probably gonna contain RFID

588
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,020
so actually yesterday I went down stairs
to the second-floor apartment as wallets

589
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,540
from a nice guy name a

590
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:11,168
Michael I believe in that its if my
passport my passport not gonna be open

591
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:14,030
it's not going to be able to be read if
I haven't won it is well it's the best I

592
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,710
can and I got one from my

593
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:19,679
my dad's you can see he has let him pass
but as well but the secure pass for

594
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,520
trails in the Netherlands it was cracked

595
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,629
so fast I think was in like manner hours

596
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,700
on it was read remotely and then the
security

597
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,929
cracked the flaws using they were built
into the system

598
00:32:30,929 --> 00:32:34,740
where and other biometric data could be
rad and

599
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,010
the skimming exercise was was concerning
and this was back in 2006

600
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,490
on this is hard to the same case after
intercepting the data security can be

601
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,080
broken on a PC in just two hours data
birth visual image in fingerprints were

602
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,040
all they're out in the open

603
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,389
secret he is made up for the passport
expiration date birth date and the

604
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:56,830
passport number stored on the passports
machine-readable zone

605
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:00,200
what was that most bothersome to the
computer science students I tell about

606
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:00,649
this

607
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:03,770
is that the last digit in the number is
a check some

608
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,800
that's one an introduction to
programming that's one of the things you

609
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,909
figure out if I call you think some
worked out right that's like I've really

610
00:33:09,909 --> 00:33:11,159
control thing

611
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:15,690
how did that get into the encryption for
are you know these passports

612
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,970
contract is yet I'm gonna get in and
co-write

613
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,310
my passport is the the one on the left

614
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,610
the one on the right is my two-year-old
son's passport has the RFID

615
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,840
and there's nothing there's nothing that
I can do about it

616
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,929
although on I'll get to a word article
that tells

617
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:35,360
that can suggest something you can do
about it but you know that you put your

618
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,169
passport you his password is not your
property

619
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:41,990
it belongs to the US government so when
you mess with that mess with the US

620
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,790
government just to let you know give you
warning about that but

621
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,570
I one of the things we didn't we renewed
our passports as we don't give our

622
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,050
social security numbers out for anything
except for taxes

623
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:55,220
and even then my had two kids now and we
did not

624
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,300
we was such securities for them until
their ready to decide on their own

625
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,399
because it is being used as a national
ID number there's a doctor in Maine you

626
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:06,610
wouldn't treat me because I wouldn't
give them my social security number

627
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:09,950
I told my health insurance doesn't even
have it they don't need it

628
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,589
there's no reason for you to have and
they said well you know our database

629
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:14,199
that's the key for it

630
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,899
said you know what that's not a unique
identify the right people at the same

631
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:18,460
social security numbers

632
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,199
and they said hey sorry we can get you
in a system we can't reach you

633
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,879
so I sent them couple letters you know
letterhead from the university and I

634
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,350
said you know that that's that's really

635
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:31,540
that's not good so Michael what I'm

636
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,219
when I'm suggesting here is on you don't
always need to disclose your social

637
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,120
security number but how that to the US
passport office

638
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,850
I'm with someone from a government
agency asked for your number they are

639
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,020
required to provide a and the 1974
Privacy Act

640
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:48,199
had requires disclosure it's a notice
which is required to tell you what law

641
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,210
allows and ask whether you have to
provide your number what will happen if

642
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,240
you don't provide it

643
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,490
so if you turn over the application for
password is what I really scary wording

644
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,530
on the back

645
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,160
but actually um there's another computer
group I'm so psyched to see this was a

646
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,379
arms computer professionals for social
responsibility group who have

647
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,609
they have a letter that when you reply
for your passport you send us with it

648
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:09,390
not tell you how her down for me

649
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,670
we apply for password you can refuse
review on your social security number to

650
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,010
the passport office

651
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:17,830
and instead mail a notice to the IRS
it's kinda like you're doing business

652
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,210
with the government

653
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,630
when you have to know your social
security number to the IRS because some

654
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:25,780
your well that's that's how the tax law
get on with this

655
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,200
and why the IRS needs it but the
passport office really

656
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,670
doesn't I'm if you but you do have to do
is give

657
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:36,870
only your social security number and
onto the to the IRS and notified

658
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:40,210
passport office that your giving us to
the IRS

659
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:43,290
so I'll tell you what happened with us
on here's the letter if you go to the

660
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:43,910
website

661
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:47,399
i'm for computer professionals for
social responsibility .org they have a I

662
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,700
can letter here

663
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:52,670
and this is the one that we use almost
exactly and don't tell me this now under

664
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,700
saying that and when I post this if you
wanna

665
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,080
on take a look at the letter Veritas
sorry on how this works for half

666
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,230
at the same time my husband I we didn't
do the joint application because we

667
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,089
wanted to do a little bit of experiment

668
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:07,750
I'm we both male and our separate paths
for new applications without disclosing

669
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,010
national security number on the on the
form

670
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:13,330
including the envelopes was a letter to
the IRS and certified mail with return

671
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,440
receipt

672
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,630
so that we can confirm that the letter
disclosing our social security numbers

673
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,500
to the IRS was

674
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,880
on open by the US passport office was
put back into the mail

675
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,350
and sent to the IRS all right if we get
the returns he's back

676
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,900
yes okay my husband's return receive was
returned as three weeks

677
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,900
after mine was return his look great

678
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,720
it actually was sent and received no
cent to the IRS received by the aris you

679
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,880
can see the stamp

680
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,030
the stamp their okay now here's mine

681
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,760
a Citigroup somehow got mine and I have
no idea how to write

682
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:48,620
and there's also a big boot print on it
I guess it didn't scan very well I don't

683
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,190
know where this thing when when I
suspect happen

684
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,200
is someone at the US passport office
actually did open up my envelope this is

685
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,570
why we set the application separate a/c

686
00:36:56,570 --> 00:37:00,660
and then they look to me said up I know
like a crappy we gotta put this back in

687
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,810
the mail I do you know anyone who can
stamp this was something just a

688
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:07,040
so this person's happy when I get the
returners the back so maybe some with

689
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,700
Hannah someone works Citigroup with
stamping

690
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:14,150
and this would happen in mine came back
on very strangely very way

691
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,690
sewer I guess I'm gonna rights to on the
guy who have from the computer

692
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,760
responsiveness confessions for social
responsibility or maybe cinema DVDs

693
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,920
and tell like a we had a fifty percent
you have returned on this

694
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,370
bed nitsa it's a start so if more people
know about this

695
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:36,589
on you can give it a try but hey this is
a legal information I'm giving sewer

696
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:40,690
don't take it as such but add we we give
this a try we have other experiments

697
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,740
that we tried if I have time I'll tell
you about a few more them

698
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,430
about carrying ID's the airports to you
but the Real ID Act in citizenship

699
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,399
just talking a little bit about
citizenship and the password and check

700
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,670
this out a guy

701
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,960
um in new hampshire claims that he's a
citizen a new hampshire not in the US

702
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,030
and got a US passport

703
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:02,060
so he did is so he didn't have to pay
federal taxes

704
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,339
he disagreed with where tax money was
spent on

705
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:09,299
this is he said that when he took if you
watch this video on if you go to this

706
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,740
this URL there's a video he tells how he
did it

707
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,690
he said that he took his application to
the passport office in boston they said

708
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,089
this is not the first time

709
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:19,009
we've had to do something like this for
people claiming you know they live in

710
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:19,600
Irvine

711
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,480
issues with the live free or die state
so on which is new hampshire

712
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,460
and so that is one way to someone's got
the passport a different way than

713
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,510
and then I did i right what's on your
passport

714
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,510
depends on the Asian country American
passports containing gender birth date

715
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,200
and birthplace I'm your passport number
issue date expiration dates additional

716
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,589
version ever photo

717
00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:44,140
and they say their social security
number and address and not on the chat

718
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,910
and the state department says that the
chips friends about four inches and i

719
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,000
cant be ready when the password is fully
closed yeah I want to render

720
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,160
random and said he was right %um his
presentation last nine

721
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,089
yes but if your passport open just a
tiny bit and your pocket

722
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:00,350
that's when there is some security
vulnerability and

723
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,630
I'm I'll actually in passport additional
photos on it right now

724
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:07,880
but by 2009 my fingerprints are gonna be
on it so I am gonna renew before

725
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,609
that happens and wait and eventually in
10 years I'm gonna have to renew again

726
00:39:11,609 --> 00:39:14,450
by then maybe the security flaws will
have been worked out

727
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:19,109
either damn biometric data on is if you
get arrested now for a federal crime

728
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,950
on the FBI's gonna take a lot of
pictures your tattoos another

729
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,670
identifying information

730
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,480
and their story in a facility in West
Virginia and um

731
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,569
what said they're doing with that um and
as the guy

732
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:35,120
give a presentation this morning about
surveillance devices it's in your

733
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:39,630
it's in your on FBI record what's in it
and how to change it

734
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:43,310
he claims it's not possible on I I don't
know

735
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:46,620
the truth in that I don't personally
know any FBI agents but I I do know is

736
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,350
very hard to find out what's on your
record unless it's a criminal record you

737
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,630
know what you can charge for

738
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,790
but other data that they collected on
you it's there so

739
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,779
on one of the things that I've been
cautious about is there some airports in

740
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:02,790
Europe that when you go through they
take biometric scans and I know one of

741
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,670
them is Frankfurt in Germany

742
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:09,130
and I'm trying to find that airport I
fly other places where I need to go to

743
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,650
Europe because I don't really want that
data

744
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,520
and some database about me right now but
its peak getting to the point where

745
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,280
if I don't want this is going to be
really tough to fly through Europe

746
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,440
because on

747
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:24,839
somebody scans release: difficult to
track and fax near impossible

748
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,740
so if you travel Europe ally itself it's
gonna be on someone's database it might

749
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,940
even going to some bar fight

750
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:37,940
your party or passport if you go through
those countries

751
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:44,120
you right now you say the only have to
give biometric if you wanna skip it

752
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:48,000
I have it be you passports why might be
able to get around some of these

753
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,910
but for those of you that don't have to
westwards more when I travel light

754
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,379
I don't and I don't Schobel for them
that's really bad

755
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,430
but on this night illegal but it's just
not a good thing

756
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:01,200
who wrote the encryption for the
passport okay this is something that I I

757
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,750
was shocked when I read this in
washington ties with the US government

758
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:08,140
outsourcing corruption developments were
European company and that European

759
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,720
company had a company in Taiwan right
the encryption

760
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,950
yeah this is bad on one bus he was
talking about outsourcing some really

761
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,100
important security stuff

762
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,120
this is a great example if their that
the US government said that the US

763
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,029
didn't have the technology to do it here
in the US

764
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:26,130
yeah I happen to think it was more for
financial reasons it's like a while

765
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,250
other jobs are outsourced

766
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,640
mmm good and Bangladesh okay yeah

767
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,560
passport encryption was stolen alright
and

768
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,930
they don't they it was divall Shin
report in October 2007 had finally at

769
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,009
The Hague that China had stolen

770
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,210
the patented technology and use for the
past four trips

771
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,980
judgeships I believe it was the
algorithm I'm GPO

772
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:54,010
on was use the was using the UN Security
on this is not a thing was back here in

773
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:57,280
the US they were using on secured FedEx
courier services

774
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,440
to send blank passports the state
department offices until securities

775
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,000
concerns were raised

776
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,380
and the blank passports are really hot
on the black market because you can make

777
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,210
that and

778
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,500
you can be anyone you want with service
on

779
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,080
the GPO was forced to use an armored car
company but the agency propose using a

780
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,100
for an armored car company vendor before
the State Department no diplomatic

781
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,240
yeah services objected this was
concerning

782
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:24,690
meaner government if they really that
concerned about security let's try

783
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,960
I mean much these are companies are
checked out really really well and I'll

784
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,900
tell you if

785
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,670
if a European company had a lotta
business with a Chinese company that was

786
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,560
doing the coating I would say if I was
working for the government

787
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,859
let's be a little bit more cautious
about that and China's Great there I

788
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:40,170
think they're going to be the next for

789
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,210
your first home country up in common I'm
but

790
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,660
they have a lot of security issues over
there I studied law over there for

791
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,670
summer

792
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:52,250
and cash we had a to Chinese agents in
our group they're americans

793
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,250
law students Chinese law students we
didn't know who the Chinese government

794
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,460
agents were

795
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:00,210
bite on their kinda there to make sure
that we weren't working for the CIA

796
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,280
our naval intelligence or something like
that on but

797
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,100
china's not exactly our friend just yet
so I will say

798
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,140
keep the stuff in the US for companies
that have been checked out really well

799
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,799
don't outsource their

800
00:43:11,799 --> 00:43:15,060
and how are the passports made this is
important when you're thinking about

801
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:19,380
what happened with those blank passports
being sent by FedEx and the careers

802
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,069
the computer chips are answered in the
back covers the passports and the

803
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:23,180
Netherlands

804
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:26,720
by this company smart rack and now
playing covers are shipped to a factory

805
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,299
in thailand

806
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:31,600
and to be fitted with an RFID antenna
handling passwords eventually are

807
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,830
transported Washington DC for the final
binding

808
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:40,350
yeah well on I I think alive you heard
about this and this is why the concerns

809
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,270
I have when I carry my passport

810
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,859
if you become a pic my pocket cuz I do
travel to some countries

811
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:49,359
and I've spent a lot of time a South
America where I don't want people to

812
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,259
know more american

813
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,660
and I don't know which speaking was
saying about I do try to blend I really

814
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,299
do.

815
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,609
Anza I when I think I was worried when I
read about this

816
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:01,859
I don't have an hour for the past four
but my my two-year-old son does and I

817
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:04,040
probably carry for him now anyway

818
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,270
but I when I saw this about they pulled
is da me along a

819
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:11,460
a clothesline and when it got really
close to the trash can

820
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:15,150
Obama simulate a bomb went off it was
actually model rockets that were sent to

821
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:16,010
fire

822
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:19,029
when an american when a passport where
by

823
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:24,060
it got the RFID from that and that was
shown a black hair while ago and

824
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,870
um that bothered me a bit when I saw
that so on

825
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:30,940
apartment as well it's today yesterday

826
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,220
I don't want miles I guess the other
this happening are pretty slim but

827
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:38,330
I didn't like it when I saw that video
if you wanna watch the video I'll go to

828
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:42,020
their web sites to the company's website
and you can get on YouTube

829
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,089
alright I can't tell you how to do this
because like I said your passwords not

830
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:47,339
your property is the US government's but

831
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:50,970
wired in article and this is a can

832
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:54,940
best approach the Sun is effin you know
to do something with the antenna is the

833
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,790
use a heavy one object on it but I i
cant say that that's a good thing to do

834
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:00,540
because it's it's illegal

835
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,940
but wire publish this so I wanted to
pass along this information to you

836
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,400
washing it someone asked me yesterday
about being in a microwave you to burn

837
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,560
marks

838
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,560
result Matt and I don't know from
personal experience but that's what it

839
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,089
says here

840
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:18,220
and human implantation on I have a
little bit about here

841
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:21,310
about the same here because a couple
estates just passed a law saying it's

842
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,480
illegal for your employer to require

843
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,870
you to be shipped I remember at that
that hope two years ago I think

844
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:32,100
and we gotten Mike she was like the way
more dedicate my was she actually got

845
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,500
shipped for the presentation she showed
how easy it wasn't an

846
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,140
elevator for someone to come up and get
her information of her ham

847
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,220
on but at least it's still out there
there's a company in New England that

848
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,420
does your car this time if you wanna
work for this company they make you get

849
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,609
shipped and I think that that just on

850
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:52,049
it's just a violation number lot of
things back

851
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,940
there are health risks associated with
this and they you know various on

852
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,370
VeriChip knew about this from the
beginning you can get a lot about

853
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,750
companies from the SEC statements like
their

854
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,819
when they're on they have to disclose
certain information to investors

855
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:08,430
and one of the things that came out in
this where the health risks associated

856
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,560
with this

857
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,400
there it is that was really scary
looking but that's how that's the device

858
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,890
they use to check people

859
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:19,259
and and and question is the saddam
chipper

860
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,700
is a very ship that goes in people
there's a grain of rice below the two

861
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,400
chips

862
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,990
a dime for I got this from home spy
chips

863
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:30,069
someone really good book about that and

864
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:33,640
the top one is for you men's the bottom
one is for animals looks the same

865
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:34,879
doesn't

866
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,980
it some it's pretty big and I also heard
that when you wanna get it out they

867
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,819
don't really have that technique really

868
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:44,660
well well done yet so it hurts it hurts
a bit

869
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,529
to take it out on this guy here this
done its hasn't been proven

870
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:52,600
exactly yet that that it could possibly
cause cancer but dismisses the dog here

871
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:53,279
that

872
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:56,529
that they did claim died of cancer from
something from

873
00:46:56,529 --> 00:47:00,010
the RFID chip and also you can have an
MRI done on a party or body so if you

874
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,480
have a put your hand

875
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,569
and will you do for break your hand even
MRI done

876
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:08,150
it hurt had in Auburn they're done

877
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,190
they've had some problems with them here
this

878
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:14,100
their discs the average they wouldn't
disclose a small bit easier for the

879
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,630
chipped a lot of people

880
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:20,470
on you date some people in a Las Vegas
got shipped in a medical convention

881
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,490
I guess just to see what it was like and

882
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,750
there's there's the insertions aside
from one to the chips

883
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,010
this guy's kinda saying well you know
it's this is something that's

884
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,850
up-and-coming

885
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:35,319
on you just have to have to get used to
this idea

886
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,190
some okay thank you

887
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,680
okay and this is what I mentioned you
wisconsin says they can't mandate

888
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,410
implantations if you live in that state

889
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:48,950
and there's a huge fines for your
employer if they make you do that

890
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:52,960
other states New Hampshire and taxes
protests wal-mart's usage of this

891
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,130
it's not do generally about
implantations but it's about some

892
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,380
walking around getting products and
having them track you free crime

893
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,980
detectors this was another thing that I
and looked around a lot for

894
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,319
there too and I wanted to mention I'm
one of them is

895
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,580
if you work in Las Vegas in particular
casinos

896
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:13,240
you're going to get a wristband and if
your heart rate goes up

897
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:17,490
management's trigger that there might be
something going down and

898
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:20,160
you know what's what's concerning the me
as someone could just be thinking about

899
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,170
a stressful event that doesn't have
anything to do with them stealing from

900
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,250
the happiest

901
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:28,080
it just could be that they're sick you
could be a lot of reasons why

902
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,000
this would trigger but its associated
with their name I love that

903
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,500
and maybe they track how many times
someone's heart rate went up and how

904
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,440
that's a predisposition does that
suggest a predisposition committing a

905
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:39,480
crime

906
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,450
I don't really see that look how far
away three hundred feet that they can

907
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,510
pick this up

908
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:48,790
digestible RFID tags well I was reading
I guess Cup kodak's diversifying

909
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:53,279
when I would think about digestible
things I wouldn't think about Kodak

910
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:56,319
for Sabah but they say that these are
fragile I can see how there could be

911
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,710
really great medical

912
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:03,010
on purposes for this on but I can also
see how if you're on probation you're

913
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,510
not supposed to drink any alcohol or do
drugs

914
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,960
you have to sit by a reader swallow
something in this thing dissolves in

915
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:13,100
your stomach in a contest say what type
A drugs in your body and how long

916
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,750
it's been there so I kinda consider that
to be like a

917
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,339
a pre crime type device so on

918
00:49:20,339 --> 00:49:24,120
admitted there are good applications in
medical and research for this

919
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,259
personal RFID security I may go through
this quickly

920
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:30,260
if you're interested in a jammer just be
careful when I don't know that this

921
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:33,299
technology may tell you about is how it
jams it's a different

922
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:37,740
and the SEC has some requirements you
can't just the different ways a jamming

923
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:42,230
there is something that you can carry
that on Jan your r fi di devices

924
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:45,390
it's called The Guardian okay this is a
little bit about that and let me show

925
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,259
you a picture then if you're interested
in reading more about this

926
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,670
on email this professor he's a computer
science professor

927
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,490
I emailed a couple times I said my
department would like to test out where

928
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:58,290
these things I didn't hear back from her
neck think it's because I i'm in the US

929
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,980
those %uh view that are in europe you
might be able to get a free or cheap one

930
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:05,160
for her for research purposes to test it
out in their

931
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,520
is beyond URL if you're interested in
that

932
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,759
Real ID Act okay I have some time to
talk about this a pass in 2005

933
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,160
unanimously

934
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,950
and there was limited debate
unfortunately it was part is done

935
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:21,180
it was part of a buncha bills that if
you were senator congressman said in my

936
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,210
goal with this

937
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,430
you look pretty bad to use issuance and
you will be required when you drive a

938
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:27,970
car board a plane

939
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:31,779
get on a bus or if you're on you want a
post office

940
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,060
%uh I'm in a statement that was one
other states have said on hand and new

941
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:35,770
hampshire

942
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:39,520
14 states that we are not going to pass
the RFID

943
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,750
we're gonna actually pass legislation
saying we'll never have our on the RFID

944
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:44,420
for the REAL ID Act

945
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,260
but unfortunately for man when you read
why its financial

946
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:52,100
the privacy is Wilson is a number too
concerned by financial is number one

947
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,270
and this is from the state also were
senator Susan Collins just propose one

948
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,330
of the first %ah crimes bill

949
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:01,359
which is is worrisome to me home she's
really involved with Homeland Security

950
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:02,790
Department but I feel like she

951
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:06,490
maybe a lil bit misguided with some
other concerns about homegrown terrorism

952
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:09,839
but on stay if so what the federal
government said people in maine

953
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,200
is it sure you if you go through
portland's airport in Maine

954
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,819
you're gonna have to go through
supplemental screening and I tell you

955
00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:17,410
something briefly about this

956
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,980
if you're flying domestically you do not
have to

957
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,950
okay is not required by by US law that
you have to carry an ID

958
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:29,290
TSA once you have one and when you check
bags you have a contract with your

959
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,490
airline carrier

960
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,440
they may require you to have ID but he
got to TSA

961
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,980
say hey I don't have my ID with me can
you just can you just check me on what

962
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:41,560
they'll do is they'll patchy down do
extra screening

963
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,089
they're okay with that except about
three weeks ago

964
00:51:45,089 --> 00:51:48,600
and they said that they can if you don't
have ID they can

965
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,839
on deny you passing through security for

966
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,870
reasons that are not known and not
published I'm it's part of whatever

967
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:59,910
screening that they use and we've tested
this

968
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:05,200
on this was in December you walk into
perhaps a gas station by one of those

969
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,130
credit cards for $250 dollars on it
immediately go to your car log online

970
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:14,319
buy an airline ticket under perhaps
you're traveling under a pseudonym it's

971
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:18,049
Jon doe cuz maybe don't wanna get server
whatever whatever state you go to you

972
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:21,470
for whatever reason you can travel under
pseudonyms as long as its domestic

973
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:26,170
I mean we we live in and Union we're not
traveling over country borders when we

974
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,839
passed between like Maine New Hampshire
and Vermont

975
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:33,910
and John Doe gone on actually to news
Joe I think this Jay Smith who traveled

976
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:37,160
he on plan important got off in
Baltimore Washington Airport went to

977
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,470
supplemental screening did not have ID

978
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:44,160
and he traveled outweigh and there was
no problem and he just wanted to remain

979
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,190
anonymous foreign he was not a threat
but there was just no reason for him to

980
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,060
required yeah be required to carry that
but that the government help people in

981
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,720
maine your all you have to go through
something else green if you don't have

982
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,299
one it is real ID Act driver's licenses

983
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,640
better idea maybe an RFID card that you
actually have to be

984
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,129
make contact with something armistead
have it being scanned I know the TSA

985
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,210
things would be great

986
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,250
go through on security and just

987
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,380
be scanned that way easier for them but
maybe

988
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:17,420
you don't wanna traffic that way I'm
some states have an option for vision

989
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,359
I'm skimming a bar others RFID in
Washington state just past 10 the first

990
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,700
laws it says it's a crime to use game
others RFID cards from only

991
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,970
but it says here for the purposes of
fraud and just after some other legal

992
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:29,850
purpose

993
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,850
a traveling by the winner pseudonym is
not fried there no

994
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:37,230
there's no monetary fact going on so I
just moments now with

995
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,580
I'm as with the was got on this bill

996
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:43,890
I'm if you do scam summers are fighting
cards 10 years few

997
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:46,990
use it for criminal purposes the lawn
onto

998
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:50,510
on if you'll add on to that for your
jail time

999
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,940
okay the last two slides is our fight
usage in the UK

1000
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,839
and police request for information from
one is RFID bus transit cars were way up

1001
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:02,859
and last year and a pair that with the
information they get from others cameras

1002
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:03,740
in the UK

1003
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,240
they may be able to find out who you are
just not your number on your transit

1004
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,150
card

1005
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:13,200
and I like the ARF a tracking and hope
this was a lot of fun playing this game

1006
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,980
and it was voluntary detected you give
someone else a few

1007
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,700
teen 18 you can alter you could be set
your preferences once I

1008
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,080
had a theory about why they did that bad
on

1009
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,870
I this is an interesting way to use RFID
this way

1010
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:33,150
this is one of the ways that I worry
about RFID d technology could be used as

1011
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,510
the cards in China that they have right
now the government is installing RFID

1012
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,600
readers throughout this big huge city in
China

1013
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,810
and it's gonna be tracking the movements
a citizen's and US companies are helping

1014
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:47,330
deploy this technology but they track
your work history

1015
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:51,509
education religion ethnicity police
record in your reproductive history

1016
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:55,089
this is the type of information I don't
wanna see go in our cards if it does at

1017
00:54:55,089 --> 00:54:58,120
least wanna be able to find out what's
in from what information

1018
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,170
is on my heart about me so on

1019
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:05,290
alright then ends my talk right now and
do I have any time for questions

1020
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:10,440
no I doubt okay I'll be around the
conference on Friday mid next talk later

1021
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:10,930
so

1022
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,220
I'll I'll see you later thank you
