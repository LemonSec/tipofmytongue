1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,510
merge

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,330
you sewed looks like this by asking for
the largest make they didn't give us one

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,340
or to are you got 'em

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,170
hope not very good dresser back there

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:22,270
bring him up mean I I could yell that
for than might hit the making

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:29,270
its good

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,489
Ste

8
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,489
this

9
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,460
okay I in your do this again night night

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:01,670
so I'm like this is aired we're going to
talk a bit about

11
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,360
physical access control and sodium
because its control systems in

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,929
particular

13
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,010
this should be a pretty pretty broad
pretty broad talk to you know

14
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,390
sort of I talk a bit about some
different criteria in solid from metric

15
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,130
to use to evaluate security systems and

16
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,960
you know what makes it work goes into
making a good one what you need think

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,450
about when you're designing this

18
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,490
and we want to go in and talk a little
about a whole bunch of different

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,420
different access control techniques
different access control

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:32,100
systems so you're starting off when you
to sing in the

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,200
in access control system there lose 15
five main factor the need to think about

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,729
out when you're when you're sign you you
to worry about the error rate

23
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:43,399
rate because you can't have a a you know
he can you have to worry about whether

24
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,020
now you can afford to know your users
with fault reductions

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,030
yet worry about whether or not it's okay
to accept some false the

26
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:54,289
to accept some people accidentally even
if you know

27
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:58,160
song put in the wrong ID justice to
minimize the influence

28
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,979
are you to worry about how were bused
this is not be towards the environment

29
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,659
I unit is one thing that you can do to
nickerson robust but

30
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,229
and Lucky's that can drive up costing
involve a lot of other difficult

31
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,250
difficulty factors

32
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,730
you have to worry about the cost and the
rules on a bother you need to worry

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,920
about you know how vulnerable it is

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,840
that the first server assistant
introduce you to worry about the

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,930
complexity that system unit we were in
the others were

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,100
additional constraints rain even know
what else you want to ask yourself

37
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,200
you know world would also want to ask
the sales up before buying system

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,610
so when the first thing though I was
like that's the airy

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,180
how you how do you quantify the EV

40
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,540
ability a system to the tax will prevent
intrusion and the right way to do this

41
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,140
is the thing about the full 60 train the
false rejection

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,720
being civil disobedience or reading the
fraud rate in some sense q4 to piss off

43
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,329
your user

44
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:48,989
night and how much keys how much is it
worth to you to make your users angry

45
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:54,700
arm and then but you need to release or
two numbers they represent different

46
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,760
aspect respect from

47
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,890
I new one-third a dude

48
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,250
typical way to come across a.m. a single
number

49
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,980
to sorry quantify the quality the system
is a look at the Eagle Eyrie this is the

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,500
point at which the 460 for its been
tuned to be equal to the projects meet

51
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,970
essentially and basically the lower that
is

52
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,870
be a better system arm so you look at
the environment that way about the

53
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,380
we're not going to comment whether
whether you can deal with called with

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,410
you can deal with someone

55
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,760
being out with a baseball bat wakin do
all the other issues

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,870
you know he's the one thing you can do
you can in case a reader an apartment he

57
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,799
really can I am

58
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,699
use approx try to reconstruct card or
any kind of course markers or even

59
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:36,639
system that's

60
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,730
roughly resilience but then in some
cases you know

61
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,180
your system with a lot of moving parts
like your fancy

62
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,579
simple Q Locke might not be appropriate
for you know it

63
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,699
sub Saharan desert and it wasn't worried
about the cost

64
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,620
you're on a budget you can buy all sorts
of you upgrade crazy fancy systems

65
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,930
you know you leo very very willing to
sell you

66
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,310
you know unbelievably complicated
physical access control

67
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,720
but the price will be out this world

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,570
the Unreal and cause you to worry about

69
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,810
what happens when you try introducing
new systems

70
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,850
or Newport to an accidental system to in
existing

71
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,260
security protocol as in all other cases
be you're vulnerable even introduce

72
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,539
at the borders between two things so if
you have a standard or

73
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,320
with for example a.m. with a typical
lockset

74
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,469
double handle said it has aliens little
button the president and prevents you

75
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,150
from

76
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,810
open the door the credit card right
because it out

77
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,690
it'll essentially just logs everything
in place while the doors closed

78
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,600
but a lot a typical a the electric
strikes users for the

79
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,710
electric control dot ball watches a lot
of those

80
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,888
they require you to use a.m. the strike
is

81
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:53,419
too large for the is is so large

82
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,789
that the the button thats depressed when
the doors closed

83
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,810
actually just sits in the strike it
actually doesn't actually close

84
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,020
so you to really worry about if the you
to worry about all the

85
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,270
holes that were introduced

86
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,229
at the border system you and obviously
you need to worry about

87
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,760
you know over the obvious problems you
know you've worry about your request

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,560
exits entries can be defeated by Cigna
balloon underneath it up

89
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,270
weaving a weaving a team ever I in front
of the

90
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:27,640
from the motion detector things like
that you think about any of these

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,880
additional constraints

92
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,060
rate so for example how many users you
need to process is this area

93
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,990
what's your how fast is the to handle
that designed to handle different

94
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,020
not the people at different times you
need to have now what kinds of levels

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,310
access control you need

96
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,750
and you need to the system interface
with other things as a stand-alone

97
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,470
system

98
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,360
all these are the things are do
important things to consider while

99
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,500
choosing

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,750
well choosing and access control system

101
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,660
now in one case is

102
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,160
in all the cases you might be concerned
because it

103
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,680
a single a seal access control technique
in only can only improve the air

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,890
so much an inordinate is there is always
a trade-off between

105
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,610
the accident the arm the except read the
full production rate

106
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,610
but it is possible to

107
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,320
improve of these things pie stacking
multiple systems together

108
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,400
so the typical the typical security fine
for the people talk about his

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,820
are what you have was well you know one
person where you are

110
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,230
so I combining the different types of
medication you can improve both systems

111
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:35,350
but again sometimes introducing multiple
law North like this control techniques

112
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,380
can actually reduce its

113
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,680
for example if you only can call you
bypass on your

114
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,380
fancy fancy walk then

115
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,350
you introduce this extra you increase
the attack surface infused

116
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,400
your problems now all the systems are
centralized

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,700
you up to so in this introduces a whole

118
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,780
nother so problems because the bottom
line is that these

119
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:03,170
centralized access control systems these
neck stripe readers for Prague start in

120
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,180
some cases

121
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,760
are some is not smart cards these online
verification

122
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,510
and the the boil down to a system that
produces bit streams

123
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,940
rate and everyone your thing knows the
problems with you know shuffling

124
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,440
bit streams around buildings by the role
model to all those who love

125
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,260
communications line tapping you know you
have to worry about the secured the

126
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,200
server just worry about the security and
points yet worry about

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,540
all the other aspects love the system
that's other introduce me know this

128
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,450
online centralize checking

129
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:35,770
a in forever don't understand sorta in
more detail

130
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,919
what's happening with these you have to
go towards what the actual bus protocols

131
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,300
with the formats are

132
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,630
I and what he says you see you see
really

133
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,000
ability within these days some ours to
32-bit systems

134
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,010
source for you know 45 for other serial
protocols

135
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:54,099
are and when the most common though is

136
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,400
is the weekend but for a call alright

137
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,400
it's actually it's a somewhat
unfortunate naming convention put

138
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,710
you can people hear me when I'm gone I'm
talking here okay

139
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,919
a great thanks up

140
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,139
the weekend both protocol is plywood the
most common systems

141
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:14,410
its a very very simple but for a call
uses

142
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,830
two wires our dessert data one wire
today 20 wire

143
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,979
on a normal circumstances they both held
high

144
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,740
and in order send a one the the one
wears polo

145
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,850
and worsens your wires 0 20 hours

146
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,419
the Polo and that's all there is to the
weekend bus format is

147
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:36,389
very simple there's no there's no fancy
sorted in line Christian

148
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:39,698
a the goes into this I and

149
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:43,109
this is ordered a very very pervasive
theme

150
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,389
I'm on centralized access control

151
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:51,630
you know communication formats that very
is very very rarely any for love

152
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,850
encryption between the in point the card
reader

153
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,910
are the in the card reader and be

154
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,029
verification system um

155
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:04,410
and I guess less stuff can I think

156
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,019
guy believes this really fantastic
device

157
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:11,089
units a meeting form factor the disputes
completely in line

158
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,800
in a typical so weekend

159
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,579
in weekend wire and

160
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:22,279
can do interception in replay attacks
just in a very straightforward

161
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:26,750
manner and this is this is sorta still
pervasive problem because even the weed

162
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,200
new smart cards with on board
cryptographic models

163
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,650
a in your new going 5th 2012 in point
readers

164
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,939
you know this problem that these also
too fancy fancy authentication halfway

165
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,980
between your products for your smart
card in the reader

166
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,410
but then the dealer is just for being
shifts

167
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:49,920
in plain text and if you have your wires
going to drop ceiling

168
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,579
or through an easily accessible wall or
if you don't have a

169
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,740
if you don't have any sort Emperor
tamper detection on the reader itself

170
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,000
then this is a serious problem that some
people

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,700
bed tens be ignored on water cases

172
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,200
so now you talk a bit about some the
different different categories

173
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,810
I'll access control system so we're
gonna go through talking to be on the

174
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,630
cards

175
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,439
be stalking bay systems knowledge-based
systems and biometric systems

176
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,820
noting talk without terms to hear me

177
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,110
just testing 12 okay so thing about
guards sister

178
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,350
simple I mean it it's a guy sitting on a
counter with the radio to do not miss

179
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,060
hand

180
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,100
being like can I see your ID cuz your ID
cuz you are you can use your

181
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,600
I D this is all day long and you'll have
to remove the one line

182
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,570
and CPM is nine bucks an hour and we
hope he doesn't take any bribes on the

183
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,710
table in a good right

184
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,310
mean its nine bucks an hour or so easy
to setup doesn't cost very much for

185
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,150
first couple years but just keeping that
nine books in our

186
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,189
all the way out to leave the tires sixty
years later

187
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,000
which over about sixty years as you know
some very long time to remove to

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,680
a computer as robot which does the Kings
can I see your ID can I see your ID can

189
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,920
I see your ID and does nothing

190
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,790
donuts which I guess is you know less
money don't money

191
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,910
and the course John Martin is not
affected by the environment this means

192
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,730
that

193
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,820
gets cold outside and put on a down
jacket forgets hollow

194
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,690
gets hot outside the persona you know
blue Hawaiian shirt or whatever it is

195
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,930
I know a mesh cap as opposed to the the
wall one but

196
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:19,920
all in all you can you can drop the
garden to just about any environment as

197
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,209
long as he has no his

198
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,250
heater and his cable TV he's happy not
so much with a la Turk

199
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,460
the Lotto Max control systems the
problem with the guard is that

200
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,820
his second ideal day and he's looking at
these ID's day after day after day after

201
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,560
day

202
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,310
and he never sees a fake one which means
the reason counterfeit ID's

203
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,600
because the problem with the human mind
is we're for creatures of habit

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,140
so free see the same thing every day we
get used to saying okay okay okay okay

205
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,580
okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay

206
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,640
pretty soon we say that no matter what
happens and we're too busy thinking

207
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,270
about what's going on on the cake cable
channel and Anna Nicole Smith

208
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:03,410
and Nicole Smith China then whether or
not the ID the guy

209
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,819
if in the suit is actually holding up is
actually accurate

210
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,130
it could be you know that the that the
bad guy the attacker

211
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,870
got his hands on religious legit ID
stoltz pickpockets

212
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,760
and never got reported could be some
left already lying around

213
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,529
could be the guards doesn't care because
he's much more festive than a call Smith

214
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,750
and of course he's got a salary so

215
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,660
that's going to cost a lot over the 1020
sixty years that he's going to be in

216
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,149
service

217
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,089
now the its most significant problem
with guards is and I told you this

218
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,350
this have but you're Asian thing which
means that you know

219
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,990
even if you have a photo ID which is a
postmaster subject in yazoo whole

220
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,830
graphic and

221
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,300
super hard to counterfeit the girdle
relook

222
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,380
arm the story goes that there was a
military base some someone the gigantic

223
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,990
US Army system

224
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,990
were you know the debate the guy in
charge of security on the base was

225
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:02,620
you know says that the top himself the
whole system is really great up design

226
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,190
but

227
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:06,970
you I should probably check it just in
case because the Iranian for the Chinese

228
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,550
ur

229
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,830
the Indians or whoever it was that you
try to defend against

230
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,380
might try to get in and so he went went
down to the barn

231
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,880
where he met his buddies everyday any
you a couple guys who worked in

232
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,649
intelligence and figured he could trust
him

233
00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:22,770
so he was like you know tell you what
guys gonna try this experiment come to

234
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,959
my office tomorrow morning and get you
set up

235
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,200
and your next couple months you if you
guys managed to get into the base

236
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,310
about you guys all round two beers and
they're like hell yes

237
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,550
free beers really can get in they showed
up to his office the next morning and he

238
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,779
handed them each

239
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:41,230
set up new ID cards all-access which had
replaced their pictures with that

240
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,320
love your average African baboon

241
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,940
how do you figure you know them it might
last a week because the guys the front

242
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,450
or a little slow

243
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,510
but you know once the other ones they
change 01 sport with you

244
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,529
get the was the gets new donuts or
whatever but probably does her thing

245
00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:57,439
what new things in the park notice the

246
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,990
ID's took him two months

247
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,050
I'm the only reason the guard caught on

248
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,350
is because those intelligence guys were
intelligence guys and you're not like

249
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,200
cyprus people

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,270
actual dexterity and we're heading over
there I D the phone book cart

251
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,819
and drop to the ground the garbage down
picked it up and was like um

252
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,040
a yeah

253
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,050
so you know that the more scientific
version this is a study that was done at

254
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,970
the University Westminster

255
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,350
wheezing stock photo credit cards they
went to a supermarket

256
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,130
and asked the supermarket checkout
checkers

257
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,620
after-hours whose job it was to you know
to check ID's all day

258
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,180
see whether or not people are old enough
to buy alcohol was like okay we're gonna

259
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,720
send a whole bunch of college students
through

260
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,790
summer going to have real ID's from
Ardmore are going to have real ID's for

261
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,269
other people

262
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:52,470
some are going to have real ideas from
other people that are

263
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,610
completely different looking you know
like you know might cure has an ID from

264
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,399
some rust a ferry in dude from

265
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,060
subs are in Africa who who have poppers
and wearing the yellow and green captain

266
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,959
yellow red and green cap in the picture
and too long dreads

267
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,519
that kinda thing about the that this
consider they're really wrong ID

268
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:13,700
%ah overall there are eight was

269
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,120
30 2.6 percent

270
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,279
when the photo was blatantly wrong

271
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:27,570
their rate went up to 34 point zero
nine-percent

272
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,640
but fully half the cashiers were so
paranoid

273
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,370
that the rejected a recent and accurate
ID photo

274
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,370
326 336 cashiers would like be like I
this is fake

275
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,510
the godlike kodak's got that last week

276
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:51,490
and so overall about 50 percent in the
time the left through a fake ID

277
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,019
fifty percent of the time they also
rejected a real ID so

278
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:58,570
when it came down to it sixty-three
percent of the time

279
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:02,459
they accepted a fake ID with a more or
less good looking picture

280
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:09,160
not about who sixty percent of the time

281
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,199
this is in fact the statistics which I
forgot to click through to sorry

282
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,209
but now you can write them down scribble
them down memorize them

283
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,440
but having it 6-2 6-2 3.64 percent

284
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,170
I'm next up is Mike talking about tokens

285
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,430
now that you guys all realize that you
need a better system than that photo ID

286
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:30,779
card

287
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,720
yes so talkin talkin basis and just
systems based around

288
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
something that you carry around you
either either your key

289
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,170
your mag stripe magnetic are Park Road

290
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,610
to something something physical that you
have so first

291
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,070
mechanical you are everyone seemed easy
ones had these announcement too much

292
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,350
time on them because

293
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,019
and a pretty well covered in other talks
but you know the they do have a lot of

294
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,880
view real advantages you know they can
be made very reliable they don't need a

295
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,880
power supply

296
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,140
you know if you have to worry about you
know you'll have to worry about

297
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,899
batteries running out

298
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,148
no but on the other hand damian they
have no I did feel no

299
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,980
without without ex-royal it fights over
the track attached to that would

300
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,500
with extra love you know we are crispy
and they have

301
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,849
was a well-known security issues that
have been talked about

302
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:19,458
for in quite a while %um technique and
bumpin you can

303
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:23,189
code them in Nikki's within you can
impression he's for them

304
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,579
in you can even attack you and the
master key systems right

305
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,379
I A you not believe it was a great paper
out by while ago

306
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,630
her few years ago describing how to

307
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,630
take between Turkey and in Newry

308
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,059
9 essentially decode the master key from
our from the change key

309
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:45,389
I and there are a lot different
different to rekindle locks veggies

310
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,899
you can use for breaking news

311
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:51,940
there were different factors that you
can use for breaking the master key

312
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,419
system you even

313
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:56,769
even beyond just just

314
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:00,590
converting to change key today
disassemble the law can be towed

315
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,389
the match he serves on the master key
from the disassembly

316
00:18:04,389 --> 00:18:08,350
I and you know in some cases they will
do you have information but

317
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,879
even then if you love if you make some
educated guesses about the way the

318
00:18:11,879 --> 00:18:13,409
master key system was

319
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,669
was constructed you think you can get
pretty far pretty quickly towards the

320
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,230
actual Tarnowski

321
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,529
so they love the water problems that you
need to consider and you need to really

322
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:23,909
be careful about

323
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:27,029
who you're defending against right i'd

324
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:30,159
in while the case is you know if you
can't if you can't

325
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:34,499
make sure that no if you can prevent
someone from sitting in front but were

326
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:35,029
with her

327
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,980
with a screwdriver in life like for real
10-15 minutes

328
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,590
then you know you need to really think
about whether or not

329
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:46,720
the mechanical keys is going to be good
enough at all

330
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,759
there were different also known
mechanical lock technologies

331
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,919
in all those who love is will discuss no
other places in

332
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,049
goes into you know the lottery believe

333
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:02,809
yet to get the lockpick village they're
trying it they're hoping our running it

334
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,489
so this gets to a lot of other for more
interesting I think

335
00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:11,340
access control systems so for you want
wintry one bit you'd only see quite so

336
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,789
often is being card

337
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:16,090
user old mechanical key cards you see a
lot

338
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:21,039
in hotels I because they're very very
quick to reach even

339
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,570
up but the kind you to copy ok so the
way this works is that

340
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,939
they're all these the cards looks more
like that

341
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,559
in there are holes in them and

342
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:37,609
you can either read the mechanically or
optically and the readers for trucks

343
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,080
into the holes in the right place

344
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,600
now these things are perform at their
uses the car and is

345
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,629
one someone for his ring for tell
thieves that

346
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:49,679
had a they went around watching be

347
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,919
watching the custodians open doors and
indeed to live

348
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,019
go copy the key from you from from
observation

349
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,320
million then distilling steel saluting
the hotel rooms in this wasn't

350
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,189
not a great thing and is even worse
because the mechanical

351
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,259
box you have to think there's do these
things repressing down

352
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:13,629
on the card and it turns out that's
actually pretty easy it

353
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,779
killed I invoked you need to sort of put
some will sensors on our

354
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,009
on a sheet if and she'd card about that
size and measure the

355
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,200
mister the electrical resistance changed
change 1ba

356
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,639
when the movement when the pin in the
reader

357
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:32,019
comes down and detour to the card you
can make it

358
00:20:32,019 --> 00:20:36,639
very easily so these be done really well
very high security did not been not used

359
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:39,690
very of more you know there's I can
follows

360
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,070
legacy insulations but that's about it

361
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,480
10 most common ones though that you do
see a lot still our next trip starts:

362
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,899
no match for Kurds have you also been
talked about a lot nine other places

363
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:52,869
like it's an issue that I'm on them

364
00:20:52,869 --> 00:20:55,389
but this all the pretty fun things you
know they come in a couple different

365
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:58,460
varieties there's look or civilian
height or Citi Cards

366
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,830
coercivity system measurements above it
simply how much

367
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,100
magnetism and magnetic energy to take to

368
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,729
changement good search teams the cart to
to

369
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,080
due to polarization won the magnetic
domains in the car

370
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,299
Outlook or civilly cards you noticed to
your ballpark the years there

371
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:20,840
they take about three hundred Thursday's
first as the the unit

372
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,709
numbers refer to our city I to

373
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,779
to write and this turns out to be

374
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,059
a lot less than pretty much everything
else so

375
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:35,879
for example just refrigerator magnets
other high coercivity cards

376
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:40,749
all this stuff can you know I the rear a
dork corrupts

377
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:43,809
or less of a network card

378
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:47,149
Urlacher's a retard to the workers who
the car to go invade

379
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:50,460
with just to run the mill ferric oxide

380
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,210
hikers report on the other hand are made
from very empty right and are on the

381
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,350
order of three thousand

382
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,359
persistence so there you know the
saltwater magnitude more difficult to

383
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,199
to rewrite one of the reasons why your
high coercivity

384
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,570
writers are somewhat more expensive and
look for City Reuters

385
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,678
United actually those differences is so
bad high court records

386
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,279
10 you put the next to a looker City
carted Kenya

387
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:20,559
severely spam with data frequently now
there'll I will be on the nice to carry

388
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:20,940
around

389
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,759
there's sorta it's a plastic card to the
GeekWire ally was long as there aren't

390
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,330
any other magnificent

391
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,470
on it feels this is limited by the back
end so

392
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,729
can is nothing short appoint a lot we
can do

393
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:37,139
quite a bit if you want to they're cheap
but there's also travel to read

394
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,200
duplicate and potentially modified so

395
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,590
you know they're not really consider

396
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,399
high security solution anymore I don't
think I ivory anyone

397
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,499
so next record's released hyper city
tonight so card for relatively recent

398
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:52,159
invention

399
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,259
I am the the hikers to reformat wasn't
standardize and so

400
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,489
known late nights early 2008 thank a

401
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:04,600
and there was do problems with the phone
lookers a record was really well known

402
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,609
and they were need a solution to that
and so the solution uniform

403
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:12,199
love early custom barium ferrite firms
Google

404
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,320
you know that the typical traveled a lot
like I've been card but with

405
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,649
the whole replaced with will through the
piece is a very inferior

406
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:24,159
Union the magnets the magnetic fields
and being very would

407
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,859
usually with top tunes are could be
detected by Hall sensors are

408
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:31,220
something to that effect on the reader
to to do this and

409
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,659
the you had a lot of the things going
for them there quite tough there

410
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:39,049
very weather resistant there now

411
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,139
but they were very easy to decode the
from

412
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:46,869
as you to sort of had issued a paper
with magnets on there and so

413
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:51,369
you know iron filings among other things
would sort of give away the

414
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:56,109
giveaway little the again these these
uRS is mourns for love

415
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:59,639
RK film but me if I last seen on the
Department system

416
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,960
the middle nowhere so

417
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,049
Cinti the strangeloves interesting but
obsolete access control systems

418
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:11,200
I we can lawyers for all my favorite
sisters via

419
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,330
the technologies for love so so needs
even though they're not used anymore

420
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,840
so we can wire itself is a process
magnetic alloy

421
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,019
is basically a it's a wire with

422
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:27,399
that's been specially treated as the the
the core the wire

423
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,779
is soft news is being held intention and

424
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:34,149
the outer solar wire is in compression

425
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:37,289
can see the photo the illustration

426
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:40,749
and the this of course is low Corsetti
the whole report

427
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,419
is height or city and what you end up
with is this

428
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:47,629
single apparent magnetic domain wall
views

429
00:24:47,629 --> 00:24:51,019
to magnetic domains with just a single
domain wall

430
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:55,489
throughout the entire fuel water and
this gives you this really cool facts

431
00:24:55,489 --> 00:25:00,070
says that will so first willingly let go
from

432
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,769
when you total polarization a magnetic
to mean

433
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,149
in a an affair a magnet then their cause

434
00:25:07,149 --> 00:25:11,509
a for exchange a magnetic flux change
and if your book will your by

435
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:15,289
back to nil induced current and it will
induce turn in the quill

436
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,629
so agree way too just to through see
this happening

437
00:25:18,629 --> 00:25:23,080
to take here exec will wire with
attached to some speakers are

438
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,189
I so headphones put it next to

439
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:29,649
a piece %uh violin or another
ferromagnetic metal

440
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:33,989
and then take a magnet interweaving next
appeasement yogurt you'll hear stacked

441
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:39,289
and has been caused by the life watched
spy Fox changes caused your

442
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:43,109
when magnetic domain change player and

443
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:47,199
in a typical in a typical peace love
ferromagnetic material

444
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,590
this affects isn't that strong you'll
use your stat

445
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:55,080
but in a week in wire there's only one
domain so there's only one thing that's

446
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,879
changing polarity

447
00:25:56,879 --> 00:26:01,309
and this will we this with the weekend
where access control system is based on

448
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:05,168
so you'll have a

449
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:08,769
up

450
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:13,369
if anybody has any clue why occasionally
and MBD tries to connect to a random

451
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:14,399
computers on the Internet

452
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:21,399
international search please tell me I've
had been at his problem for years now

453
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:24,809
ok at so continuing

454
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:30,019
so we can worry card has two lines way
as a one line in the zero line

455
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:33,119
it's my dad's remind you that we can but
for a call

456
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,169
because it's all from the same place

457
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:40,009
it has a it is we can wire no 1 spot
bennett's

458
00:26:40,009 --> 00:26:43,179
Reza one it is that we can wire the
jurors pottery

459
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:46,409
0 and visa run through

460
00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:50,249
a couple different magnets so first is
one over 17 Agnes the set for its

461
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:54,320
all the although we can wires in one
polarity

462
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,840
then it resets them in the in Sonamarg
was right next to the read head

463
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,379
and then it's just a made up for Twitter
and this gives you this

464
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:06,710
nice single big Netflix change with
figures

465
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:09,759
which induces a you nice balls and
current

466
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,759
and the reheat its and thats

467
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:17,379
decoded as the as a as a code on the
weekend card

468
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:20,470
and you'll see these there's one sort of
historical

469
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:23,899
coincidence to the weekend bust for a
call he related to this

470
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:27,659
his if you'll notice busy leaving
preventing you from just

471
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,869
taking the upward on wall street from
the read head calling one of those the

472
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:31,330
data

473
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,678
data one wired was the data 0 wire and

474
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,109
and is running that three tier access
control system so the fact that weird

475
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:39,759
using

476
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:43,429
this weekend but for a call in smart
card readers &

477
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,769
fostered leaders as Aldous or to the
side effects love this one

478
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:51,879
the physical physical phenomenon

479
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:57,239
to the photo above a weak and tired we
can actually see the 10 week in wires

480
00:27:57,239 --> 00:28:01,460
this is a magnetic negative film on top
so the way this was taking was

481
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,169
but not going to come on top we will
with a magnet across it

482
00:28:05,169 --> 00:28:08,720
news the Fox change and then that shows
up on film

483
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,489
take for that so 10 breaks and we can
wear cards

484
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:16,629
so the first attack on these things was
released in 96 on the site for punks

485
00:28:16,629 --> 00:28:17,559
list

486
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,149
and so 11 other one the problems with
the lawyers that you can't buy

487
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:26,809
so you can buy in bulk wine it is is not
only possible if you need if you needed

488
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,309
we need to go find a specialty magnetic
materials please and hadn't gotten rid

489
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:31,479
of it for you

490
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:34,969
but there's there's a lot of good
sources love

491
00:28:34,969 --> 00:28:39,090
absolve we can wires and just just the
right quantity in just the right size

492
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,249
and shape

493
00:28:40,249 --> 00:28:43,789
for we wear card just other we can worry
carts

494
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,190
so there's a leaping prevents you from
this cutting 10 pins were rearranging

495
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,629
the wires and

496
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:53,499
using that the queen bee stings as you
saw in the last photo

497
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:57,509
and they're they're pretty easy to
decode and it's even worse in person

498
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:01,429
you to school when these appropriately
then you can very clearly see where the

499
00:29:01,429 --> 00:29:03,029
lawyers are

500
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:07,159
in additionally if you're not willing to
actually do this

501
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:10,919
you don't want these things also owns
and leases signed attacks

502
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:14,669
since it's not like this beaters
actually detect in the week in wire

503
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,849
its detecting a magnetic flux change

504
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:22,619
which is very easy to to simply with AR
with the song

505
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,899
is moving on to bartered spark whose I
don't think that interest in person

506
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,419
dirty pillows security

507
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,820
someone into the virgins their uses
duplicate

508
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,080
arm they're probably for some things but

509
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,139
not for most things there've been some
attempts at making search easy invisible

510
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:40,269
barcodes

511
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:43,639
where you cover the Burke good no I
arsenic

512
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:46,979
or using you residents and things like
that know what's really

513
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:51,080
contribute to security much so fraught
an RFID

514
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,779
for dinner for the was a well known as
you know they re

515
00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:58,200
becoming more and more pervasive and
they're more more common

516
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,629
and this is sorrel wanna be a one luv

517
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:04,899
probably the next next generation OSV
accident or what

518
00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:09,119
what most people deploying these days
the low on issues including them

519
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,549
if in fact them units it's another thing
that's been talked about more than once

520
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:13,879
the stock

521
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:17,919
a one of the things i think is
interesting to talk about though

522
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,639
is how the RFID systems are integrated
with existing legacy systems

523
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:26,960
because this is another one of those we
love system borders where you get

524
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,019
interesting woman towards so many things
at MIT for example

525
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,859
the introduced in RFID system with a

526
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,090
there was on the seem

527
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:41,989
next we'll probably have before and it
turned out that there's actually a clear

528
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:43,519
mapping between

529
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,809
the RFID the for talk numbers and the

530
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:50,029
things included on the next right and
this meant that

531
00:30:50,029 --> 00:30:54,759
by sniffing your by by sniffing in RFID

532
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,460
you could actually clone the next right
to

533
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:01,669
and you want you I think maybe

534
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:05,450
maybe this isn't a problem on its you
can clean the RFID then there's already

535
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,639
enough a problem

536
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,639
but it turns out that the next trip is
what's used

537
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:15,099
to control say your campus campus month
for food for example

538
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:19,789
so know someone's walking around you
know

539
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:23,259
sniffs your car in clones that can

540
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:27,389
axis your food money as well

541
00:31:27,389 --> 00:31:30,719
not here I should note that after the
paper was released

542
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:35,759
there was leaning towards earlier some
months maybe years after MIT

543
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,219
got a clue and up to do their system gay
full disclosure

544
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:42,559
yeah so it's a yet related

545
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,289
so not everyone is happy about about our
fight is at MIT in

546
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:50,019
in particular song wasn't wasn't real
happy about it

547
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:54,129
uses RFID the it automatically spoofs 1
I've

548
00:31:54,129 --> 00:32:00,219
several several of his coworkers are
ladies

549
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:03,629
so fraudsters are great but they'd the
kind who limited

550
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:06,729
I mean there's there's only so much you
can do on the most of them are

551
00:32:06,729 --> 00:32:09,849
pretty much done memory devices summers
murder but

552
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,799
really relief you looking for I security

553
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,489
you know you want you want a
cryptographic protocol to talk to you

554
00:32:16,489 --> 00:32:18,389
and with the CPU tokens

555
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:22,359
at a smart cards are I buttons this is a
photograph I but your

556
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,279
I other problem was just no it's
essentially a smart card

557
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:29,839
in a button format she expects

558
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,940
the other someone someone decided they
didn't really want to

559
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,139
put cards on a keyring so you end up
with you too with diamonds

560
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:41,589
to do that own you know these these
these Miller cool

561
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:44,749
it you know it can be easy to make for a
virtual token

562
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:48,379
just by by emulating that with other
electronics today

563
00:32:48,379 --> 00:32:51,869
problem um and again you know sometimes

564
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:56,549
cryptographic authentication be use
isn't is in such good crypto grief

565
00:32:56,549 --> 00:33:00,389
in that for you love the single single
key things to worry about here

566
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:03,919
I you also need to worry about power
else's DirecTV

567
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,929
spence spent yawns fighting hacks
prevent them from falling near

568
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:13,369
concluding their cards using no
different with her analysis in August

569
00:33:13,369 --> 00:33:16,539
and in those techniques a

570
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:20,089
but again won that one other more
important issues when trying to

571
00:33:20,089 --> 00:33:21,408
integrate these witnesses

572
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:26,080
in agree this in an existing system is
to worry about for all the

573
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,830
what's going on behind the scenes so you
have a this crazy cryptographic

574
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:32,729
authentication protocols using you know

575
00:33:32,729 --> 00:33:36,139
real we'll take the snow yet a
certificate home in something between

576
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,349
between you see if you took in the
reader

577
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,109
you to make sure that that's likely
forget it all the way back to the

578
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:45,309
to the actual access control panel

579
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:48,950
okay now it's going to talk a bit about
North systems

580
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,469
their use others say these others a
fracking talk call I mean I don't you

581
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:53,799
guys roll their eyes

582
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:57,479
a though those tastes are one of the
oldest

583
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:01,179
know that's based access control systems
because we've got a dial the front

584
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:04,899
I need to know the combination to get in
safe

585
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:08,750
the sole use today in many cases for
even physical access control they've

586
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:12,139
the government uses physical safe locks
on some doors

587
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:15,409
arm but more common these days is course
electronic keypads

588
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,820
and safe type electronic lock switch are
a tropical

589
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:22,169
locks that are designed for use on safes

590
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:27,040
added up the two doors or electronic
locks look like they flock some again

591
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,089
can be used indoors or on vaults

592
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:33,119
I mechanic combination locks

593
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,230
threes one unique type that is doesn't

594
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,070
come from a safe world that's a simplex
lock you guys have all seen the summer

595
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:40,960
you guys

596
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,770
you know may have looked online how do I
pick them with the instructions been

597
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:45,739
like her

598
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,820
I'm going to brute-force everything you
know the twenty-something article on

599
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,990
going through all the possible
combinations which really isn't very

600
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:52,119
money

601
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,909
arm the reason they're used is ther

602
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:59,349
pretty simple their mechanical devices
they don't need me power

603
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,300
ever-reliable some pretty simple
mechanism

604
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,830
eased understand from the perspective of
that the poor guy making your nine bucks

605
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,390
an hour

606
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:10,670
quest to go to the combination every
time

607
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,160
unfortunately they don't have any audit
trail so you can't tell who came in

608
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,319
you can't tell if last guy that came in
was no your coworker next to you

609
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,740
and that's why you know your TV's gonna
your computer screen is gone because he

610
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,770
wanted the 30-inch

611
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,650
back home to watch you Unreal Tournament
plea ure tournament on

612
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:30,500
I you can manipulate them even if the

613
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:33,500
construction Robert very clear and of
course there

614
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,050
quite easy to brute force there aren't
that many combinations

615
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,890
you go in the weapon finalist sit there
for 10 minutes with your chair

616
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,759
maybe some music playing in your iPod
and go through all possible numbers

617
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,040
and open that FedEx boxer you know
whatever is the B&A

618
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,570
that that down the strip steel door two
guards outside during the day

619
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,070
to understand how we met up with these
locks

620
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,450
Osher see if I can get these guys here

621
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:08,299
area this should be posted on the web

622
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,920
arm all have it on security got a ritual
that com

623
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,310
security dot eric's middle dot com

624
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:18,940
bug me afterwards when the hospital my
last name

625
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:25,940
if you google me you're probably fines

626
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:33,799
anyway so how these things work well you
you into a combination and you turn the

627
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,670
handle the open

628
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:38,470
real simple how the how that works is
you have

629
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:43,230
its it's like a safe lock you have a
Sears buttons

630
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,810
thats are connected via gears to a
series of rotating tumblers

631
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:52,299
and instead of having the mall on one
single spindle and having a fence

632
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
the drops in you have a linear fence

633
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,270
this is with that black metal thing on
the bottom with a couple fingers spoken

634
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,740
out about

635
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,089
5 fingers in fact that have to all drop
in

636
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:08,540
two slots in five of those five tumblers
and if you look

637
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,230
you'll see that there's a couple love
tumblers which are aligned

638
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,540
those would be the the rights to the
left

639
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,089
3 aren't aligned and those fingers
couldn't slide in

640
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:23,720
even if they wanted to when you enter
the combination

641
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,230
and you can see this year in the video
you

642
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:33,260
advance the time were by one that is the
time with link to the key

643
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,579
when you press any button after that

644
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:40,750
not only do you advance the number that
is linked to the bottom you just pushed

645
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:44,130
but you also advanced the previous
numbers that you

646
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,930
already pushed this is how each from
were has five different positions even

647
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,589
though you can only prestige q What's

648
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:53,940
because if you press the one key in the
two key in three key

649
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,780
first to advance the time when number
one then you dress

650
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,359
number number two and one because he was
pressed to the new address

651
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:05,520
number number three and then advance
again numbers 1-2

652
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,430
the South kinda complicated but
basically means that

653
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,180
tumbler one can go all the way with

654
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:18,060
this number five but if its the last
number the combination coli

655
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:21,400
Street be at this number one or not be
used all of the other number the

656
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,800
combination is also the locks know
whether you to the commission the right

657
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,150
way

658
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,750
right where all right way or the wrong
way should want to trees with 321

659
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,869
to make sense in a sec trust me

660
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:36,599
so if you wanna pick it just like the
law

661
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:40,940
its overt figure which ones are binding
if you look at the video I wanna play

662
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,060
this against you can see it

663
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:48,150
really because the screens we too small
for the video you'll see that

664
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,030
as I apply a bit of torque to handle the
lock

665
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,290
and then Prof on all the buttons

666
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,310
the first time was binding and the rest

667
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,349
art thing about these locks

668
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:05,040
normal you crank the handle if you have
the combination it goes all the way it

669
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,829
looked orders nope

670
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:09,319
but there's this one place

671
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:12,770
you term handle this has been a response

672
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,800
amid keeps going you stop better
resistance

673
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,980
you have trigger the little clutch that
says hoops no combination entered a

674
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,109
wrong combination entered

675
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:26,359
just got to keep going I've been open
the door if you stop

676
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,480
don't trigger that clutch you'll
actually but be applying

677
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,190
torque attention to the intro mechanism
we've got to get information with the

678
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,630
lock

679
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,000
so to figure which numbers a binding
term the handles

680
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,250
until you feel resistance and then just
keep applying force

681
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,250
without going too far just practice
takes more

682
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,579
30 seconds to burn and you go through

683
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:50,849
and you look at all the time boers and
you see that in this case

684
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,020
the first tumblers binding because the
that what

685
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,960
isn't pushing as far down but the rest
the buttons are going so beautifully

686
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,770
further down

687
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:02,589
because those tumblers are moving around
freely because what's your

688
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:06,040
pushing on that fence those tumblers

689
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,599
the toll is binding can't move because
its blitzes

690
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,420
destruction there the tempers are free
to go or wherever the hell they want to

691
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,440
because the French fences and touching
them yet because there's mechanical

692
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,460
imperfections lock

693
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:22,550
as with any lock that's how we pick all
them so we know the first timers by the

694
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,609
what the heck's we do now

695
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:26,680
we pushed the first number

696
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,819
and we figure out is are any other
tumors binding

697
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:35,160
because once the first time were pushed
you've now advance that

698
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,629
real one position I'm the question is

699
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:43,589
is the gate in that we'll now under the
finger in the fence

700
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:50,200
allowing you to buy the different number
the thing is

701
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,420
here's the thing if another timbres
binding

702
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,380
and as the work gets really cerebral if
another timers binding

703
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,619
the logical thing to do is to push that
second number

704
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:08,440
because what's happened is if by pushing
one

705
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,960
we put that first time were right
position pushing other buttons gonna

706
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,510
throw over the or whack at that first
time was gonna go back into our own

707
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,160
positions can go too far

708
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,549
we want to make sure that first number
from now on is always in the pool in the

709
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:23,730
right position which happens to be

710
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:27,170
in position one

711
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,310
in this case however

712
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:34,759
after pushing one we didn't fight
anymore biding time verse that is

713
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,280
all the other Penske truck pushing all
had about the same motive sloppiness

714
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,740
and words hard work resisting at all
like timber number one was

715
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:46,180
which means we know something else about
the lock we know that

716
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,990
somewhere one is not supposed to be in
position one because

717
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,020
ones who got to position one no other
tumblers freed up

718
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,259
or no was just nor the timer for binding

719
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,250
so weak address another position what we
do is we push

720
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,460
throw away but in this case I pushed 5

721
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,700
and we see if if any more tumors abiding

722
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,069
by pushing 5 we've advanced old number
one

723
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,180
to the second position an hour gonna see
if

724
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,200
it's in the right position because
another pins by direct route for you get

725
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,490
with the

726
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:26,490
we'll talk with your doctor should
concentrate

727
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:35,380
and so we check for binding because
there wasn't any binding

728
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,760
after pushing for this was to address to
where we're number 12 get another

729
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,330
position

730
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:45,630
and we find the total number two was by

731
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:49,150
which means that tumbler number one

732
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,300
because we have to push two buttons
after pushing one

733
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,440
to get to a number one right position we
do it Tom we're number one

734
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,970
is three numbers

735
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:06,050
before the end to the combination so
good how the combination 152

736
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,060
advance see if

737
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,740
any time was a binding because now we
have Tom

738
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,380
Tom Burnham wanna purpose which we know
is right ever conceive if timber number

739
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,030
two

740
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:20,540
know the right position reset the lock

741
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:27,540
and since that didn't work try 125

742
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,700
and see if any more tumors a binding
because almost see if we put any more

743
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,700
tumors in the right position this point
we would go back to reset lock

744
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:45,920
Gary no time for some time been a
problem for what it's supposed to be the

745
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,400
for

746
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,440
three positions with me in the
combination try 123

747
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,760
and the lock opens this is

748
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,140
something that's a bit hard to
understand even looking at the video

749
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,450
I how many I's gots got it yes I think I
was 30 for the room

750
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,920
yeah if you go online designed as a text
file called

751
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,170
I am The Hobbit skied a simplex locks
and that explains this

752
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:15,190
in written form to conserve the law
could do that home and learn how to do

753
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:15,480
it

754
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:18,750
The Hobbit

755
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,980
this that's the guys name name

756
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:25,869
to stop it no just OK to stop it are you
him

757
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:30,020
okay are you him

758
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:36,609
okay out about simplex locks

759
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:40,490
The Hobbit

760
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:43,490
as in water the Rings all that your

761
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:48,190
anyway since I'm I'm gonna go real fast
as a run like hell no not enough time

762
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:48,640
your

763
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,779
are electronic keypad to think you see
all the pictures you combination door

764
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:53,900
open bar being your good

765
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,060
how do you break them well used to be
you could look at fingerprints

766
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,710
or you could just with you the power and
we told a guy comes back comes back into

767
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:02,300
the combination come back after him

768
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,640
fun you've offered look at which button
is pushed and trial the possible

769
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,750
permutations of buttons

770
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:10,850
great particular week things locking you
out so you the highlighter

771
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,230
turns out that highlighter ink is
tracked from P to keep because it's

772
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,619
sticky

773
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,480
and doesn't really are dry dry properly
go see the hidden camera for real texas

774
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:19,930
ticket

775
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,410
how to treat works is well Louis keep I
was wrong with it

776
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:29,020
you know if you look really closely with
project doesn't show you were

777
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:32,800
maybe some kids double the number one
cue the Highlander don't know I later

778
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,560
but Park yet through through ducts or
I'll but anyways how it doesn't look

779
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,640
like a burglary attempt

780
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,910
doesn't look like I'm try to get in but
under UV light you can see

781
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:45,049
evidence what happens is art

782
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,540
nine dollar-an-hour guard comes in to
work in the morning he enters his

783
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,430
combination

784
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,319
you come in after him with your YouTube
UV light again are you see that for on

785
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,359
the word from the number 12

786
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,869
number to keep his tracks the
highlighter Inc you know that's the

787
00:45:56,869 --> 00:45:59,000
combination now contains sequence 12

788
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,520
so you come back the next day you put
highlighter ink

789
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,140
on the number two key I defied that he's
tracked it but actually the number three

790
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:06,460
key

791
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:09,740
you wash rinse repeat and find out that
pretty soon

792
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,880
the combination is 1234 because

793
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,580
after putting hollering on the fifty
just to be sure it never got tracked

794
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,080
anywhere

795
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,529
but I beg you don't have to sit there
all day for a week

796
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:24,340
I get caught you to come back to their
second ya later UV pen

797
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,890
immediate clearest wipe it off I

798
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:32,299
other way to do it use cameras hidden
cameras i watch Tiger Team they do a

799
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,240
great job with this

800
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,960
I the cameras to the keypad what's the
code entry Washington who promotes green

801
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,550
come in and buy to bring your in

802
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,490
solution to all this is the scramble
keypad just the donut

803
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,430
dynamically changing keypad which fixes
most these problems because the keys

804
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,490
chains round

805
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,920
I like Alice in Wonderland will LED
things

806
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,270
everything it scrambled over time the
combination centered however users

807
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,980
cancel

808
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,950
tell a friend I'm safe trip was trying
to talk the talk about these and safe

809
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:00,770
cracking talk

810
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:04,250
basically the rooster this is the XO it
I believe

811
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:07,550
I am the whole thing is that if you gone
on a trail

812
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:10,650
these are usually you either got a
dialogue a more they've got

813
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:13,920
keypad which or civil but the key
Patrick I

814
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,970
usually an audit trail this Lagarde
navigator was kinda cool because it's a

815
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:18,760
cell phone

816
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,980
safe lock which means that your sphere
safe is protected by

817
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,220
the self cellular phone at work which
means you got a great

818
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,290
on a trail you can see in real time was
going in coming

819
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:31,420
leaving your safe you can give them
access to deny them access

820
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,930
but well it's connected to cellular
phone network and the interwebs

821
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:38,160
which means that there's all sorts of
guys out there probably on 4chan we try

822
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,190
to get into your ATM

823
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,800
I'm course lot a safe calls

824
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,960
lot of a flexible to spike in which
means going the whole

825
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:50,230
or just fine point the wires and
applying voltage the right place others

826
00:47:50,230 --> 00:47:53,240
tricks like that you've got by metrics
for two months see if I can get to

827
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:54,430
before the cut me off

828
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,200
but about to talk really fast got voice
faith

829
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,680
you pretend you would read the scanner
scan signature was pattern recognition

830
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,790
this is you know my voice my path for
you walk up a new look like James Bond

831
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:08,240
his defeat because well you got a tip
for dinner %ah

832
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,510
face recognition well turns up you can
hold up a photo /url 40

833
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,730
or your laptop if the thing with my
checks the laptop

834
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,339
playing video of the guy the few films
with your to a dollar

835
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:22,259
HD you super consumer records for
whatever camcorder was walking down the

836
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:22,690
street

837
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:25,900
will let you in in his place
fingerprints well

838
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,480
your fingerprint leave behind
fingerprint sensors I'll take advantage

839
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,140
that by using gummy bears breath

840
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,270
wonderful bags like condoms popped out
the sensor

841
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,550
and in many cases that work is presumed
dead

842
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:40,310
with the damn thing worth of I nowadays
they try to fix that because everybody

843
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,180
knows about it by using swype advancers

844
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,250
you can still force pick up fingerprints
photograph them

845
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,550
have met from the PCB's then bowled your
own fingerprints

846
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:51,570
kinda cool army environment that's
repressed fingerprints

847
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,950
so the trick is of course to have a
train guard this doesn't help if the guy

848
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:58,080
if the attacker is using a fingerprint
attached to his finger

849
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,480
using something like elmer's glue a
multispectral imaging is a trick

850
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,320
was invented by some crazy people I
comical doing I'm

851
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,510
the whole idea is that it uses different
wavelengths which go through the skin

852
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,560
and therefore read out the blood vessels
as well as the sir

853
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,740
the fingerprint on the surface which
means it will in theory look through the

854
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,680
Elmer's Glue

855
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,980
see the movie fingerprint there'd be
like 10

856
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,339
I they claim it can do all these great
things nobody's actor tested it

857
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:29,890
I in theory it is out works different
wavelengths obstruction for driven

858
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,350
through to go through the skin

859
00:49:31,350 --> 00:49:34,680
so they use those as well visible
wavelengths

860
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,730
altogether the computer and so your
finger look like that

861
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,119
you think within show on it like
overflew looks like that which looks way

862
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,800
different than a regular fingerprint

863
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,160
and diffusing totally fake thing for
like one unit of gummy bear

864
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,529
or gel or whatever its good looks

865
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:53,230
nothing at all like a lie finger in
theory

866
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:56,540
arm hand geometry is kinda cool system
see the matter you human airports all

867
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,089
the time

868
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:00,490
put the put your heads the plate and and
think get open this looks like from Han

869
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,640
scatter

870
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,650
castro in hand money could buy cue from
the web

871
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:09,740
I redness Kenobi is no be there were
falsified arete not publicly

872
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:13,710
some CIA guys probably have but really
invested gotta get you I really close to

873
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:16,369
the scanner and take a free class that
everybody has to do it

874
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:19,589
are scatters the simple were simpler

875
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:23,330
less intrusive way camera takes picture
really low error rate

876
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,420
really really really really low air raid
in fact

877
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,650
the problem is your average magazine
cover letter president bush

878
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:32,859
has enough resolution to fully iris
scanner for you

879
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:36,060
go up to the nuclear bunker with your
cover time magazine to be like

880
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,900
sure president bush every other nuclear
launch codes please

881
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,609
I'll because the preferred contact
lenses custom contact anybody

882
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:46,900
singers recognition the divorce forged
signature

883
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:53,710
and I've been told to stop which it's
great because I'm doc

884
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:59,670
think

885
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:06,670
up are many questions before they kick
me out

886
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,390
up

887
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:14,499
thank you up

888
00:51:14,499 --> 00:51:21,499
well as long as one person learned up

889
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:26,949
hmm like part

890
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:27,759
fifth
