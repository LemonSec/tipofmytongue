1
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,660
testing

2
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,970
okay there we go alright

3
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,830
okay hi I'm black ration archer talk
about ghetto ideas and honey pots for

4
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,559
the home user

5
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,650
which no ghetto is just sort of a term I
decided to

6
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,970
really toss in there cuz its not
anything profession or not gonna be

7
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,150
deploying top player in our homeland but

8
00:00:54,150 --> 00:01:00,330
up anyway I like this is my favorite
xkcd comic is printed on my cube at work

9
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,910
arm and I just love to have this where
they have all the Cano

10
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:06,750
have giant virtual land of Windows
machines you can tell them how the

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,510
Institute on how they get infected

12
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,690
at a lot very Hollywood but yet never
gonna happen and technically I can't

13
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,810
tell you how to do here so

14
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,100
let's go move on I worry when are we
going to talk about

15
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,240
a what exactly happens on the end of
your Internet connection

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,729
open source tools that will set up your
own honey pot and ideas and how to tie

17
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:27,210
them together so you can actually tell
what the heck's going on

18
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,170
and I'll what you will likely see and
how it what it means and how to respond

19
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,530
who might just another phone free from
Boston

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,369
talked about number six tough guy on
other conferences I've been using these

21
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,050
tools

22
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:43,390
in since about 2002 herself home first
time I got exposed room was a cash

23
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,330
inflow I contest so they are
battle-tested

24
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,350
RG CIA so obviously these letters no

25
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,509
mean that I know more than all you arm

26
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,100
really nice guy talk Europe of the
things you do need alcoholic beverages

27
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,460
doing

28
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,190
I why am I using PowerPoint you saw that
I was using PowerPoint last year

29
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,789
on like two years ago at last hope I
decided to be cool use Linux use

30
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:05,780
OpenOffice open source is wonderful

31
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,100
lookin right before my presentation
would actually work with the projector

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,420
so I don't want exposed again so I
bought the book bit the bullet and

33
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,470
decided to use Windows

34
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,780
anyway let's go actually get to the
media subject

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,380
this is your internet connection is what
everyone thinks it is information

36
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,560
superhighway

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,650
you know all these little flags down
here showing all the different countries

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,360
you can get to

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,300
and you know you get your height weight
and it's fast it's wonderful you know no

40
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,349
ones on it you're gonna go

41
00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:35,530
scream through and get all these for
replaces this is what your reality is

42
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:42,280
you realize how hard it is to go search
on Google Images for right pictures does

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,150
not dislike

44
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,170
3 even and they just keep on showing up
on my phone this on Flickr

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,170
no Korea Commons no attribution some are
used in

46
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,090
arm we won actually trap these people
trying to smash in our information

47
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,430
superhighway internet blog

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,600
are so they're actually going to use
honey pots

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,360
no what exactly is a honeypot a honey
pot is the system

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,390
that while you're actually trying to
convince the attackers as high

51
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,560
no high-value you know full shock
wonderful information so street numbers

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,310
credit card numbers all kinds of
wonderful things

53
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,640
arm it's horribly secure device but in
reality it's something that you aren't

54
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,910
watching like a hawk

55
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:22,410
and monitor your every move that they
try to make are

56
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,370
the first time that I actually really
ever read into this and I think it's a

57
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,090
first hi

58
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,890
release of her i've seen reference
couple times D first real honey pot

59
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,170
was on an evening with Burford with our
bill chose week

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,140
and both three other authors he was the
AT&T

61
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,520
internet connection back in community
internet connection back in 1991

62
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,180
and he got attacked any sort of me

63
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,430
on Israel system he set up a fake system
so this attack could log in

64
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,700
and the trees come all the way back down
to I dunno

65
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,820
Norway another one somewhere along there
are really fun story it's our publics

66
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,370
the

67
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,160
available on the Internet and also it's
all part of his practical

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,960
firewalls I believe it's called arm

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,520
there are two main types of honeypots
high interaction and low interaction

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,120
high interaction is what you probably
are all expecting honey pot to be you

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,410
know

72
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,789
real actual system that you're plugging
and unplugging on the Internet

73
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:22,520
be it physical virtualized arm and now
the issue with hype Traxx honey pot with

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,310
the real computer plugged in Unity
Connection

75
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,330
obviously it's going to get hacked cuz
all if it doesn't act which on Yahoo

76
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,150
your ISP is

77
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,030
arm and it's with a real computer can
capture

78
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,449
actually gonna run to real threats in
more problems as and because when this

79
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,979
person actually chance to

80
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:42,139
attack your computer and compromise that
he's actually going to probably do

81
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:45,590
something bad with it that you don't
want to happen on your connection

82
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,310
you want to be in charge them arm the
other tables were injured

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,490
well honey pot is alone traction honey
pot are

84
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,139
there are two main ones that I data are
in use today once called the Panthers

85
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,370
and probably mispronouncing

86
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:02,270
exits some mmm the pen V's okay thank
you

87
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,430
arm gone after toma course that's

88
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,070
are or of another thing called honey
what it is this a provides an attacker

89
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,110
with what I call a movie set computer

90
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,240
are you you think your you know you look
at all the things you lots in hollywood

91
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,010
wherever

92
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,170
in its you know Main Street USA here
it's you know some

93
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,970
France French village and you look at it
looks great from the front but if you

94
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,980
actually pure on behind us actually
nothing behind

95
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,840
are actually another thing that I came
up with well obviously cover

96
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,400
presentation it's unlike Windows
non-player characters from

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,410
Final Fantasy one where you say two or
three things too and that's about it

98
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,470
no i'm looking for. might dog arm

99
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,930
with the fake computer arts not actually
going to be compromiser

100
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,480
hopefully on are therefore it's less
threatened was problems are not actually

101
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,840
going to be hosting all these

102
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,370
poor you mean ask your Wii things in
attacking other computers

103
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,919
are my infraction honey pot you really
don't want to be running these

104
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:58,229
arm you can if you want to unlock until
you can't but

105
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,250
its all on headaches and you have to be

106
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,830
on top at all times are you can
basically use real computer

107
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,729
or a physical virtual computer with
actual vulnerabilities be a VM

108
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,500
gon run on top a VMware even when the
top is n user mode Linux or if you want

109
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,930
just you know finder

110
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,850
old you know pentium 266 and toss it on
your internet connection there

111
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,360
argues that real problems attackers can
and will use your honey pot to attack

112
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,910
other systems because

113
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,030
normally what you see is you see someone
coming in are

114
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,760
breaking into your computer dropping his
little you know botnet client you know

115
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,560
do you ask why it something else

116
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,660
and then giving a community skin from
honey from

117
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,500
skin for the computers be honey pot you
know on arm

118
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,480
news program out there called snort in
line which uses IP

119
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,060
FW IP tables and stuff and snort to you

120
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,430
are see okay I have outbound traffic
okay is a dammed

121
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,440
yes okay I'm not going to send is it not
bad no

122
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,320
okay I can send are with that allow with
the attacker to do

123
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,940
is you know grabs toolkit route you know
do whatever he actually wants to

124
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,980
to your box but not actually go out to
the Internet attack other boxes

125
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,010
are it will protect you however it is
snorted signature base units not gone in

126
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,940
less you keep really on top of you with
all your latest I'll

127
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,060
IDS definitions you are going to you
know you may have something that speaks

128
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,990
through

129
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,300
are you always seem to keep on top of it
and

130
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,690
as we always say a lot of risk but what
civil war because with an age group

131
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:31,199
actual computer with people downloading
stuff to an attacking other systems you

132
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,530
are going to get the best picture
available

133
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:37,120
of what these people are doing to
computers out on the fam

134
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,690
and you can doom you know if you want to
see if you want to research into that

135
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:43,590
this is exactly what you want to do

136
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,070
arlo attracted many parts like I said
the refit computer generation

137
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,550
move device Corey physical the virtual
device that's moose vulnerabilities

138
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,050
arm less very much less of an attack
profile

139
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,010
it's not actually a real computer in so
it's only kind of shaking a

140
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,740
real computer without real with feet
will release on

141
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,430
arm less of a threat however you're
really going to start running into you

142
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,910
issues when they start attacking you
trying to get predicted response of it

143
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,510
and if the start seeing

144
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,490
hey you know this is not exactly
responding the way I expected you

145
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,810
they're gonna think it's a busted system
and are not going to take any more

146
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,130
or they're going to start you know
looking at a closer in

147
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,590
you gonna they're gonna find out you
know jigsaw arm

148
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:30,220
nuns realistic a tiny fraction like I
said but it will save you many headaches

149
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:33,300
if I was actually running this running a
high interaction any part of my internet

150
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,440
connection

151
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,029
I have to probably you know re wipe it
and reinstall it

152
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:42,328
every week at least are it will save you
many headache from doing that with low

153
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:44,149
international honey pot because

154
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:48,970
you won't have to doing that cuz
hopefully will never get compromised

155
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,050
so let's talk about how interaction
honeypots as I think this a slight

156
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,769
actually over thing

157
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:57,740
'em I how high interaction honeypots
worse we have our evil attacker you can

158
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,850
tell he was wearing an eyepatch

159
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,980
and he was attacking honey pot server
now honey bun service real computer

160
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,560
and he's going to compromise and do evil
things to it

161
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,260
well what he doesn't know and hope we
won't find out is that it's actually

162
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,860
really

163
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,980
everything he's doing over to monitoring
server now

164
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,330
does montre certainly doing like no it
can be running snored during an IDS

165
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:23,029
to be running you know all kinds have
things that whilst if Pakatan track them

166
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,040
however if for example he sets up secure
shown surfing infection that's going to

167
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,010
really start to become an issue because
you won't you'll see exactly what he's

168
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:30,790
doing

169
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,800
much you start doing forensic on the box
there are there's program out there

170
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
called

171
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,810
awesome back sebe K are life

172
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,470
people who frequent website is weather
will allow you to do is it will allow

173
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,290
you to monitor

174
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,449
it'll lockheed would allow you to see
exactly what he's doing at the console

175
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,589
replay back

176
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,270
as if you're staring at which is what
don't you do right is doing

177
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,660
are set up you make choices are Linux
and Windows because ninety percent what

178
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,020
people are going to optimize

179
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,120
are the studio offering systems

180
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,580
are winik's you'll see a lot more

181
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,750
that lieutenant lee Windows you see a
lot more automated things like you know

182
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,130
slamming slow sasser you know all these
little viruses you've seen over the past

183
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,529
six years but people have been patching
the system so they're still out there

184
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,820
arlen actual start running and more
often upon a client's

185
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,970
are which we will see on Windows much to
a lesser extent on me twice a lot of the

186
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,350
but my clients for Windows are on

187
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,350
his client side attacks you know Aunt
Mary goes to

188
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,630
some random website which is
uncompromising the downward into a

189
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,649
system

190
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:39,660
elixir Singler stuff where people are
running on a minute scripts to you

191
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,680
put their botnet clients directly on the
computer

192
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,910
are the overall ability of some sort and
then just optimizing like that and

193
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,339
forgetting about it

194
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,310
our hardware wise nowadays I mean I
guess you know back in the days you'd be

195
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:51,860
into

196
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,709
you know they won't have more more
hardware more more hard processing

197
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:55,470
cycles

198
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,160
you really don't see that notice arm a
band with

199
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,140
that's the only thing they're interested
in they can have an off night no nice

200
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,470
fat pipe down though there

201
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:06,899
you know wearers porn mp3 is there gonna
be happy

202
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,890
on but sometimes just don't even see
that

203
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,130
arm virtualization everyone says okay
I'll be cool already virtualization

204
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,790
are being have my any part no you will
keep my real server on at the same time

205
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,120
without having to

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,720
do any kind of you know technical tom
foolery with my firewall rules

207
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,880
arm yeah you don't want to do that I've
heard that you know two or three times

208
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,990
so I'm just going to toss it out here

209
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,410
arm you never going to be 100 percent
sure that there's not gonna be something

210
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,569
in the hypervisor that they're gonna be
able to see

211
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,839
are gonna break out your going you
compromise your entire box

212
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,510
arm you're never going to be 100 ensure
they're not going to notice VMware for

213
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,480
example a

214
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,089
arm is very easy to detect if you're
running on top oven

215
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,470
are user mode Linux there's a couple
patches that will

216
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,899
allow you to G Latin sure rooted arm

217
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,690
that will save you on the break outside
but their are ways to tell the you're

218
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,730
running within a virtual I system

219
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,920
army and you hear people about running
this on their local home win on their

220
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,250
local server with all their important
documents

221
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,920
I with high attraction honey pot on
stopping attacks like I said you need a

222
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,020
mantra at Leichhardt you need to do it
24/7 you soon as you have a cup you know

223
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,370
your compromised

224
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,520
you need to make sure love you know you
have the ability to be there and

225
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,500
physically unplug that system

226
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,490
and you know disconnect from the
internet so you don't act anybody

227
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,070
arm the hard part with this is actually
making determinations

228
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,839
when the attackers done a lot of times
it's easy when you're actually just

229
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,350
dealing with someone who's you know

230
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,589
spring in praying exploits you know
trying to copy skinning a tire not block

231
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,160
hoping it'll kill not one or two boxes

232
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,640
arm lot sometimes although rarely you
actually run to someone where it'll be a

233
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,860
physical human on the other side of the
keyboard

234
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,680
are where you never exactly sure when
he's done you know

235
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,810
is he's uneasy done putting stuff up
there is gonna come back later

236
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,459
do you want to keep the spots up and
running it's going to be a judgment call

237
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:04,899
inge you know I don't wanna make that
judgment all

238
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,920
because spread frankly I don't want my
system ever touching someone else a

239
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,740
system where I get sued

240
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:13,760
on you need to pull the plug immediately

241
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,000
he said no really now are what people
are only

242
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,620
oh well we know give another week or so
in with the not knowing is are not want

243
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,459
to close enough not realizing that
they're scanning and you know half

244
00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:27,380
China which is down are like a sex story
line

jobless packing not hundreds affective

00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,690
mica said signatures low interaction
honey pots

247
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,060
now I enjoy this picture because it's
exactly what we want to present to the

248
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:39,700
attacker

249
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,399
look at that is wonderful pool with
waterfalls it's going to come right in

250
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,709
when in reality you don't really realize
that the chalk drawing all things the

251
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:46,910
anything below the stairs

252
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,760
choc arm three

253
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,810
low interactive honey pots are the
Pentel the panties

254
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,410
emulates fee call the police on a
physical computer glitch exploits

255
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,189
on runs the basically a bientot what
your porch where

256
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,709
you know somber arm for Windows file
sharing sir

257
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,720
I think of it as a patchy wouldn't want
your other someone's honey G

258
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,910
what didn't plead the moralist does is
at Emilys fee computers on your network

259
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,399
when which you can

260
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,980
you know sense canned responses this is
more or less exactly what the NPC

261
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,060
in algiers are there's another you took
the out there called honey trap

262
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,910
are what honey trap does is weeks for
anything to connect your computer

263
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,630
find support to that and then just tries
to capture whatever the whatever sent to

264
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,610
in

265
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,010
on the panties are you physical computer
setup

266
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,010
arm in like I said goodbye to a bunch
reports

267
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:42,959
it'll use I think it does FTP somber

268
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,610
on Apache and emulated turnovr

269
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,180
exploits are exploitable services so
when you know you see someone running on

270
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,320
in an exploitive says

271
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,779
0 okay yup I'm I'm tackle this technique

272
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,870
are and what then does is it you know
weeks for the person to send whatever

273
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:00,670
going to do

274
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,310
and on clutch whatever they're sending
to you

275
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:09,220
on and have wonderful to act play are
the attacker there's an explain

276
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,269
on the better service says oh geez I'm
on a roll that you know just give me

277
00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:13,800
whatever you send me whatever

278
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,750
and it sends its evil but some code to
compromise your computer and then

279
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:22,620
promptly stops and captured the see
little permissible botch feel again

280
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,190
later

281
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,450
said

282
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:31,470
arm you can help moving in and out a
honey D garments larisa I've never

283
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,000
actually used a honey bun varmint but
with high in trash

284
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,550
any point you 10 months where she went
on HPUX

285
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,790
11 you know when there's 31 anything

286
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:46,469
in of yeah arm behind her actually by
you can choose whatever offerings if you

287
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,660
did I choose Windows and Unix because
you the most commonly exploited ones out

288
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,290
there

289
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,980
arm occasionally when you're going
through your smart launch you'll see you

290
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,630
know

291
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,769
on your own I seventy her hit you on the
way we start at the sleigh wrists tell

292
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,060
the next week

293
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,230
arm very rarely do you see stuff that
specifically tailored to Slayers but

294
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,160
if you want to ask me Slayers box out
there and make them wonder with what's

295
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,519
going on

296
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:16,120
going to happen you know and so we have
W ray who was captured the evil Trojan

297
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,329
in the attackers thinkers as on the
panties

298
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,480
approves it can be used on any existing
server so for example if you have on

299
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,560
your home DSL broadband connection

300
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,000
are a web server that you're using a
share photos you're an FTP server they

301
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,260
are sharing with friends

302
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,250
are you can thus even those model so
that the panties will listen on the

303
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,839
sports and run on everything else

304
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,880
%uh and you will be able to collect
exploits and

305
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,720
arm you know do whatever you want with
them and still run your home server

306
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,750
again this goes back to that whole you
know are you comfortable with this

307
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,450
running on your home server

308
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,070
arm because with as with any program has
one last point since isn't listening on

309
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,760
port can get compromised

310
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,779
I i don't think I've never actually seen
a security but with the panties but

311
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:02,750
I'm sure the exist arm he was actually
something that they're talking about on

312
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,250
the web blog we're

313
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,720
de bot herders were getting wise in what
the panties with him

314
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,779
is say for example you know I'm
compromise and I'm sitting behind my NAT

315
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,839
firewall

316
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,859
arm you know how 192 168 address

317
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,919
are in my you know compromised computer
saying oh you know I'm

318
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,179
I'm scanning everybody but when they say
okay grab my file via TFTP among 192 168

319
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:26,380
the panties a smart enough to actually
say ok and we go try with the IP address

320
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,669
a connected the two

321
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,720
in maybe we'll get lucky are what the
bot herders were doing

322
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,960
were was are sending with a 192 168
address and see if anyone connected back

323
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,070
to when they're doing their stance
making any

324
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,360
more less a real-time blacklisted the
panties notes

325
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,559
so the change default configuration to
not do that

326
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:48,850
arm the person the panties is that if
you ever wanna

327
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:52,090
on collect Windows exploits panties is
your program

328
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,370
you will do all kinds wonderful are you
know sasser blaster

329
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,250
on the tapes keep track of slimmer home

330
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,330
and there's like are that giant blister
exploits

331
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,970
are fire automatic virus exploits and
will try to connect

332
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:11,520
and why we monitor are cons with the
panties that somewhat difficult to set

333
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,309
up

334
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:17,860
arm I your you know you wanna wanna by
ear if you have a chance cuz compiling

335
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,540
it from scratch

336
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,820
is rather difficult like I almost pulled
my hair and I consider myself fairly

337
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:26,820
print for Leo Kane setting up software
arm

338
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,250
its knowledge affects which is kinda
limited like for example I was actually

339
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,660
running at arm

340
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:36,040
this happen couple months ago where
something running rampant on the network

341
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,299
we didn't know what exactly was was
connecting to an event is blocked in the

342
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,020
same

343
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,290
a new next we're not gonna do anything
so

344
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,928
which is really annoying when you're
trying to figure out exactly what the

345
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,260
hell's going on

346
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,830
logging is a bear all the logs are
horrid

347
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,909
on it's not going to be very

348
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,870
tell you exactly what's going on in
actually trying to configure it to do

349
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,200
for Bruce locking

350
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,240
is very pin phone itself the you can
tell that it was done more or less as a

351
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,250
hack

352
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,299
we're so alike she which reblogged this

353
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:11,590
arm Pakistan since listening on port it
can be compromised

354
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,699
are honey trap what is a song like the
panties diet

355
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,500
arm it basically listens for any type of
connection any port on the system

356
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,740
and then it opens up 0 you know i'm
looking on a forty-something whatever

357
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,130
you're trying to send me

358
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:29,940
arm it also you know its is Windows
Linux doesn't really matter

359
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:33,540
are it can be installed on his existing
machines much like

360
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,720
arm honey much like on the panties

361
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,049
in this is very much a homeless man's
honey pot which is even below por mim

362
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:47,889
on how honey trap works you send your ex
would cost on

363
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:51,760
up that so that or does it just

364
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,940
know what every pack whatever this you
know packet is it just sits there got

365
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,450
becki Bronson I'm cool its arm

366
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,700
parties represented dead simple words
very easy it's very easy to set up X

367
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,610
kind of

368
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:06,870
don't see very easy it's easy to set up
in the panties arm

369
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:10,190
very limited interactivity I think
there's a couple love arm

370
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,340
things out there where people are
actually trying to make it

371
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,740
are run scripts and actually say okay
then you know he kept me on port 21 an

372
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,480
FTP server please commuting the password

373
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,540
but I am as for you know the panties

374
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:26,649
does a very good job next address a very
good job going on

375
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:30,570
you know CIFS and some in you know
Windows file sharing

376
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:34,860
I track doesn't do that telling him he
doesn't do neither which is

377
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,580
on honey trap does keep logs which are
slightly better than the panties but

378
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,639
that's really being the tallest midget

379
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,720
um any deep

380
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,630
hand to see my kids a honey D %uh needy
was hoping you was proven Snort rules

381
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,320
you know he's really smart

382
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,530
arm emulates its it's a really nice
program

383
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,370
it emulates hosts on the network that
beer run programs or scripts specified

384
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,799
in the configuration file

385
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,879
are if you have you know slash 24
sitting around in your network which I'm

386
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,169
sure you all do

387
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:08,650
are you can tell it you know honey D
listen for every time a connection to

388
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,000
this classy network that i'm gonna give
you

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,710
you have to you know do some are issues
if your own even a

390
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,380
are listen to anything in you know here
here's my address is you know you're

391
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,860
running a web server on this port

392
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,549
you're running the Windows box on you
know this portrait

393
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,860
running and I guess emulator %uh you
haven't you know

394
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,419
configure down have when I first went
into this I was just I was on a capsule

395
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,910
fly contest we had a classy network that
we could

396
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:36,190
you know hack around on were everyone
else was sitting so there were eight

397
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,780
boxes and I said okay

398
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,440
how can I actually make this very
annoying for everyone else Western a

399
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,740
comedian had listened

400
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,429
every other possible IP adress me so
eight boxes on Boston you 253

401
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,940
I wasn't very popular that weekend arm

402
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,070
it have got a very good amount of my
future career like for example

403
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,639
I mean classes are just getting a bit
ice I've heard people running you know

404
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,179
more or less and higher you can say okay
here's a classy

405
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:04,080
okay but you're also connected this
classy over there but if when you're

406
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,418
responding on it

407
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:09,730
and Emily yourself over 64 killed that
link in will do it you can say okay

408
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,220
you know this link to your inner you
know this classy when your spot where

409
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,600
pretend you have a very leaky connection
might

410
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,240
you know 100 millisecond paying you know
is nothing you wanna do like you know a

411
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,610
thousand or seconds

412
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,740
and it does a very good job trying to
convince people

413
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,580
that you know ok you know I'm actual you
know in reality your Linux box warning

414
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,080
on some time by people in

415
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,439
you know you respond back on Celeste and
you know it'll completely formed a nap

416
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,370
because what a nap

417
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,789
what plea does it take any naps are

418
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,510
you know die I don't know what exactly
they called the file the used to

419
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,750
determine whether or not what operating
system your own fingerprint system thank

420
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,390
you

421
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,860
arm in use that to stand for church
sponsors back some

422
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,309
whoops anyway so we have to be ready in
arm

423
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:56,940
what this is the attacker then connects
to something called ghost

424
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,960
I don't know if that's not the official
term something I came up with I don't

425
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,890
exactly know what they call the Spruce
computers

426
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,110
maybe the Nationals with computer
showing off arm

427
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,910
the attacker comes in and connects to
one of the ghost which point honey

428
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,140
even reply sploosh a fightback from with
the r.i.p that the attacker connected

429
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,250
using

430
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,350
you know it's a sin okay and this IP
sendak what you want

431
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,480
arm now the interesting for this is that
with the whole with honey pot server

432
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,250
honey the server you can actually have
these goes inside him or try soon

433
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,520
in honey server can be sitting on your
you know and this the

434
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,289
non connected to the Internet but
listening to the demilitarized zone so

435
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:36,700
people can actually attacking so

436
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,990
while for example actually discovered
and cons arm

437
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,140
they're gonna tackle Tony Packo's and if
they ever crash the honey Damon

438
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,640
dollars crucial to suddenly disappear
you wanna you probably will not be

439
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,830
compromised

440
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,470
arm you probably know probably is not

441
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,070
a very good too ons in network security
but

442
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,100
it's a for the morning offenders which
is actually from the server on a box on

443
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,669
a physical hardware

444
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,530
are honey services are you can forward
to a wooden what you do when you set up

445
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,590
a honeybee ghost

446
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,809
you say okay ghost your listing on this
IP you are you know

447
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:12,889
running you know each peux 9

448
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,200
are in your actually running a you know
web server on port 80 running it on a

449
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,289
poem port 23 ring FTP

450
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:23,770
on port 21 are what the services when
you're saying you're running FTP weapon

451
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:27,070
something you have to tell it either you
wanna certain script

452
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,918
and there's a bunch of can scripts out
there will get on that later arm

453
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:34,090
you can actually also for these ports
back to host

454
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,928
you know hosted somewhere else arm
you're dangerous because if you're

455
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:39,590
actually running a vulnerable

456
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:44,600
arm post somewhere else that is actually
being used for the sunny services

457
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,600
if the ex with their host that whose
will be compromised

458
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,860
so you want to make sure that that's you
know host is in its you know

459
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,220
bottles padded cell so we can get
anywhere except for your

460
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,840
Kennedy Serve arm scripts I actually
turn running something called a

461
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,629
scripting toolkit

462
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,150
arm it's you know I'm at the mint on a
demon arm

463
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:07,559
I think I did World Wide Web in
basically all it does

464
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,889
is just logs exactly when it runs and
then it's you know turns us moved

465
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,590
response

466
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,470
which is normally for like you know now
have the services 404

467
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:19,330
404 409 E have no idea trying to tell me

468
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,820
armed it also strips feel 100 the
website there's a nice little program

469
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,520
called arm

470
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,650
I A S the MU which is an ISO me later I

471
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,830
emulate I S five and ten a really good
job are

472
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,210
did a really good job spoofing a default
by the server

473
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,220
are another thing you knew what I need
you to set targets where

474
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,510
you know they'll be scanning and no you
know same thing with no Brians that the

475
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,440
just it census in Aitkin Minnesota
window size 90

476
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,539
where if you're scanning your host

477
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:52,090
are honey he is that is cool very
lightweight armed for

478
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,240
the first very that's lightweight I can
you only very numerous

479
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,789
you know links devices computers yeah
the

480
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:02,190
basically if and map awesome FNF can
identify

481
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:05,380
honey bee here unless proven are

482
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,299
these goes can learn everything you can
actually have a you know responding

483
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,080
maxine X Box you have a report for the
two windows box

484
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,658
relieves refers people arm it's somewhat
harder compromise technically anything

485
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:20,370
that ever interaction network can be
compromised honey D just gives you a

486
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,600
little bit over

487
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,510
abstraction there where it's going to be
a touch more difficult if you have your

488
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,158
farm

489
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,539
setup popcorns that acquires a separate
IP four each homes for example if you're

490
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,360
going try to serve us up on your

491
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,330
broadband connection and you have a DMZ
but there's a host 30 in the DMZ

492
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:40,629
you need to get ready that immediate
where the hoes at the white LED want

493
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,260
army good for monitoring

494
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,490
very bad too trying to figure out what
they're trying to do with advanced

495
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,250
attacks

496
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,940
for example arm you know i needy does
not do a good job love you know there's

497
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,230
no way to really strip sample

498
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,940
the yes really can't do it because I've
the way either for calls are set up

499
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,909
and up just it's honey he wasn't
designed for them chip inside

500
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:07,340
are you can you know poured out to
another some server that gets back to

501
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,380
the original point where you wanna have
them

502
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,530
incredibly pattern from somewhere else

503
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,600
now you have all the funny parts in a
few 11 for them because you know

504
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,049
what happens if you're you know mocking
long will you not actually looking at

505
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:19,799
them

506
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,750
bad things where you actually invest
your time you in the first place

507
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,159
are snort snort enough said its

508
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,850
you know everyone use it for an IDS
technically to use any ideas if you have

509
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,809
you know yourself

510
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:35,899
you know a few ten thousand dollar idea
saying underneath your bed

511
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,760
you can use this monitor honey pot for
the rest of us %uh snort

512
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,250
job I murderers back in 1998 as a
lightweight ideas

513
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,510
world news is now arm it's more or less
the gold standard an open-source idea

514
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,020
systems

515
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,480
he's really is made in his own little
company everyone seems to be using it

516
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,480
on in a couple contenders are there that
many

517
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,380
develop in the next couple years that me
provide competition

518
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,250
we'll see ass near in one of the major
winter on house about a sentencing

519
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,789
should be as

520
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:07,059
what I can to mars updates for not
keeping the signatures up-to-date

521
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:11,710
you're not going to be able to catch
anything are the couple utilities

522
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,590
to monitor snort store provides
wonderful alerts file

523
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,610
where you know if you want to have a
panel console window in telling it

524
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:21,840
that for easy to do but if you want try
to catch up to it you know come back in

525
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,010
the morning in DC

526
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:26,500
okay I had to undertake last night's
going to you rather difficult to

527
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,570
actually make see what actually was
going on

528
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:34,200
so they made utilities word arm I'm
going to horribly mispronounce squealing

529
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,429
school %um I it's a

530
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,450
it's an acronym for something it's
basically it's a very nice to

531
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,510
article based are

532
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,760
monitor for you feat alert file and it
will then

533
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,140
you know making a lot of a nice parsing
and you can tell exactly what was going

534
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,270
on and say

535
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,570
okay you know this I P attack me fifteen
hundred times last night action actually

536
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,689
look at that

537
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,940
are the other one is that came out is
peace

538
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,850
came up it was a wonderful product
called acid which is the analysis consul

539
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,270
for intrusion detection

540
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,429
acid stopped being worked on about

541
00:29:08,429 --> 00:29:13,470
a while ago very long time arm and so
what someone did as a song ass and they

542
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,429
said oh wow this is really nice program
to bed hasn't kept up-to-date so they

543
00:29:16,429 --> 00:29:18,809
decided to keep up to date themselves
they came up with base

544
00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,178
acid be Scott who arm

545
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:27,400
I know ATAR %uh in a basin for basic
analysis and security engine you can

546
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,169
tell that was back when in Kenya

547
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:33,480
are based on security is duniya squeals
wheel that source for Jonah

548
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,900
others all very very very likely program
called snort snort snort surfer does it

549
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,820
take some work file

550
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,240
it actually is an under its not under
being maintained anymore

551
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,820
but you taken your file you read in the
Snort are you taking a smaller file

552
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:50,899
region search our it creates all kinds
of wonderful

553
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,000
beautifully keno files we can put on
static web page you have to worry about

554
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,039
PHP

555
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,260
or you know sequel or you noticed toss
it in Internet Explorer if you really

556
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,950
want to it'll work fine

557
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,429
arm base are requires a sequel back and
inquires the store

558
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:09,179
to be configured to feed into a sequel
back and are simple to do

559
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:16,179
us snort very good with that with the
tub on your body in

560
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,860
part makes arm to see freedom the Swiss
Army chainsaw

561
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:25,000
packet sniffing I'm sure most people
hear her David or have seen it before

562
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,020
if you have an how to keep missing very
musty

563
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:31,520
arm PCB don't you can use it to monitor
everything

564
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,529
arm basically you can say TCP don't just

565
00:30:34,529 --> 00:30:38,549
capture every packet you see ever in
writing to a file

566
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:42,720
um if you run see if you read TCP number
something called the snap when

567
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,580
RTC people by default only capture X
amount of bytes

568
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,928
in if you're monitoring say anything
segment your package can be up to 1500

569
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,159
bytes so it's only going to capture that
first X semana bytes for

570
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:56,750
with the sample snap when is configured
for so if you're using it to monitor

571
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,299
your intrusion detection you want to get
in

572
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:03,158
best picture what's going on you wanna
have to set as your maximum transfer W

573
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,000
I learned that the hard way as you can
tell arm

574
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,860
it's very handy to piece together a new
attacks foresee stuff that smart missed

575
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,380
it's not like I said signature-based are
if you can capture everything

576
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:19,059
so what you want to do she won't have
TV's TCP don't you

577
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:22,860
capture everything the store is missing
and if you want for example

578
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,460
has some typos if store doesn't have a
security exploit for its signature yet

579
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,500
the just came out

580
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,270
not even three hours ago TCP TCP don't
allow you to you

581
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,549
see what the heck's going on and if's
you know someone that

582
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,309
someone is that's more is asleep at the
wheel you can actually configure your

583
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:40,190
own stanton for that

584
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,649
arm mother times with our internet storm
center:

585
00:31:43,649 --> 00:31:47,600
if for that you know people actually go
for that on the call

586
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,159
if you've seen roughly come out the ass
for people to capture TCP don't you can

587
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:51,419
say

588
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:55,059
haha I can do not a commitment to you
arm

589
00:31:55,059 --> 00:31:58,210
what it is is there's a pick-up format P
cap is

590
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,640
pretty standard waves that TCP don't
write to files and you can import that

591
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,279
it's more

592
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,880
Wireshark arm network crap and crap are

593
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,130
its very standard almost any type of
packet dumping impact if utility will

594
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,960
support in

595
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,190
arm morning if you are using TCP dumb

596
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,190
and I'm sure that no one hears doing
anything illegal of their internet

597
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,330
connection

598
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,439
are you are monitoring your network if
you're going to monitor your network in

599
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,140
the social comes up for snort

600
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,100
are you may require traffic that you
need not want reported

601
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,659
you know going to you know person should
I dot com or something

602
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,029
arm guru you know it make sure the GCP
dumps more whenever you're using a

603
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:44,039
monitor network is only picking up a
package she wanted to

604
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,629
not to say you know your console where
your training on piratebay

605
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:50,850
some of you gonna knock on the door you
not having a wonderful here company

606
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,020
would be capped by you know you can use
it with marcia

607
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,820
all Marjorie honey the independence now
honey bee in the Panthers

608
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,428
a honey D has a very are keen file
structure for two logs

609
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:06,940
the Panthers like I said to hack the
kindly said ho JIS you dread walking

610
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,370
feature on this

611
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,240
arm its independence the honey bee
logger very arcane like it's like you

612
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:13,600
know

613
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,409
host IP space your destination IP space
port number and then it's like you know

614
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:23,440
45 different type 5 file wanting it for
months

615
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,230
home thankfully I came across as
wonderful utility that not a lot of

616
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,760
people are using hope renewed

617
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,340
up it's called preview ideas which is
stupid because it's not an idea they're

618
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:31,809
like

619
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:36,309
ho JIS Wilco treat an idea still compete
with Norton the relay switch

620
00:33:36,309 --> 00:33:39,428
does we suck that bad now doesn't arm

621
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,470
it's very much a way to call a re a
cooler reading

622
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,720
indications mornings arm he has

623
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,470
you don't need to use a but has a pretty
web-based console see can show it off to

624
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,220
you

625
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:54,230
supervisor significant other with
everyone your rooms actually seein'

626
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,760
arm it's very nice has a great program

627
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,820
horrible documentation like I d like you
know just awesome things up on their

628
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,879
website and I got stockman Rosser

629
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,149
you would really like some other people
the writer documentation for us

630
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:11,210
ship arm it's really bad

631
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,619
and marketing its its disgusting like
it's like equines like you to surf the

632
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,099
web interface

633
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,879
please you know attached bloodied happy
okay you're you're all set

634
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,379
when it's not working too bad on its
open-source

635
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,230
arm but it's not really open source is
released under GPL but if you're on a

636
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,520
free to patch for you have to sign over
your patch

637
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,960
to maintain her so that they own it

638
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,069
astor's to the same exact thing I never
been comfortable with it so I just

639
00:34:37,069 --> 00:34:40,308
whenever a grid pattern just released
under my own license

640
00:34:40,309 --> 00:34:43,440
and I don't let 'em incorporated into
their source tree

641
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,458
forget you arm help rude works

642
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:50,058
are also for actually seen actually so
the two files on the bottom for sale

643
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:50,919
honey if I own

644
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:54,440
and the panties file on that gets ready
to something

645
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,299
called eat real food L&L now the only
offense for lacking LogMeIn

646
00:34:58,299 --> 00:35:02,359
lackey log document from lucky lot
manager lacking I don't know

647
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:06,160
they funnel some thank you but I can
remember what it's called arm

648
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:10,549
their prima no avail and peace like see
for example you have a snarf

649
00:35:10,549 --> 00:35:14,059
concepts or shorted solution mining that
must be fed in something called a prelim

650
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:16,559
internet actually does all the
correlation

651
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:19,749
and will lock it into one giant database

652
00:35:19,749 --> 00:35:23,400
win then from there you can actually you
look at the base for of using free

653
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,130
vector which is what's up on the top
there

654
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,930
I'm in a better future where home you
can monitor

655
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:33,129
arm lot of Steve no its not just honey
the units not just the Panthers if

656
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,029
you're using

657
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:38,099
any you know its support the prima donna
lesional you can support a lot of

658
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:39,809
different Tom

659
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:42,869
log file managers and what log format
are

660
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:46,009
you know Apache your system long so for
example if you're running high

661
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:48,819
internationally part you can actually
use prima del male

662
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:51,999
a force you know of someone if some
attacker actually sees this

663
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,599
the all-star to wonder what exactly is
going on Michael even kill it

664
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,979
immediately

665
00:35:56,979 --> 00:36:01,559
in here to sort of rushed cosa we wake
up others just some stuff that it's all

666
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,680
this is a screenshot of the web page

667
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,118
arm so for example a musher community at
the first light doesn't witnessed

668
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,219
robot text access it's normal arm

669
00:36:11,219 --> 00:36:15,259
units as you know to to TCP packets
dropped which was coming in through

670
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,479
our free will mail which is actually
something from the I P the internal

671
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:19,489
firewall

672
00:36:19,489 --> 00:36:24,160
arm TCP backdrop meant for the bottom
you know how everything is nice

673
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,910
aren't up on the top how we got on to
read you know it's bad because it is red

674
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,160
armaments is looking back orifice
traffic detected TFTP after

675
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
getting that alarm both prelim alerts
and Stormers

676
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,538
for what it actually is done in the you
really can see from here it said it's

677
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:43,039
all correlated to a single time frame
from a single IP so this

678
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,819
ET two dots whatever character is doing
something very nasty

679
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:50,950
so it's something you actually look at
now response

680
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,789
now in our winning this wonderful sport
impact running this wonderful sport

681
00:36:54,789 --> 00:37:00,119
an apparent her honey pot what exactly
are we going to do with them

682
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,279
uses guy couldn't do you want to do this
just fine was doing similar

683
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:09,509
OKC gonna techno noticed real real
options you can take you can do nothing

684
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:12,859
you can attack back we can take down the
server

685
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:19,089
do nothing easiest thing to do
overlooking contact

686
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:23,170
arm saves your time effort and have a
little frustration trust me I know

687
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,739
icons that you're actually not being a
good neighbor you not actually

688
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:28,249
accomplishing anything

689
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:31,579
your choice is yours attacking back arm

690
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,209
yeah an idea in

691
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:39,180
on Cohen's I'm sure nobody really ensure
no one hears ever even thought about

692
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,288
doing this

693
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:43,900
arm legal on are you really attacking
the attacker

694
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,119
lot of the times you'll actually see arm

695
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:50,359
coming do we have a question you ever
heard of a

696
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:53,828
like a botnet herder Mary's propagating
is botnet

697
00:37:53,829 --> 00:37:57,209
and another herder having a a honeypot
to capture their

698
00:37:57,209 --> 00:38:00,379
and then using as attacking back does
that occur arm

699
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,549
yes I I actually have a honey pot but
actually the shadow server project used

700
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:05,670
to have publicly accessible

701
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:09,660
all of its on statistics of reports on
turn on

702
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,160
what nots and what they're actually seen
the actually in the evening what

703
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,808
people's access from this is that

704
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:18,930
are monitors were going around saying 0
he's a really big botnet

705
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:22,549
I'm want that and they were attacking
the computer they've no

706
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:25,880
somehow compromise the botnet where they
either came in and they saw okay all

707
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,450
these computers are attacking are

708
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:31,779
attach this botnet they obviously must
be a voluble the Sunday before I believe

709
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:33,709
let me just attacked these computers
rather than

710
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:37,399
skinning entire class A so what they
were seeing as

711
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,359
you know these computers you know
someone's getting up to an IRC server

712
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,259
seen the computer

713
00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:44,950
the infected computers attacking those
affected computers making them part of

714
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,650
their botnet rather than the

715
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,329
you know other bad person arm

716
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:54,479
and Sony they actually had removed at
home I'm sure

717
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:59,359
honey Porter actually being used by the
people who we don't want using on but

718
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,869
I have never heard of anything X I never
heard any hard evidence of it but

719
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:06,930
it's definitely within the realm of
possibility arm so is it legal

720
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,269
I'm sure we all know that farm are you
really attacking the attacker

721
00:39:10,269 --> 00:39:14,670
what the times or just be attacking a
you know some help was grandma and you

722
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:14,920
know

723
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,469
Sep you know its northern New Jersey are
who we don't download this thing off the

724
00:39:19,469 --> 00:39:21,529
web trying to get money but even

725
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:26,509
are and the other question is what
exactly are you attack

726
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:29,989
what exactly you accomplishing alright
so you you know picked all these

727
00:39:29,989 --> 00:39:32,349
computers

728
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,519
regulations you know it's you you remove
the you you know you remove the

729
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:40,069
be evil botnet client these computers
are still being attacked they're still

730
00:39:40,069 --> 00:39:41,859
going to compromise because unless
you're

731
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:44,989
going out and being in a Robin Hood and
patching the system's

732
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:48,849
arm which is nestle legal people like us

733
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:52,309
I O I was just trying to help people now
they gonna fly you're going yet

734
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:55,329
you know the must just be 10 a.m.

735
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:59,630
they had a wonderful issue about
researching buttons and legal issues

736
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,729
wow I was kinda fried some of the stuff
that I was doing

737
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:05,900
I thought it was you know solid tight
you know I wasn't actually

738
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,609
attacking anybody I was just you know I
will show you an example some things you

739
00:40:09,609 --> 00:40:10,869
can do afterwards

740
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,950
arm but some other stuff I just try to
take down servers where I say no

741
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:18,279
the service work on my speed remove them
now I'm not sure if

742
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:23,969
stats 171 other no promise you're part
of the problem

743
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:27,910
takedowns now you know takedown has been
named as we all know but the mint movie

744
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,200
arm this is not you know you're not
going to be punching you know

745
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,779
whoever that was shimmering of

746
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:38,509
approach with takedowns that their legal
effective in the actually remove you

747
00:40:38,509 --> 00:40:39,869
need a problem

748
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:43,699
arm what it is is will show you later is
an OK got attacked

749
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,719
alright me your contact an ISP you know
talk to Barb whose you know the first

750
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:51,660
tear hope their stepped aboard and try
to get that removed

751
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,249
d normally doesn't even know now you're
talking about arm this is very much a

752
00:40:55,249 --> 00:40:55,819
whack-a-mole

753
00:40:55,819 --> 00:40:59,410
because despite you trying to remove
this computer arm

754
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:01,549
they're going to be two or three
definitely set up like a certain

755
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:02,799
interval frustration

756
00:41:02,799 --> 00:41:06,009
this is exactly what I'm talking about
on it a lot of effort

757
00:41:06,009 --> 00:41:09,489
and you can keep on the somebody's ISP's
for like two weeks at a time not have

758
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:10,140
this

759
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,269
to not have the stacking computer
removed we like

760
00:41:13,269 --> 00:41:16,599
well geez we contacted the person but
even actually you know leave us a valid

761
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,630
email addresses phone numbers changed in

762
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,809
just taken off from pope damn thing

763
00:41:22,809 --> 00:41:27,099
also actually go through a web takedown
and this is exactly what I love to do

764
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:27,910
speech

765
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:31,190
take down the hard way arm soul this
happen

766
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,969
actually last week I got my three my
honey pots got probed

767
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:39,589
arm Webmin store was there was a
forecast for mobility I had no idea

768
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:42,299
would help forecast was something
sometimes

769
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:46,849
porn thinks arm you know in this is
exactly how I feel on the bottom you

770
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:47,829
know I feared own

771
00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:50,959
edgar Allan Hall have my cigar mental
connection

772
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:55,319
know here in wrapping on my door arm a
little bit closer

773
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,430
ok for me arm

774
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,919
the ca2+ saw caves from snort was a you
know some twelve have 3036

775
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,549
3 o'clock in the morning I was not them
so definitely wasn't something I was

776
00:42:06,549 --> 00:42:07,390
going

777
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,859
arm it's the Steeler was a witness
forecast

778
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:14,459
removed from it could execution attempt

779
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:17,819
Tom and you know you see all the stuff
coming in from sports noon actually has

780
00:42:17,819 --> 00:42:18,979
really nice plugin

781
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:23,839
are called I am I DM EF which is the
intrusion detection messaging format

782
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,119
in a couple months actually problem six
months ago at this point came

783
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,849
RFC so it actually is a valid you know

784
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:35,039
XML format for on that other vendors
hopefully we'll

785
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,619
start supporting soon so you can
actually have your other IDS is and

786
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:39,799
firewall start

787
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:43,549
reporting into your free loot server or
you might actually find something that

788
00:42:43,549 --> 00:42:46,779
actually has better documentation then
prelude to you for that

789
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:49,910
arm has a little smart specifics of town
bottom like you know you're under

790
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,259
Pacific your CV your butt Track ID

791
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:55,329
mmm so you're under 60 or 90

792
00:42:55,329 --> 00:42:59,589
are so going further down the line we
actually this is

793
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:03,029
further down the page same page are
here's a list of some sort

794
00:43:03,029 --> 00:43:06,199
and we saw Kate secure termed arm

795
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:09,369
it's you know you sit down with the bomb
counter tools and reminders in

796
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:14,660
its in

797
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:20,069
arm all my for my presentation will be
up on my website for later

798
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:23,549
are so strenuous mod file include
attempt are

799
00:43:23,549 --> 00:43:27,288
if you look at the on track I D in the
CEO actually see what exactly the

800
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:28,140
buggers

801
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,879
are all file inclusion I've seen it has
enough website because this is

802
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,410
exactly the point I was trying to make
if you say okay this person attacked me

803
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:36,469
this is IP this

804
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:41,119
the IP that I didn't burnout that's the
actual person probably tachometers its

805
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,249
Russian Federation

806
00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:46,539
however this IP that they gave us they
did wrong blur out is that it's a

807
00:43:46,539 --> 00:43:50,259
arm not it's a complete innocent third
party

808
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:54,150
which will finally here so in other word
of warning I just added this the other

809
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:58,119
day after hearing over my legal things I
didn't do any of this my friend bob did

810
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,420
I did he just said when I came the IPS
in if you really look at the store and

811
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,209
hence

812
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:05,598
arm this is an interesting thing

813
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,170
are it's like I always do was kinda
Hickory rearm now I know

814
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:13,019
even more too easy Correa with that
presentation yesterday

815
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,609
arm whether or not what exactly you
doing this question whether or not it's

816
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:18,089
actually going on

817
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:21,369
you can say hun researcher but you know

818
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:25,119
try saying that to the FBI knocking on
your door for him

819
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,499
so anyway we saw this file its flashed
up slash one dodgy I have to file

820
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:30,789
they're trying to feed us

821
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:35,119
arm we decided to grab it knows how you
store if I so it's going to an anonymous

822
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:35,910
proxy

823
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,140
even if it isn't legal do you really
want this to come back to you you know

824
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,598
you might wake up to an external service
on your hands

825
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:45,869
believe me it's happened to me

826
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:51,529
arm anyway so this one not your efforts
awfully small files only 104 bytes

827
00:44:51,529 --> 00:44:55,809
Morpheus helped me that strange we've
heard that before not to go back to the

828
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:59,219
if we go back to the Snort in actually
the if you look down

829
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:03,199
really close you have really good night
you'll see user-agent: more vs

830
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,339
Morpheus f ing scanner and it's not
sanitized

831
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:09,739
arm wrongly

832
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:15,619
arm so okay obviously it's a wonder gf
is not actually Chia file

833
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:19,239
alright so I know it's actually hostile
attempts not someone accidentally miss

834
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:20,390
configuring the server

835
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:23,859
was trying to prove my server stranger
things have happened

836
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:28,180
arm so what ahead actually this is where
it starts being me even more

837
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,190
questionable dear actually really wanna
see

838
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:33,579
much further on the server you can
actually worked or find links you don't

839
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:36,880
actually want to use real web server cuz
what happens all kinds of nasty exploit

840
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,099
sitting there

841
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:42,069
arm but okay Apache 2051

842
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:45,339
that's kind army is a sax the attacker

843
00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:49,690
no probably not if nasa if this actually
wasn't Open Directory we saw like you

844
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:50,349
know

845
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:54,059
you know microsoft office 2007 to ISO

846
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:58,390
chances are this isn't known pop on if
we go to the actual website

847
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:02,219
it's all blown out shoveling on be able
see exactly what it is arm

848
00:46:02,219 --> 00:46:05,539
it's an actual website have a nice warm
front page said Oh

849
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:08,959
you know where doing this wonderful
service for people and I was like I

850
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:11,348
really don't think there's actually some
type of

851
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:14,459
arm person trying to attack you think
it's probably either

852
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:17,749
third-party computer someone trying to
compromise me however

853
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:21,410
looking upon the IP address I found it
was hosted in United States

854
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,749
if you ever want to take down United
States people are the most cooperative

855
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:29,410
that's not saying much again tallest
midget arm if you try to take something

856
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:30,180
non-russian

857
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,940
some good luck trying to be done to
China again good luck

858
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,119
arm this is what I rode up those

859
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,599
takedowns are wonderful exercise and
social engineering arm

860
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:43,680
I created I was like oh geez I hope you
like the actual start doing this and

861
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,979
actually to Notre dude

862
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:48,099
you could name a name on the internet
thing so I created my own little

863
00:46:48,099 --> 00:46:49,630
third-party entity called me

864
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:53,630
chemical weapons you know started my own
website for all kinda cute little things

865
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,430
up and now I'm an official security

00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:00,180

group found tools being used for Texas

869
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,650

00:48:22,979 --> 00:48:26,529
I don't know is your actual export
somewhere in the site yeah probably

898
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:30,680
I don't know if they fixed it arm a lot
of times you'll see a wonderful thing

899
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:33,788
where your server is not responding
anymore you'll see arm

900
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:37,029
this website has been suspended please
contact your you the owner please

contact support

902
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,380
arm so this is actually as a good thing
sometimes you have to send out repeated

903
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,949
emails to the people sometimes you have
to you know including your caps lock

904
00:48:47,949 --> 00:48:51,239
sometimes you have to get more to the
upstream no fighter saying you have the

905
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:53,869
science PE he's doing the evil nasty
ugly things

906
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:57,559
on and he's not responding to me and one
at times level 3

907
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:01,019
I know a couple people who know people
in level three and they can say

908
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,859
they make a phone call person paying the
bills Inc if you want your network

909
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:06,239
connection still up you need to fix this

910
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:10,009
because they aren't they are some
cooperative um

911

into your print server seeking a good
idea there too arm

935
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:22,819
real time intelligence gathering system
to know which proving one

936
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:26,249
we have all the information let's go try
to make some type move listo

beer something and I'm

950
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:15,529
so questions

951
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,870
yes I'll come up to the mic I think
everyone's been asking them

952
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:23,370
I actually getting to know

953
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,609
to questions you see

954
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:32,960
ISP are there we go

955
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,360
I have you seen that I S p's don't want
to cut off

956
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,550
pain customers and so they just kind of
ignore you because then yes that's

957
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,250
exactly what you're saying like oh no
it's a paying customer you don't even

958
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:44,370
need to disconnect and we tried to
contact him

959
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:48,120
using it on his phone business you know
to he beat Houston going as

960
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,460
web 2.0 funds and then for the other
question

961
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,590
for your first idea would apply again

962
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:58,910
for the open source nexus of work so
that your little ones as routers running

963
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,799
as a honeypot

964
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:04,050
home leases runners exactly was more or
less when I was picturing but I'm not

965
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:04,630
sure

966
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:08,810
I think they were trying to poor defense
he's over to you on you see live before

967
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,080
arm all that mission good

968
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,470
arm trying to do for weeks as box but I
don't think they actually got as far as

969
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:17,220
a1 a2

970
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:20,390
um you know I'm sure there are some
really my thing here than actually do

971
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:21,060
that for them

972
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,299
um another person yeah

973
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,310
time's up the young a snore log analysis

974
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:31,279
how does the smoothwall snore analysis
compare with some say like Palin

975
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,690
near Houston meanwhile fine don't tell
me

976
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,190
once it's fantastic I've heard good
things about him directions to practice

977
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:40,520
law

978
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,800
on I'm actually curious as to whether or
not she will have an idea mia farrow

979
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,780
plugin if they have that they can feed
already you know analyzed report over

980
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,120
the prelude which I'm sure will

981
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,490
happily accept them I was going to ask a
question that the

982
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:58,850
previous cast about using Alex's box as
I D S box

983
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,910
sounds like a good idea if they yeah

984
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,149
mean if you you can put freemen lol it
supports a variety of log formats

985
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,280
so they may have something first we've
already in there there's like

986
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,460
in their definitions they have like you
know somewhere in the range between

987
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:14,230
20-30 files just

988
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:18,380

with my honey pot

1017
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,220

1018
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,810
seeing on your store offering a honeypot

1019
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:04,190
sequel slammer quest like I would really
get about 20 to 30 per day

00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,750
arm I got some even afford corporation
call their home call

1021
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,390

that's not us jury p I don't care if GDP
it's a sleepless limits might be is

1024
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,420
but I am they eventually governor that
naturally when I started actually

1025
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:24,690
looking at the IP was VPN account guess
they don't consider that there from

1026
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:28,460
owner yes earlier you showed that letter

1027
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:32,790
yeah and he said made a big impact I
think that movement that will make that

1028
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,140
even more than impact

1029
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:38,490
the Senate in the language above the
country that is hosting yeah I'm only

1030
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,810
you and I don't speak any other language
so I don't know how to translate it

1031
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:44,430
they might find a translator and get
them to translate that that's the only

1032
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,930
way I can arrange the other hand I'm
sure if I really wanted to I could take

1033
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,040
my wife and children so they can forge
he's been

1034
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,250
not made any Portuguese IP zooming into
are

1035
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:58,520
when since obviously we can run a botnet

1036
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,300
commissaries anybody that is putting the
other any sort of central clearing house

1037

1038
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,240
organize honey pots in any way so they
can all report to the central area is

1039
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:10,560

1040
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:14,880
30 with the website is arm I'm they're
more as a research perspective I don't

1041
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,350
