1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,129
strikes on

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:06,859
but the but I think the

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,320
I i think what's what's interesting is
is actually

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,789
see hope now and I was

5
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:17,910
almost not gonna come to this I didn't
think anybody would really be interested

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,230
in hearing the again

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,080
and I was also I Monday when I go back
I've got to get all my furniture into my

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,860
office

9
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,759
because we found someone to rent it on

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,039
but I think at the end of the day

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:36,059
we have to decide whether we're here in
the moment and trying to help each other

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,248
or whether we're just gonna be tuned out
in and I'm not preaching to you because

13
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,050
believe me

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,739
ill be a year to perform certain that
I'm not drinking

15
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:48,260
are as a matter of routine on

16
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,589
but I think a I was doing more damage

17
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:55,739
through neglect to my family and stuff
like that

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:59,649
then good are and now also I'm feeling
stronger

19
00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,539
I mean you know for for you poppies in
the audience that are under 55

20
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,719
everything up to 55 is training wheels
you're only an adult after 55

21
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,509
are and I figured that out when I turned
50

22
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,729
and I looked around and there was brent
scowcroft

23
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,880
still going strong enough haha shit

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm still a baby %uh anyway life is good

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,560
are so questions on the substance yessir

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,390
police good wish that wears a microphone
other two microphones

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,990
okay to only mentioned %uh National
Security Statement around 200 the

28
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,490
Henry 2002 that okay tolliver by it was
two thousand okay go ahead

29
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,579
this from why do you think they're still

30
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,009
some 9/11 conspirators that say that
9/11 was an inside job like

31
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,740
what do you think needs to happen before
way he is even possible for people to

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,759
just let it go

33
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,619
in well no it's not possible to let it
go because there's too much there to let

34
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:03,109
go

35
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:10,109
on I A have read and reviewed most to
the books and most the DVD's on 9/11

36
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:17,050
and I am persuaded that 9/11 was at a
minimum let it happen

37
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,040
arm I believe that this plot was hatched

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,269
by bin Laden and elements in the
Pakistani intelligence service

39
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,560
that are extra tremely radical Pakistani
intelligence services basically like

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,900
three different slices there's the
really wild ass

41
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,159
Islamic Jihad slice and then there's the

42
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,429
pro-western slice and then there's the
middle kind of ground you know

43
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,610
Pakistan is an independent Islamic
nation that'll do whatever it takes

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,769
but the Pakistanis are not stupid so

45
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:52,040
when the western side to the Pakistani
intelligence service got wind of the

46
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,780
extreme aside to the Pakistani
intelligence service and what they were

47
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,209
doing

48
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:59,819
they came and blew the whistle and my
reading tells me that no fewer than nine

49
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,709
nations

50
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:04,040
told the united states. in advance that
this was gonna happen

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,500
the israelis even sent the video crew in
advance

52
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,510
to position itself so as to be able to
take pictures

53
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,920
on at the same time

54
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,629
I believe the Mossad told Larry
Silverstein

55
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:23,000
are that this was gonna happen now so
first and had a real its best this

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,569
problem

57
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:27,939
it was one he couldn't afford to fix and
this must have been a gift from heaven

58
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:32,670
because among other things in cahoots
with the Bush family member that ran the

59
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,810
security company

60
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,680
they basically close down all the
cameras for weekend

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,819
the videotapes so they're on all the
dust the residual dust and everything

62
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,680
the thermite evidence is there

63
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,849
are I think the install controlled
demolitions in all three buildings

64
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,040
in the pentagon I think it was a missile
a major general single office on

65
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,379
record on TV as saying he was say love
was a guy in charge of all soviet

66
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:56,430
imagery analysis

67
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,799
he says this was a missile and if you
look at the early pictures

68
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,239
it's actually a whole up here it's not
until later that the stuff collapses

69
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,879
on and there's no video evidence a.m.
whatever

70
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,099
AI I will come back to JFK by saying
that

71
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:16,220
we now have a book called someone would
have talked which establishes to my

72
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,190
satisfaction the JFK was killed by cuban
exiles

73
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,719
using CIA training and see a sniper
equipment

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,340
that they were you they were given to
take castro up

75
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,610
and they chose to take Kennedy out
because above the Bay of pics

76
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,520
arm and I'm a hot-blooded Latino myself
that I know cubans

77
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,590
and I think this is totally totally
credible aus walled was a patsy

78
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,479
while he was in the lunchroom when it
happened where he had been every day for

79
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,900
the last text number I've

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,840
of months and he's the only one of all
the people tested who

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,380
did not test positive for gunpowder
residue

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,740
period he had no gunpowder residue in
the weapon was the weapon that was used

83
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,419
in there were more than one shooter in
more than one shot

84
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:05,620
and and so forth so coming back to 9/11

85
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,620
up rudy guiliani school opened up
giuliani

86
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,030
I have enormous respect for the
firefighters in New York

87
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,819
and if the firefighters in New Yorker
pissed off to something there

88
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,800
arm what actually ended up happening in
you you know the question you always ask

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,300
regardless of what you know about the
circumstances is who benefits

90
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,350
okay so I think that a Larry Silverstein
got a

91
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,810
a insurance bonanza and I'm sure was in
cahoots with

92
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,990
at least some executives in the
insurance company because insurance

93
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,560
companies are not stupid

94
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,789
you don't pay out double terrorism
indemnity

95
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:45,349
two weeks after the building's been
insured without doing a massive

96
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,979
investigation so I think there's
actually

97
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,729
this is a lot of money laundering saying
this is an insurance scam

98
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:55,568
a you know that's let's at

99
00:05:55,569 --> 00:05:59,400
well building 7 may have been the
control building for the remote control

100
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,120
override

101
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,139
that made sure these assholes hit the
building are and there is no evidence

102
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:07,630
that there are actually people on the
airplanes

103
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,620
online factors this one line of thought
that says that this was this was a

104
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,789
combination of Directed Energy Plus

105
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,940
a drone I don't know what I do know

106
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,490
as a person who reads nonfiction for a
living what I do know

107
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,050
is that the 9/11 Commission was a
complete whitewash

108
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,050
at best it was grotesquely incompetent
at worst it was a cover-up

109
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,180
are and what I do know and and Mike

110
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,280
car the guy that road crossing the
Rubicon

111
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,810
are you're my group written I have been
having conversations over the phone

112
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,949
arm I do know that there is more than
enough

113
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,539
evidence to warrant an indictment in an
independent

114
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,639
people's Commission or citizens was them
Council

115
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,199
on all this I don't know but but I mean
it it still needs to happen

116
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,199
you know 911 is probably the crime of
the century

117
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,690
because no building in history has been
brought down

118
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,690
by an airplane are until 9/11

119
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,330
and you don't pay a cake I mean a
building if it weren't like that he

120
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:12,690
would

121
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,520
goal sideways and the testimony the
firefighters on the radius and

122
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,530
everything is the explosions went from
bottom up

123
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:24,919
okay arm so basically three thousand
people were murdered by american

124
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:25,990
officials

125
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,500
and I suspect that cool yanni was the
only

126
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,460
person in New York City in the No are
and it's one of the reasons the

127
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,870
republican party treats them with kid
gloves

128
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,900
arm cool yanni

129
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,770
apparently had already orchestrated the
trucks

130
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,419
each with the GPS system to keep track
at the stuff

131
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:52,440
he scooped and dumped are a lot of gold
and other valuables that weren't sure

132
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,560
there's no evidence that they were in
the rubble are and a whole lot of SEC

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,280
files got destroyed

134
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,090
so when you ask yourself the question
who benefits and you look at all this

135
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,680
and there's a whole bunch of other stuff
I mean my second book

136
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,849
up what well the Patriot Act nobody

137
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,219
now you know yeah Bush benefited but

138
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,639
yeah yes you're right but I think this
was this was this was more than the

139
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,830
Patriot Act this was this was the
neo-con agenda if you want to stay in

140
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,378
the neo-con agenda

141
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:24,849
there's a wonderful book called and game
winning the war on terror

142
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,139
by general Mac in earning a couple of
other real morons

143
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,100
on and these are the guys who think they
can nuke their way through the middle

144
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,940
east

145
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,340
arm it's just not working for me

146
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,900
but i wanna say that in my second book I
have a section on 9/11 what happened and

147
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,730
why

148
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:45,290
and you had a number of intelligence
failures in policy failures for example

149
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,800
911 the FBI had to walk ins

150
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,090
one in newark new jersey one in Orlando
Florida

151
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,350
both well in advance of 9/11 and both of
them wanted to tell the FBI about the

152
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,870
9/11 plot

153
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,280
and the way the FBI mentality is when
they're busy not opening

154
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,100
computers that they've captured all the
FBI mentality is

155
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,820
if if you tell us names and those names
are not in our file you must be a

156
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,040
fabricator

157
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,569
this is how stupid they are okay us we
had to walk ins

158
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,790
we had a guy in a German chale calling
every single day for a week prior to the

159
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,610
event

160
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:24,120
are as I said we had at least nine
government cell so

161
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,050
bottom line for me is that 9/11 was
allowed to happen

162
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,570
by the way the crisis command and
control centers in

163
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,180
the World Trade Center Seoul why do we
need one on the pier in New York

164
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,560
alright obviously we know that we're not
gonna be able to use the one that's in

165
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,510
the World Trade Center okay and Dick
Cheney

166
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,620
dick cheney if you go back i mean
they're two books and Dick Cheney that I

167
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,840
highly recommend one is called the one
percent doctor the other is called vice

168
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,900
dick cheney the hijacking the American

169
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,220
presidency ok

170
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,840
I generally don't mention books I have
reviewed arm

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,720
because I don't know are it's not gonna
pushing myself I'm just sayin

172
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,340
you know near your others reviews their
and my view user summit to for example

173
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,040
my review of the second book

174
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,339
itemize is the 25 high crimes and
misdemeanors the Cheney is committed

175
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,860
are to simple examples colin powell
succeeded in getting the north koreans

176
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,560
to accept our terms

177
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,460
and Cheney said well that's not what I
want and he put more on our Sturm's

178
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,600
down patrolled the north koreans way for
the table had i

179
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,100
in Powai were told Cheney to fuck off
and gone public

180
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,320
are the iranians use the Swiss to
approach the US government

181
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,260
and 2003 saying look we'd like to
comment re thing down in the region were

182
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,500
ready to negotiate

183
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,020
everything's on the table cheney
throughout the offer and shoot out the

184
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,430
Swiss for daring to bring it to us

185
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,510
okay me Cheney is a nakedly a moral
criminal

186
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,290
on and sadly the International Red Cross
is now about to come out publicly and

187
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,250
say

188
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,550
that the US is guilty of war crimes and
this is cheney

189
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,100
Bush our generals

190
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:12,770
well yes yes but you know again I come
back to hold the power for information

191
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,680
you know why is it that I'm the only guy
going around saying that exxon didn't

192
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,190
make forty billion in profit wise and
CNN doing this

193
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,130
ok Annie we know about ownership and
stuff but we have to do is we have to

194
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,570
push all this out

195
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,490
so now you're never gonna put 911 to
rest just the way we weren't able to put

196
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,110
JFK to rest

197
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,510
until the truth finally came out arm

198
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,740
truth actually does have a tangible
value in the long run

199
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,140
and I think this going back to these
Truth and Reconciliation commissions

200
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,020
it's not possible to be a great nation
on a foundation of lights

201
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,660
are in America right now is a

202
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,589
a cheating culture that's the name of a
book that I've reviewed

203
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,170
all it's a cheating culture I'll we have
really

204
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,839
managed to basically commit intellectual
and emotional and civic suicide

205
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,850
since vietnam on and

206
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,390
thats a shame yessir arm I was wondering
um

207
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,449
what you know and I how do you feel
about Osama bin Laden being a CIA asset

208
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:15,410
with the code named Tim Osman

209
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,689
as well as Dick Cheney running the North
American air defense drill Valley in

210
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,050
worrier on the morning of 9/11 winning
as

211
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,130
no affiliation with that agency

212
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,920
right okay does it to the questions
everyone heard 'em

213
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,150
night %uh number one I don't believe

214
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,850
I i believe i seeeeee colleagues when
they say that we did not find bin Laden

215
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,090
bin Laden was a self-funded Saudi funded
capability that went into Afghanistan

216
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,310
and in fact he had a lot issues in
Afghanistan because they were Arabs

217
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:50,140
and and the people in Afghanistan in and
Pakistan are not arabs

218
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,180
and so there was this conflict between
arab Islam and

219
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:57,900
arm and non-arab Islam arm

220
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,020
a I'll also tell you that might cheer

221
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,040
each book he publishes comes closer and
closer to saying bin Laden's write more

222
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,290
wrong

223
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:11,939
in other words bin Laden's problem is
with our presence in the Middle East

224
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,730
and the despotic Saudi royal family
which consists of sixty thousand

225
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,240
assholes

226
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,690
who live at public expense and and
basically

227
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,630
you can kidnap a b-list movie star for
about fifty thousand dollars and she's

228
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,030
put on the saudi Learjet

229
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:29,130
she's gone forever by name

230
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,439
I mean that's really interesting a
system me i've read the

231
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,020
the declassified federal document from
the FBI warning the CIA not to go

232
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,699
non so backwards the CIA to the FBI not
so good after

233
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,800
Osama bin Laden because he is a caso
railed by the name it too much and yes

234
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,610
it's on federal check the Common Era

235
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:52,000
e-books archive I'd I'd love to I'd love
to have the URL my email address is bare

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,200
at 0 SS that netanyahu will email you
that right now

237
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,890
yeah i i'd love to have the URL arm

238
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,890
a my II don't

239
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,760
you know the everybody can be a CIA
asset in one way or another

240
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,700
are I know bin Laden was visited by CIA
station chief when he was in the

241
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,770
hospital

242
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,819
on in the morning yeah but but

243
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,050
its its in general the CIA's biggest
mistake in the Middle East was too

244
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,540
allow the saudis and the shah and others
to say

245
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,099
you can talk to our dissidents socios
basically cut down when the iranians

246
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,400
took over the embassy in Tehran

247
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,920
they captured the four CIA guys that
were there and they were seriously

248
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,240
pissed off for two reasons

249
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,990
only four and then if you speak Farsi

250
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,160
who the fuck do you think we r somalia
okay

251
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,280
I mean CIA is not serious

252
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,930
in a lot of these places arming today
CIA's poppies

253
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:57,090
okay and it's it's tragic arm

254
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,620
but going back two years the second
party a question right to a dick

255
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:05,220
cheney's yeah alright calm in with the
9000 I'm here that was a carefully

256
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,060
calculated

257
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,480
arm plan it was actually a
government-wide exercise

258
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,560
it was a government-wide exercise it had
a scenario

259
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,480
planes crashing into the NRL are it was
a government-wide exercise that allowed

260
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,040
Dick Cheney to keep his control over the
entire government

261
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,130
it allowed him to move the arm

262
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,880
the strip alert aircraft out love the
eastern coast

263
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,600
arm there is a very well established
protocol

264
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,610
for dealing with aircraft that go of
course

265
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,220
in at no time in history until 9/11 had
no ride ever failed to intercept such an

266
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,590
airplane within 15 minutes

267
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:47,090
in 2008 67 Mb inner sense with one
hundred personnel brave see exactly

268
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:50,440
exactly so the literature is quite clear
here %uh

269
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,280
there is something wrong with this
picture well yes I mean

270
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:59,120
my smoking guns for I mean I am a firm
believer that 9/11 was a false flag

271
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,110
operation

272
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,050
as a pretext to go to war with Iraq into
create a paycheck the judgment to police

273
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,850
in the US

274
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,640
eventually by to them 2012 through
operation endgame through the the

275
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,980
parliament security

276
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,300
in North American Union and there will
be no one will government however %uh

277
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,450
the reason why I feel this way is
because a

278
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,650
the norad implications with the cheney
as well as

279
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,260
I'm he was one of the architects a
project for the new American Century was

280
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,950
called for a new Pearl Harbor

281
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,170
right let's let's downplay this because
I want to get to a lot of other

282
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,250
other questions I think I I'll meet you
halfway this has to be investigated

283
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,240
it was a let it happen are there were
crimes committed against american sitter

284
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,420
just absolutely

285
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,000
abysmal are I was talking a lady that
talked

286
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,290
my anyway alright so let's move on from
this and when you press a year old does

287
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,420
anyone have another question over here

288
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,660
I just have a quick question if there's
any hikers the left in the room

289
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,920
what in fair reflection would do you
need or would you like

290
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,190
up

291
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,620
up

292
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:11,620
her phone number now yeah

293
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:18,620
a that's a great question what
information do I need or do I want

294
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,750
well if if if you could he if you could
scrub

295
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,010
there is intelligence network I mean I'm
not very good at website promotion and

296
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,510
stuff like that i mean

297
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,700
I my wife is really pissed off at me
because

298
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,740
I spent my profit from the last two
years creating a nonprofit

299
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,000
are which turned out to be exactly the
right thing to do

300
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,360
the last eight thousand dollars I had
left I spent publishing this book

301
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,920
and taking my name of it and that turned
out to be exactly the right thing

302
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,550
to do by divine providence I wanna I
wanna give your question very very

303
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,139
careful thought

304
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,680
in 1992 Iran the first conference on
open source intelligence and CIA said

305
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,610
will will come but only if its secret US
citizens only

306
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,070
in I had to say what part of open source
don't you understand

307
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,399
arm and fortunately

308
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,100
admiral studeman as a fellow naval
officer allowed me to gain

309
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,860
an audience and I said so this is not
said he ordered them to attend

310
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,020
and then after he retired to a open
source intelligence became known within

311
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,110
CIA

312
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,500
including its own open source people who
are mediocre menopausal grandmothers and

313
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,730
young white kids on it became known as
open source

314
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:40,710
Sora ES arm

315
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:46,030
I think that the whole idea it's not
what I need it's what we need

316
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:52,030
the whole idea here is we need to create
a citizen intelligence minuteman core

317
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:56,720
and the problem that we've had and I'll
tell you what I told the hackers in 1994

318
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,300
you know the I understood what was
happening I understood that people are

319
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,669
finding vulnerabilities and I understood
that there were good hackers and that

320
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,450
hackers and stuff I said look

321
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:09,190
you've got to create a website you've
got a basically when you find a

322
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,810
vulnerability you go to the company very
discreetly in privately you tell them

323
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,110
the vulnerability you offer suggestions
on the fix

324
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:20,580
and if they haven't fixed it in 30 days
then you go public

325
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,850
okay and course you guys did listen to
me than

326
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:30,850
arm for the generation

327
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:35,820
well yeah that that's a very that's an
absolutely reasonable

328
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,929
thing to say and that's why my web sites
based in Sweden

329
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,160
on okay

330
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,040
arm I mean I I hear you but that's
that's not good enough

331
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,409
are but I also understand because Bruce
Sterling wrote hacker crackdown and i've

332
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,390
testified

333
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,340
in writing against Secret Service lies
against akers

334
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,720
I me a you can understand these guys
live because they don't know

335
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,420
it's not that they're bad they just
don't know arm

336
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,630
so anyway what I think we really need

337
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,620
a what I think we really need

338
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,820
is the blogging

339
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,320
love this mean up citizen intelligence
minuteman I mean we're trying to set up

340
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,350
a system right now where we will train
anybody for free

341
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,890
are so that they can become their county
or municipality intelligence officer

342
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:30,270
and I've had to stop it briefly because
yeah

343
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,030
I've I've been using up life savings
because I Mike might might

344
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,180
for-profit business was killed by the
war it was taxed out of existence is

345
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,900
funds were redirected so I no longer
have a multi-million dollar business

346
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,390
arm and some technically unemployed

347
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,560
arm but

348
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,399
for a while there for about two years we
were publishing a weekly report called

349
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,770
global challenges the week in review

350
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,510
and we've been doing this worldwide
survey we've got this wonderful Access

351
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,560
database an open-source enter in
Australia that's where my non-profit

352
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,639
stuff is based my for-profit obscenities
and sing

353
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,350
and at Singapore in Sweden arm

354
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:13,510
and we're publishing report which
basically in eight pages

355
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,660
the top page was a one-line summary of
what had happened any to the 10 threats

356
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:22,940
12 policies 8 demographics and then each
of the succeeding a pages had like two

357
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,700
or three headlines for each of the 10
threats to of policy so forth

358
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,010
on in our next big step is to tie this
to budgets

359
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:34,040
and a star publishing what we're
spending on terrorism in poverty

360
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,830
infectious disease and so on

361
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,800
so we've got we've got a lot of work to
do but we've been investing heavily

362
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:43,680
someone else has been investing heavily
in were about eighty-five percent

363
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,120
if you guys wanna see the future go to
scout dot com

364
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,170
and then imagine that applied every
single topic on the planet

365
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,890
okay Scout dot com what it's about as
and user-generated content

366
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,590
alright so what I want to do is get to a
point where all the citizens

367
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:03,659
love Westchester County are essentially

368
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:09,400
online their feeding stuff up including
hand-held photos with GPS coordinates

369
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,850
in Taiwan right now they're paying money
to citizens who take pictures of

370
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,380
corporate pollution

371
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,800
and then send it in with a little
template no are so they've harnessed

372
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,450
the distributed intelligence evolve
their citizens

373
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,060
so I guess you know trying to be very
unselfish year

374
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,240
are I guess what we really need is we
need for this mean

375
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,660
of public intelligence and the public
interest to get out there

376
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:39,090
are you know day get whenever I don't
blog really I've got a blog citizens

377
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,300
party dot com I don't have a lot of time
for

378
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,630
arm and I don't spend a lot of time or
money on trying to make earth

379
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,180
intelligence network very popular

380
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,770
but the thing that would really make my
heart sing

381
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,200
is if people started taking
responsibility for keeping the

382
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,410
government accountable by using public
intelligence

383
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,780
to educate others and to then show the
lunacy in the idiocy in the graft in the

384
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,889
corruption

385
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,450
that permeates our entire governance
system

386
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,290
we should get you have to talk because
there's that you we should get your talk

387
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,110
at TED

388
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:16,150
well you're reaching like a couple of
thousand you know internet millionaire

389
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,470
it's funny you mention that because

390
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,120
I think Ted knows who I am and they're
not yet sure whether I'm a lunatic or

391
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,040
genius

392
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,379
either they're quite a political so
maybe you need to reread tomorrow I

393
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,030
would be

394
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:31,200
I would be honored to be invited to
speak at TED

395
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,060
are you know I've i've seen others that
they've spoken by the way I highly

396
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,169
recommend the Ted website where you can
see the videos

397
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:43,720
the people have spoken are Barnett who
wrote a really shitty book

398
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,460
has matured tremendously sense then

399
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,610
and I was very impressed by is Ted
briefing and I went back and modified my

400
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,860
review to say it's still a shitty review

401
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,680
but this guy has really evolved on

402
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,800
and so forth and other questions home
thank you for asking that question your

403
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,830
me okay

404
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:08,220
yeah okay this is gonna be a little bit
more met and I hope not too far I love

405
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,320
meta

406
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:13,050
left field but you know a lot of the
problems that

407
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,629
that everyone hears talked about it in
many these conferences seems to have to

408
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,730
do with

409
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,150
the fact that human institutions at a
certain point in time

410
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,700
whether it's because they become too big
were too albright

411
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,040
um the start sorta collectively so
selecting towards

412
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,830
yes self-serving %uh right insular

413
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,149
slash evil behaving right um

414
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,580
and I wonder if you've looked into you
know looking at behavior models and

415
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,610
self-organization

416
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:48,110
and you know whether or not you see any
validity towards

417
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,030
you know applying mass behavioral models
in some way

418
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,790
to you know provide scrutiny

419
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,280
were or two or incentives against

420
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,379
you know what me you know the ethical to
Kiev organizations yeah

421
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,040
necessities as that's a very good
question on

422
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,340
the couple's angles on it number one %uh

423
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,770
the Woodbury in concept the bureaucracy
and the whole pyramidal organization

424
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:20,550
above the industrial era was based on a
time when information was difficult to

425
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,450
get

426
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,190
and hoarding information was in fact a
source of power

427
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,140
on now we're moving through pyramidal
away from pyramidal

428
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:32,660
are toll word squares and circles

429
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,010
on his literature on that and there's a
chapter nearby

430
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,900
jean-francois nobel on who's one other
girl reserve collective intelligence on

431
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,250
that

432
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:47,650
and Jim Ross has experimented with
citizen wisdom councils I mean I don't

433
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,440
know if you know the Danish

434
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,200
the Danish have a what they call a
Danish citizens

435
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,820
Council where if there's a really major
issue the Denmark wants to consider such

436
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,139
is so whether or not to allow
genetically altered crops into Denmark

437
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,140
they get 12 Danish citizens whose only
requirement for the job is that they

438
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,430
know nothing about the subject at hand

439
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:12,800
and then they are turned into a kind of
Supreme Court

440
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,850
and they are allowed to call witnesses

441
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:18,840
and they're allowed to grill them
they're allowed to subpoena them they're

442
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,110
allowed to

443
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,460
basically force them to to provide
evidence and so forth

444
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,400
and then at the end of it this council
deliberates and it comes up with the

445
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,130
conclusion and thats brief the
parliament and that's it

446
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,590
it's over the citizens have decided

447
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,850
arm so what are the things it that we're
really struggling with and I think the

448
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,980
many these big businesses are starting
to realize this the the smart money I

449
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,790
mean look at look at which wiped it spun
off an electronic thing which then 8 the

450
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,570
parent

451
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:51,040
that was a good move arm while

452
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,280
what are the things that that's a real
problem here and and John Bogle has a

453
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,460
book the battle for the soul of
capitalism basically america is no

454
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,550
longer an ownership society

455
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:04,750
we've spent the last 20 years creating
financial derivatives and hedge funds

456
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,280
and all the stuff

457
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,250
and we're Bogle says and he's one of the
top money managers on wall street is now

458
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,559
retired in Pennsylvania

459
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,860
he says that essentially the money
managers the financial

460
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:19,880
guys have stolen one-fifth the value

461
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,700
of all the stuff they've been managing
they basically ripped off all the people

462
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,220
you know these guys are pulling up three
hundred million dollar paychecks plus

463
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,730
half-billion dollar bonuses I mean perot
took his money out of the stock market

464
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,360
and prior to the crash in the eighties
because he said any industry that pays a

465
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,750
27-year-old million a year it's gotta be
nuts

466
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:44,480
arm and I think that's true arm

467
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,880
so the the industrial there are no
longer works now

468
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,140
kirkpatrick sale you remember school
lockers book small is beautiful

469
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,160
kirkpatrick sale wrote a book called
human scale

470
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,429
and we're right now at a point where
there are two

471
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,020
complimentary new directions

472
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,210
new direction number one is home rule
eat local

473
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,660
a if you want to do business in our
county you have to

474
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:14,520
opt out of corporate personality
liability protections and and that kinda

475
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,350
thick

476
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,250
the other is global assemblages and
we're not talking

477
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,670
North American Union or world government
or whatever we're simply talking global

478
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,820
assemblages

479
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:27,840
and see your ending up with this
cross-cutting matrix and I just finished

480
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,920
reading David Weinberg this book

481
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:34,130
everything is miscellaneous it's a
really fine book weinberger by the way

482
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,330
is one of the top guys

483
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,280
on on open spectrum no

484
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,290
he says everything is miscellaneous in
the whole point of his book

485
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:48,149
is that structure databases are history
and that the reason you want to be able

486
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,309
to have a completely unstructured where

487
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,700
is because it allows that same piece of
information to fit

488
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,820
within multiple matrices okay

489
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:01,309
all and so I think we're getting we're
getting very very close to where people

490
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:05,000
can opt out of the bad and opt into the
good

491
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,559
for example I commend all %uh view bar
the World Index in environmental and

492
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,399
social responsibility

493
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,410
as well as the enteric project of you
get hold of the entire project will come

494
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,160
in

495
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,450
the work with a local bank to create a
local credit card

496
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:25,420
that then gives back to the community on
and they're also credit cards and other

497
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,110
means by which you can

498
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,460
kinda register your social values and if
you then go to buy

499
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,030
are something that that was created by

500
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,170
sweatshop labor the car to be declined
you know i mean that kinda stuff

501
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,790
of I need to take a break are but I'm
coming back so please allow me to just

502
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,040
go to the bathroom and then I will be
back in

503
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:50,740
and I will not leave until I've signed
every book that you wish or sold every

504
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,150
book that we can

505
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,809
for your Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe

506
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,800
I $350 billion dollars all right time
out I'll be back in no more than five

507
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:08,800
minutes

508
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,440
up

509
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,520
did pleasure bye bye

510
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,750
yeah i know somebody have to catch the
train are

511
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,490
and some %uh view drove in so that you
could get back that's wonderful

512
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:46,880
what's going on

513
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,900
we filming okay

514
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,940
okay that sounds good yes ma'am

515
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,360
hi I wanted to ask a louder mmm

516
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,080
how he made a remark on Friday that
really intrigued me about that

517
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,480
what are the biggest on covered stories
right now home

518
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,270
was the on electricity blackouts
brownouts I think it particularly struck

519
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,460
me because I was here in

520
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,120
2006 when you know much in New York less
power for

521
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,920
oh you know it's in some places for up
to almost two weeks which

522
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,450
was so striking arm

523
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,630
and I just wish you could elaborate more
on their

524
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,630
and also maybe recommend a few bucks or

525
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,420
own articles or whatever well

526
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,820
what what what's striking to me is that

527
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,510
everything that's happening to us now
was was

528
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,180
easily anticipated decades ago on

529
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,380
and I forget the exact quote but

530
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:54,070
apparently somebody said that the
beginning at the collapse a civilization

531
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,020
would be

532
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,420
on the beginning of the spread of
blackout spots

533
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,300
you know and and we've had accidental
blackouts for example a city in New

534
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,400
Zealand lost power for an entire five
weeks

535
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,550
the entire city because they're mean
power

536
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,010
cable just fused into itself and it

537
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,800
talk that long to to fix it arm

538
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:22,220
NSA is now trying to build its own power
generator

539
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,460
which I will suspect is gonna be nuclear

540
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,340
up because they can't rely on the grid
now if I were president

541
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,990
I'd say wait a minute however I just
take away your budget we make the

542
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:36,490
great work are you now so this is kinda

543
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:40,450
idiocy here arm but what is happening
now

544
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:44,299
and and people it's it's subtle but
apart from crashes

545
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,899
I mean like the SCO's crash that was
caused by Canadian tree that hit you

546
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:48,668
know whatever

547
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:53,690
apart from crashes and accidents we have
an extremely fragile infrastructure

548
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:59,020
are him they're basically 18 generators
in the United States and if you take out

549
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,860
the Hoover Dam and you manage to take a
10 the spears

550
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,410
and then you go burn down the German
factory that makes some United States is

551
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,420
in a Hurt Locker

552
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,930
8 18 major

553
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,069
power generation sources you like Hoover
Dam

554
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:19,320
he this I guess I don't know what I mean
I

555
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,570
heard it from someone else alright okay

556
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:27,400
the bottle eyes were very very
vulnerable and we have an entire society

557
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,840
that is based on the assumption of cheap
are

558
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,430
unlimited energy and so as a result

559
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,690
a you've got this entire city is made a
buildings that were designed

560
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,560
on the assumption that the windows would
never open arm

561
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,810
and it was designed on the assumption
that the elevators will always work

562
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:49,440
arm you know is that it's wrong

563
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,990
as a matter fact when you add computers
in you and all the other things that are

564
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,120
coming on line we're now burning up the
wires

565
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,029
are in fact in Iraq I was talking to
some civil affairs guys we made

566
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,950
a huge mistake are a used to be that the
dam would feed most to the power to

567
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,660
baghdad

568
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,549
in the outer cities were kept down well
some good hearted American engineer

569
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,210
decided to be more equitable

570
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,410
any sent equal announce a power out any
fried all lines

571
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,620
okay going out to the hinterlands
because they weren't designed to take

572
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,690
more power than they had already been
established for

573
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,100
on so we have an infrastructure is very
viable

574
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:32,270
tell you the infrastructure concerns me
most is water there's a book called Blue

575
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:32,910
death

576
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,799
and what it basically says is we've
relied for ever on chlorine

577
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,720
as the basis for municipal water
purification nevermind the fact that

578
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,370
its wonderful to have chlorine tanks you
can blow up and really fuck up

579
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,540
neighborhoods with

580
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,580
are but are

581
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,609
the corn is not working and so if you
don't have a point to love

582
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:58,259
point-of-sale kind of filter

583
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,670
you're actually at risk if your own
water giuliani water

584
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,740
okay are in russia they have a worse
problem in russia they

585
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,330
they lay down the water pipes and they
put the sewage pipes on top

586
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,730
are in the same ditch are yeah

587
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,060
now all those pipes a crack in and the
russians a drink and shit

588
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:19,250
well here right

589
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,180
right self what what what I would say is

590
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:29,990
is that if I you know I i mean around
the world toward my own expense in 1994

591
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:33,730
and I made a cold call on the Singapore
National Computer borden

592
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,230
bunch of others all over the world the
only country on the planet to listen to

593
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,640
me was Singapore

594
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,830
and today singapore is the world's first
smart nation

595
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,170
are they really do get it and the

596
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,170
there followed closely without much help
from me by the Nordics

597
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:53,170
Denmark Norway Finland and and Sweden

598
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:57,040
and then next up would be the
Netherlands on in some ways

599
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,390
but but the Netherlands hasn't gone as
as far as I

600
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:05,750
would have expected yeah I know I know
but the thing is only talk too clever

601
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,690
Dutch you know so they're constantly
failing

602
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:13,350
they're constantly faking me up by the
way I like your presentation very much

603
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,549
was really really excellent

604
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,600
arm so

605
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,790
we're were rapidly getting to a point
where we should expect

606
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:28,050
basic amenities the start to degrade
there's a wonderful book called The Long

607
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,940
Emergency

608
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,050
and I mean I wish now that I had cashed
out in the Washington DC area

609
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:38,300
are four years ago sold are

610
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,590
house soul my little office townhouse
and

611
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,680
and basically moved to Vermont but my
family didn't want to

612
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,940
and I may yet return to government

613
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,300
are and so we're standing pat right now

614
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,780
whoever the next president is is going
to have to redefine Homeland Security

615
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,710
are Charlie Allen the undersecretary for
intelligence and analysis said

616
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,100
at Homeland Security is is the senior
member

617
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,790
my very small fan club on in washington
I've managed to alienate just about

618
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:11,090
everybody there

619
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:14,180
arm but

620
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:19,190
he only focuses on terrorism where his
homeland security requires intelligence

621
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:24,380
analysis about poverty and infectious
disease and environmental degradation

622
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,630
I mean development standards we should
put a stop to all development in flood

623
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,390
plains florida is now in really deep
shit

624
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,440
time just did a wonderful cover story on
Florida I mean when you start drinkin

625
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,180
salt water under the tap you have a
problem

626
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:42,359
are and sold these things are spreading
across the nation

627
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:46,420
and unfortunately I didn't realize this
until I read hunting with Jesus

628
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,840
unfortunately its job it's not just the
elite in washington that is totally out

629
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,670
to lunch

630
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,530
and not work in the public interest it's
the little micro leads in every small

631
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:57,380
town across america

632
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,080
okay they're screwed over their local
populations they're selling out to

633
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,359
corporations

634
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:06,430
and the very thing that could save us an
educated citizenry

635
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,700
is not being created okay yes sir

636
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:14,070
you have a microphone I guess they do on
the note have corporations do you agree

637
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,820
that when the best things we could do

638
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,680
would be the systematic cleansing I love

639
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,180
anything to do with the corporate I'm
product

640
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,210
in our lives you know coca cola and
Heinekens and and all those things that

641
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,359
are produced

642
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,270
by corporations as much as we possibly
can are you are you saying that we need

643
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,509
to move immediately to homebrew

644
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:38,359
not media his as much as possible keep I

645
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:42,529
well you let me dissected on several
levels hmm

646
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:48,390
Nami climb is a real genius and I love
her books no logo and shot capitalism

647
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,230
I think she's really made a huge
contribution

648
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,540
the it's funny because when I go out to
Seattle I like to tease the natives by

649
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,620
walking around the soda can

650
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:02,160
of you know a because they really get it
out there

651
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,310
and and and they have these little
sipping cups you know that are

652
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,440
sustainable

653
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,050
and the refill a min then they said
problem it so no possible as it takes

654
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:13,250
more water to make a plastic bottle then
it carries

655
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,359
okay cell at one level it's all
packaging issue

656
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,540
at another level it's the whole
nutrition issue at a third level

657
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,870
it's the whole labor fairness issue I
mean if I were president

658
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,600
if you're not a member the pro up a
labor union your ad here

659
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,430
okay everybody should be a member of a
labor union or professional association

660
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,589
are we have lost with respect to the
rights of labor and citizens and so

661
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:39,480
forth

662
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,670
on what's at first

663
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,530
all a yell when he when he when he broke
the back

664
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,410
the air traffic controllers strike that
was that was the beginning of the end of

665
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,649
american labor

666
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:56,220
and that was very very wrong and the
military people

667
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:59,850
it again I have this real problem with
the military people as a Marine Corps

668
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,710
officer

669
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,060
on they they tend to confuse

670
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,440
loyalty to the chain of command with
loyal to the Constitution

671
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,570
because a properly educated general
would have known

672
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,180
that using the military to break the
back of an american strike was the

673
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,500
equivalent of violating the posse
comitatus act

674
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:24,230
okay it was using labor rather than arms
it was violating the rights of american

675
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,589
labor on American soil

676
00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:28,920
and they should never have been allowed
to get away with that

677
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,510
okay so arm

678
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:38,460
I A believe that we are caught between a
rock and a hard place

679
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:42,540
peak is most people are earning a living
apart from the free and independent

680
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,720
spirits

681
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,490
in this room most people are earning a
living as part of the beast

682
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:50,560
and they wheel I on the beast for their
paycheck

683
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,859
and so we don't have a migration
strategy yessir

684
00:42:53,859 --> 00:42:57,940
with a microphone in harmony with that

685
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,540
one thing that would cement we could do
almost immediately

686
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,070
is change the corporate charter which

687
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:09,900
you know dictates at by law they must

688
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,200
always maximize shareholder value

689
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,850
or it's against the law and the other
thing is remove

690
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:19,740
they're standing under the Fourteenth
Amendment as a person well I certainly

691
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,990
am reliable

692
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,430
yes no you're absolutely right click the
the the the 14th amendment was intended

693
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,990
I think for Friedman

694
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:30,020
to to for freedmen of color to

695
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:33,870
to assume their proper standing in
society and it has been grotesquely

696
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,319
abuse by corporations I actually agree
with that

697
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,520
however I also agree with with changing
the corporate charter

698
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,870
and that's why we're starting to see the
emergence of hybrid

699
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:49,020
organizations that or combination of
Corporation a nonprofit and and and

700
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,009
people are starting to realize that the
triple bottom line

701
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,280
social environmental and profit now I
would have a more simple change to the

702
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,490
corporate charter which is to say you
will show the IRS the same books you

703
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:01,339
show your stockholders

704
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:06,400
okay because right now they have triple
and quadruple books I did my first

705
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,850
I did my first ya yeah basically
corporations have a tax return

706
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:17,140
which says we didn't make any money this
year and then they pay dividends

707
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,980
saying we actually did make a little bit
of money there's actually a third set of

708
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,950
books

709
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,060
which says we didn't make any money we
made a little bit of money and oh by the

710
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,240
way are Cayman Islands bank account is
now

711
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,570
you know plus stop by by half a billion
dollars

712
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:37,700
yeah I mean Halliburton paid $15 million
dollars in taxes and billions in profits

713
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,270
now for five years ago whenever the date
was from are let's use the microphone

714
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:47,000
so yes I think I think cleansing
corporations is certainly big part of it

715
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,730
and I think by cuts are not buying the
wrong stuff and buying the right stuff

716
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:53,320
the certainly big part of it

717
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,130
I mean if you look at my closet I have
way too many shirts way too many

718
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:58,410
t-shirts

719
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:01,730
well when I was growing up in Singapore
my cooks

720
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,140
a sons who were very industrious
students they had

721
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,940
two white shirts and two pairs of pants
and then I think one set of kinda like

722
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,050
casual clothes

723
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:14,180
pair jeans and a t-shirt and that was it

724
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,980
and they never ever look dis disrepair

725
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,970
thus leveled or whatever you know
whatever a as possible to get through

726
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:24,350
life with with just two sets a close

727
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:27,770
on okay using the microphone so which do
you

728
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:31,140
then do you think either those are
possible which is more possible than the

729
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:31,580
other

730
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:35,370
and cleansing out that from our lives
from our side orange or changing the

731
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:37,220
charter and the amendments

732
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:40,670
and how it's abused always certain leads
from our side

733
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,760
is the first arm one other fascinating
things for me is there something called

734
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,680
scan back which allows the third party
tool you can

735
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,859
take a picture for barcode and send it
to Amazon

736
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:56,609
and they'll send you back the price %uh
that product if you buy it from Amazon

737
00:45:56,609 --> 00:46:00,490
now once you have that to a channel
established there's no limit to what you

738
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:00,900
can

739
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,730
get back through that channel so I
anticipate the day coming

740
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,730
when when you'll be shopping for t-shirt

741
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,940
annual or designer shirt or whatever

742
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,589
and it'll come back and say yeah this
has a thousand five hundred liters of

743
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:16,120
water

744
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,120
from the growing up the corn through the
flushing the chemicals

745
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,720
it was brought in from China so it's got
six gallons UHV

746
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,020
fuel in it are and it was made by

747
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,100
10-year-old boys in forced labor camp

748
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,000
you know whatever that's kind of a
little off-putting are

749
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,130
and then you can say I will either I'm
not gonna buy today or what would you

750
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,280
recommend

751
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,450
and then would say well over here is
this organically grown t-shirt

752
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:46,710
from louisiana on that has minimal
chemicals in it

753
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:50,540
and you know is sick is cheaper

754
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:54,600
okay so so there's information is going
to play a role in our lives

755
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,770
like nobody would believe even a group
is advances this

756
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,600
and I'm very very excited by that yes
sir on the venom information as well as

757
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,109
talk about presidents and where
corporations are telling communities

758
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:08,740
what to do

759
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:12,850
should we be starting from the top up or
fucked up down or from the bottom up

760
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:15,609
because there's a lot of small
communities have worked with enough

761
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:17,950
electrical inspectors in various towns
cities

762
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:21,660
know that information between small
towns is not

763
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,790
get around there's a lot of people
reinventing the wheel or just doing it

764
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,040
their own way

765
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,650
that's a that's a really interesting
question first %uh bottom-up is

766
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:33,609
is the answer are at Park be leadership
has bottom-up

767
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:36,650
let me see I've got a slight hear that
that shows it

768
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:41,220
arm what you also raises an interesting
question

769
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,430
love sharing best practices on

770
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:48,109
part of the reason that I put so much
effort into earth intelligence network

771
00:47:48,109 --> 00:47:49,870
was because I realized

772
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,130
that the do good movement

773
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:56,540
is even more fragmented than the do bad
movement

774
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,880
okay it's just all over the lot are

775
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,460
and we're not talking to each other and
we're not sharing information

776
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,940
and if you take something like poverty
arm

777
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,670
let's take poverty in County axe upstate
why

778
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,859
there's a hundred different government
organizations doing

779
00:48:13,859 --> 00:48:17,600
anti-poverty stuff sometimes in conflict
with each other

780
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:22,230
and there's these do good organizations
doing anti-poverty stuff sometimes in

781
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,680
conflict with each other

782
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,480
I have a vision one day for a global
range of gifts table this is what the

783
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,620
Foundation's call

784
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,569
you know the range of gifts is is naming
rights for the building

785
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:35,839
or the toilet paper or whatever arm

786
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,430
I anticipated a when it will be possible
to identify the needs

787
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:43,940
down at the household level %uh every
family on the planet

788
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,350
are and at that point we will start
seeing peer to peer foreign assistance

789
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:53,420
and we will start seeing the creation of
new forms of community

790
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,600
arm now

791
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,540
it turned off by me lemme let me get it
back up because this is a fun slide

792
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,320
on so the short answer is

793
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,170
all of the above you've got to do
everything all the time

794
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,109
arm my third book was called all
information all languages all the time

795
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:15,980
and one of the problems I have with the
entire information industry

796
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,920
is it it's trying to pretend that a
unique proprietary enterprise solutions

797
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,339
which

798
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:25,170
this group certainly knows you don't
it's trying to pretend that there is a

799
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,190
technical

800
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:29,230
alternative to thinking which there
isn't

801
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:33,620
are it's trying to pretend that
structured higher graphic

802
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,089
are that man behind you what's the
microphone it's trying to pre 10

803
00:49:38,089 --> 00:49:43,290
that structured organizations and and
command and control architectures

804
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:47,950
our rum thing went to sleep on me is a
good deal by the way

805
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,010
del 750 all with XP

806
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,819
adele is the only one that broke ranks
because I told The

807
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:59,330
under-secretary-general United Nations
the directive on be and the director

808
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,690
National Intelligence as soon as I heard
about this stuff about a year ago year

809
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:03,670
and a half ago

810
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,780
I sent them each an email and I said
don't

811
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:10,020
let anybody Bikefest and ignored me

812
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:15,270
on and soul today across campuses across
america

813
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,730
kids are tearing their hair out thinking
their parents are stupid

814
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:21,980
and mmm

815
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:28,980
to help Ronald

816
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,680
up

817
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:38,810
well yeah exactly know what what I did
was was I called around and I i

818
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,270
I went to Best Buy they were locked in
the Vista they weren't even allowed to

819
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:42,950
ship

820
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:46,280
without Vista Dell was the only one that
broke ranks del

821
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:49,950
I said I'm not buying this unless it's
got XP on it and

822
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,010
and I'm still waiting for an easy open
source

823
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,630
combination

824
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,010
really that's good that's very good
that's a good start

825
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:03,920
but the next thing we need is the next
thing we need is is all the analytic

826
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,480
tools and try to figure why the hell
this damn thing won't turn on

827
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,000
way we wait you're not using the
microphone I

828
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,430
know he's he's got a question oh yes I

assistant secretary of defense for

843

845
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,130
waging peace

okay and crown lawyers are Ian I have

arm chin because

848
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:33,630
screener what we've realized what we've
realized is that

849
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,859
you know handouts a prevention is a
pound a cure

850
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:40,060
%uh the problem is you know what the
hell's going on here

851
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:45,670
you take it well wat oh I see I just

okay okay with you now so why can't I

853
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:56,900

854
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:03,460
now okay as well pipe on yeah

855
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,109
okay fuck you to machine alright this is

856
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:10,970

now is good

859
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,700
re the computer thing when I'd really
like to see I know it's kinda there but

860
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,859
not for most people

861
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:28,690
would be a version I love linux-based OS
that looks and feels

862
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,319
reasonably pleasant but also lets you
install stuff

863
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:36,019
without being a total clinics key are
yeah

864
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:40,549
no i i agree completely if you want
we'll talk more about civil affairs

865
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:43,950
but the the future the future I believe
in fact

866
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,869
II lecture to to parliamentarians in
Europe at garmisch-partenkirchen at the

867
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:49,440
george bush

868
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,299
parmesan whatever a at the George
Marshall Center

869
00:53:53,299 --> 00:53:56,359
and I talked about having a core force

870
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:59,730
colin powell's base force was a force
for war

871
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,799
the core force is

872
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:07,579
communications unclassified intelligence
and global mobility

873
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:11,390
it's the infrastructure and what is
happening now

874
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:14,879
is that the rest the US government
doesn't can't mobilize

875
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,700
the the cabinet departments are not
geared up to send people to some all

876
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,109
your to burn do whatever

877
00:54:21,109 --> 00:54:24,680
a and so what I see happening here

878
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,420
is all over time I anticipate a white
hat military

879
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,569
that becomes the core force so that for
example

880
00:54:33,569 --> 00:54:38,460
when East war happened question number
one was where the bodies

881
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:41,609
question number two was where can we
land in question number three was who's

882
00:54:41,609 --> 00:54:42,519
coming with what

883
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:45,829
and how do we coordinate with them and
nobody can so that there were like 40

884
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:46,450
different

885
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,720
intelligence analysis group working on
this problem are I anticipate the day

886
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,900
coming when something like the tsunami
in Thailand happens

887
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,619
and the military literally is there in
six hours with the with the first-team

888
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:00,539
and second-team 13 piled on

889
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:04,470
and they become the command they become
not the command-and-control club

890
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,960
the information sharing and sensemaking
hob and the final coordinator for

891
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,839
logistics

892
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:13,990
me and everybody coming into the area
feeds and what they're bringing and when

893
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:15,579
and how and who to talk to

894
00:55:15,579 --> 00:55:19,140
and they all come in and they use a they
use to zal

895
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,160
tooo ZL I'm gonna go pick up a couple
files

896
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,750
I'd love for you guys to take tools lawn
and that

897
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,430
put it on steroids our biggest Rusal is
a set

898
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:35,059
love the tools that fit on a thumbdrive
the kid immediately have you up and

899
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:37,099
running within a local area network

900
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:42,279
anywhere in the world arm sold darpa
funded this under strong angel

901
00:55:42,279 --> 00:55:45,849
and it its it's definitely cool

902
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:49,000
are so civil affairs is

903
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,940
is where I think the future is gonna be
in terms of waging peace

904
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,869
on in we're all gonna have to be very
active the citizens

905
00:55:56,869 --> 00:56:01,049
biggest the reality is when I signed up
to pay taxes

906
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:04,380
I didn't sign up to have my taxes
directed toward waging war

907
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,359
are you know that's where ron Paul
really shines peaceful commerce with all

908
00:56:08,359 --> 00:56:09,170
nations

909
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,140
on and I think over time we need to we
need to do this

910
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,200
is your way for me to get back my
on-screen function

911
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,619
right now I took it away

912
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:27,440
okay good there we go

913
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,359
come on here we go

914
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,700
okay good I'm gonna bring up the the
briefing I gave earlier it's got a

915
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:36,970
couple good sides in a

916
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:43,970
mmm and see with the earth intelligence
network would've been trying to do

917
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:51,410
was create a the frame of reference for
citizens to talk to we also this idea

918
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,819
for policy budget

919
00:56:52,819 --> 00:56:56,558
outreach online thing so that the idea
here

920
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:00,279
is that with volunteer labor every
single

921
00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:04,160
budget at every level the national
budget you guys can all go to the

922
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,700
National online simulation

923
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:09,069
the problem the National online
simulation is although you can create my

924
00:57:09,069 --> 00:57:10,250
budget

925
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:14,029
you can't enter into dialogue with
everybody else

926
00:57:14,029 --> 00:57:17,190
because what you really want to be able
to do is create my budget

927
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:20,660
I'm a libertarian from zip code two 2124

928
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:24,509
and then that allows you to to
immediately see the aggregate budget

929
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:28,710
distinctions between all libertarians
Republicans Democrats and others

930
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:31,920
and then it allows you to go into an
open space and talk about

931
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,059
trade-offs in relation to actual
constraints

932
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,700
on nom on on resources

933
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,400
here I love the slide my son made this

934
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,730
on while you when you mention resources
to you

935
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:53,250
from nor is any similarities between the
car in

936
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:56,289
energy crisis or crisis and

937
00:57:56,289 --> 00:58:00,740
from use the electric crisis California
had

938
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:04,490
hold on that was just pure corruption
here's to zal

939
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,799
mmm which I recommend olive you

940
00:58:07,799 --> 00:58:11,059
it would be a really cool project to
take on to lose all

941
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:15,569
and make it a like he says a an easy to
use tool

942
00:58:15,569 --> 00:58:19,279
that allows for arm

943
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:26,210
hang on see workers by

944
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,839
this was this morning's brief okay think
I've got a

945
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:36,839
a slide analytic tool kits here

946
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,240
there okay in nineteen 86

947
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,190
Diane web a redhead four foot off the
deck

948
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:49,540
thought of this only she thought of it
in the old way the pair middle way

949
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:55,100
and these are all the technology aids
that we need on a standard citizens

950
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:55,730
desta

951
00:58:55,730 --> 00:58:59,750
I mean the the the ones at the top or
ingestion

952
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:03,020
and conversion capabilities

953
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:06,190
the ones in the middle are

954
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:10,020
arm modeling simulation you know
visualization

955
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,360
arm anomaly detection and so forth well
that's actually down in the second like

956
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,010
and then finally last one is sharing and
sensemaking

957
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:22,010
among peers we don't have this today we
don't have this to date because Bill

958
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:26,150
Gates has been migrating and mutating as
application program interfaces

959
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,620
are to discourage innovation on the edge
in the network

960
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:34,359
we don't have this today is Google
doesn't want you to know that they're

961
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,040
stealing everything they touch

962
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,720
and they want you to have their
analytics in their own good time

963
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,430
okay on I think grub distributed search

964
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:49,100
you know that's all possible in my view
when we create information if we had

965
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,630
Cisco whale an application-oriented
network to form of content-based

966
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:57,250
management and control you can change
rules in a nanosecond

967
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:02,550
worldwide but basically your computer
should have a Cisco a lawn

968
01:00:02,550 --> 01:00:06,130
outlet or something like it you should
be able to control your own information

969
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:08,290
you should be able to determine who sees
what

970
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,980
you should be able to audit who sees
what you should be part of a global

971
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:15,310
distributed network where the
information resides permanently

972
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:19,870
in your server nowhere else it's not
mirrored it's got digital watermarks

973
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:24,819
the whole bit we should have this twenty
years ago I was on the original

974
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,720
a advanced information application
program steering group

975
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,330
and we inventoried arm

976
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:36,009
the entire intelligence community we
found out that there were over 20

977
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:39,820
analytic desktop a projects

978
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,990
and each of them was a different party
the intelligence community with a

979
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:45,040
different vendor

980
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,470
with whom they had a sweetheart
relationship with and none of them had

981
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:53,760
standards none of them had even done a
functional requirements analysis I may

982
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,600
be one of the only people on the planet
that's actually done and

983
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,480
and functional requirements analysis for
an analytic work station at CIA

984
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,690
arm and I think it's posted on my
website

985
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:07,210
so this is what we need in open source

986
01:01:07,210 --> 01:01:11,710
software so we need to lose all to be
able to do all this

987
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:15,230
on and also there have to be back and
then reach back centers

988
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:19,000
on one of my dreams is to persuade the
Chinese and the Indians

989
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:23,000
that they need to put homework help on
steroids and basically have

990
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,300
a national call center they hand out
free cell phones first every village

991
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:30,440
sent every neighborhood and every
household like to let you sell the shave

992
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,180
not the razor

993
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,330
so give away the cell phone monetize the

994
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:38,220
analytics how cool is it if sixteen
different farmers call in with the

995
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:38,960
disease

996
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,230
a picture of a disease and your call
center has that plotted

997
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:46,700
or how cool is it is fear farm

998
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,220
if seventeen people call in with
symptoms of SARS

999
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,970
you know I mean what we're talking about
here is turning the cell phone into the

1000
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:56,090
National planet Paul stake

1001
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:01,340
on and I think that's that's for Nokia
is going ok he is very

1002
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,080
very smart they've got this one guy that
what a dream job he travels

1003
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,400
all over the world taking photos of
people in their natural habitats

1004
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,620
and what he's thinking about is how can
a cell phone change the way this person

1005
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,410
does business

1006
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,870
and that was precisely the point I was
trying to make the interval in 1993

1007
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,940
I was invited to give a Friday afternoon
rant and the title love it which is

1008
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,970
online it's it's got man an interval

1009
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:30,110
and what I was saying was if you can't
change the life of an Indian woman

1010
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:34,030
with the child your shit arm

1011
01:02:34,030 --> 01:02:37,440
and instead they were in the Holograms
and all this other stuff

1012
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,450
all let me see if i've got the apart be
slight appear

1013
01:02:41,450 --> 01:02:45,510
home

1014
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:48,640
this is kinda cool I think the tide is
turning

1015
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,339
I think we will be arm well here we go

1016
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:57,400
this is also known as a park be
leadership

1017
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,210
the problem with McCain Obama's they
haven't learned to listen

1018
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:05,740
they haven't learned to ask the right
question and I tried to help Obama and

1019
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:08,660
then I tried to help mccain

1020
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:13,279
inman in McCain's case I mean I I think
McCain strongest point is he's the only

1021
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,990
guy that has the stature to basically
cut the military in half

1022
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:21,580
and that's something we need to do army
we have to cut the military in half

1023
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:28,250
I'll who is talking about a at around

1024
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:32,310
know you're you're right but you also
the gentleman says that McCain sign

1025
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,820
about taking out around

1026
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,840
you know at the end of the day

1027
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,020
Iran is not a threat to United States
America

1028
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:48,020
armed what's at

1029
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:53,930
the fuckin persians yep

1030
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:57,270
I'm not being disrespectful and I hope
you know that

1031
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:01,300
II so he

1032
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,610
let's let's say that we have to decide
between two village idiots

1033
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:08,610
arm know I'd like that

1034
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:11,860
but Bluebird won't talk to me

1035
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:16,130
so I mean Bloomberg sent me a thank you
note her staff sent me think you know

1036
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:20,890
are but I actually put together a a
binder on democracy 2008

1037
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,220
are I've work with some really smart guy
since 2002

1038
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:29,060
identify would you guys like to see a a
nonpartisan cabinet

1039
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:35,380
yes okay then but this slide here this
slide here captures what we're about

1040
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:39,420
I love not asking FX I I'm I'm his
replacement

1041
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:42,770
I

1042
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:46,259
are you know Chomsky got it
manufacturing

1043
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:50,370
consent I mean he really got it long
before the restive usted

1044
01:04:50,370 --> 01:04:53,870
but I don't have tenure anywhere arm

1045
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:58,120
so let me close this down and I'll bring
up the trance partisan cabinet

1046
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:02,410
on and you know I've been thing about
this since 2000

1047
01:05:02,410 --> 01:05:05,250
and I've been working with Michael
Cuddyer hey who was the campaign manager

1048
01:05:05,250 --> 01:05:07,510
for barry goldwater

1049
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:13,040
all home and I spend working with Jock
kill who was a communicator for

1050
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:18,450
president clinton and a whole bunch of
other people and we've come up with

1051
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:21,620
a democracy 2008

1052
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,850
this was this was stuff that I sent to
Bloomberg

1053
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:28,319
arm and it's all available generally

1054
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:34,850
online but here's a coalition cabinet

1055
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:41,850
no I don't think I can make this any
bigger can I

1056
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,800
arm up

1057
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,100
control plus okay there we go our
control plus

1058
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:55,310
hold on I had to find the plus

1059
01:05:55,310 --> 01:05:58,360
alright

1060
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,390
control what I'll

1061
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:07,129

1062
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:14,130
yes I do up

1063
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:18,470
could

1064
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:24,890
yes this is a good idea somebody come up
here and analysts

1065
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:30,210
did everybody get 10 who didn't get fed

1066
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:37,210
no I don't have a mouse religion

1067
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:44,960

yeah yeah new trick okay I will I will

1069
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:51,630
I will leave it there because what
really matters is just this column right

1070
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:52,460
here

1071
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:57,070
but you let me give you my email because
if you find that we've overlooked

1072
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:58,370
somebody

1073
01:06:58,370 --> 01:07:02,380
I would be very very glad to have an
email to bear P E A R

1074
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:07,470
at OS s dotnet in the subject line put
hope in capital letters as the first

1075
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,320
word

1076
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,730
on and I'll be sure to see it I'd love
to have your thoughts on this

1077
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:15,070
but basically what we did was we put
together a slate

1078
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:18,120
that was intended to be nonpartisan

1079
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:22,500
and so you have gym hightower it
agriculture clyde prestowitz

1080
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,940
commerce are with John Bogle

1081
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:29,730
sam nunn at defense up

1082
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:34,240
well my view is that no one should be
elected president the future unless they

1083
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,370
have first announced their cabinet or at
least

1084
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:40,170
you know a partial cabinet and second
published a balance budget where they

1085
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:42,670
intend to take the country

1086
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:46,280
okay because right now we're were voting
people were voting

1087
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,490
foreboding were voting for demagogues
the

1088
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:55,800
with pretentious platitudes that are not
backed up by reality

1089
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:59,290
I'd like to get rid of it on I actually

1090
01:07:59,290 --> 01:08:02,830
I actually have in my in my article on
presidential strategy my chapter

1091
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,170
presidential strategy my first book

1092
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:09,190
I believe we need to deputy vice
presidents a deputy vice president for

1093
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:10,370
national security

1094
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:13,540
who oversees justice state and defense
together

1095
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,390
and a deputy vice president for the
Commonwealth who oversees everything

1096
01:08:16,390 --> 01:08:17,170
else

1097
01:08:17,170 --> 01:08:21,299
I also believe we need to change the
National Council to create a

1098
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:24,880
the a presidential policy staff and I
have a

1099
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,580
concept for director general for policy
director Jennifer strategy

1100
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,109
which we don't have the world's longest
job description was written by David at

1101
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,640
Shari's call preventing World War three

1102
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:39,500
and it was a book-length position
description for a position of council

1103
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,009
president for strategy

1104
01:08:41,009 --> 01:08:44,000
but I've gone much further than that and
thought about how you actually put

1105
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,359
strategy call we call with policy

1106
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:50,190
intelligence and research on

1107
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:53,950
so education Derek Bok energy Paul
Hawken

1108
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:58,689
time cochran Stephen Flynn for the time
being but I think

1109
01:08:58,690 --> 01:09:03,009
as you say Homeland Security needs to be
phased out and what we really need to do

1110
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:05,810
is think about how do you leverage the
Commonwealth

1111
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:11,810
and how do you organize by people by
natural resources and and so forth

1112
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,980
Constanza green a fillup amen

1113
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:18,870
robert kuttner colin powell et state I
think colin powell

1114
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:22,299
should be either vice president or
return to Secretary of State John

stop I have one

1141
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:58,030
yes some listening it's a little
different do give a

1142
01:10:58,030 --> 01:11:01,309
any knowledge Ave project in Alaska

1143
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,020
with feel they've satellite dishes or

1144
01:11:05,020 --> 01:11:08,830
or the one is trying to control the
weather yeah was ripping a hole in the

1145
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:10,630
ionosphere do you have any

1146
01:11:10,630 --> 01:11:14,100
and I'm in for well there is a project
in Alaska that's really person the

1147
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,020
Chinese and the Russians of

1148
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,560
no I forget the detailed name metzger
it's got an 80 in their heart

1149
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,640
yeah Park art rikehart

1150
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,980
H 2 A's H AARP okay

1151
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:31,240
I've read about I've read about it and

1152
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,620
and all I can say is it the arrogance
and ignorance to the US government is

1153
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,780
just

1154
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,599
absolutely utterly astounding arm

1155
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,160
and I think it's a really bad idea

1156
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:49,389
I think it needs to be %uh publicized

1157
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:55,010
arm you know what I said earlier that I
think we need a voice to america

1158
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,990
well this is a real problem here because

1159
01:11:58,990 --> 01:12:02,019
the the government

1160
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:07,000
wants to consider you a trader if you're
willing to listen to other people or to

1161
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,270
collaborate with other people to get the
truth out

1162
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:13,340
arm what said

1163
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,810
he especially for for specialist a
Venezuelan up

1164
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:22,250
well the

1165
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:26,600
the fact of the matter is that will and
Ariel Durant

1166
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,990
in lessons of history which was the
capstone volume on their

1167
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:33,139
their ten to twelve I am history
civilization

1168
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:36,700
are said that morality is a strategic
asset

1169
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:41,950
that is priceless are basically morality
and legitimacy or would allow you to

1170
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:44,190
lower the cost of doing business

1171
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:48,920
and to optimize the degree to which you
can achieve peace and prosperity at the

1172
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:50,910
lowest possible cost

1173
01:12:50,910 --> 01:12:54,050
arm in the United States

1174
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:59,020
has gotten into a series Ulf political
administrations

1175
01:12:59,020 --> 01:13:03,110
who are shameless I mean there's a book
called the trial of Henry Kissinger

1176
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,589
Henry Kissinger murdered

1177
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:09,620
twenty thousand american soldiers by
undermining the Paris Peace Talks

1178
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:14,180
so that nixon could win only to accept
precisely the same terms four years

1179
01:13:14,180 --> 01:13:15,430
later

1180
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:20,390
arm one other concepts that I have is
for retrospective impeachment ce

1181
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:23,860
and I don't mean to impeach in order to
punish

1182
01:13:23,860 --> 01:13:28,059
as much says to warn the current players

1183
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:31,430
on we should be impeaching every senator

1184
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:34,790
that was party to ignoring peak oil

1185
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:39,480
we should be impeaching every senator
today who is refusing to address our

1186
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:40,810
water issues

1187
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:44,990
we should be impeaching every senator
today who declines to institute

1188
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,670
electoral reform

1189
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:50,700
arm it may be too late for this go
around

1190
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:55,090
arm I personally think McCain will win I
personally think

1191
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:58,510
Obama lost me when he rejected the
reverend

1192
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:02,370
because when the reverend said god damn
America

1193
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:06,590
apart from the fact that he was
exercising his right to free speech

1194
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:11,780
he was in fact addressing the sucking
chest wound in our nation

1195
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:16,090
he was addressing the fact that america
is at its weakest when it is at its

1196
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,420
worst

1197
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:23,000
I didn't know that thank you the
gentleman says he was quoting an

1198
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,410
American ambassador

1199
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:28,809
so so the bottom line here is the
reverend was on solid ground and and

1200
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:29,970
when Obama recap

1201
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:33,890
Obama had it right the first time when
he said I could no more reject the

1202
01:14:33,890 --> 01:14:36,170
reverend I could reject my white mother

1203
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:39,470
are and then he blew it he he he blew it

1204
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:44,370
arm so hard needs to be shut down on and
in fact

1205
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:48,500
one of the you know there's a scientific
principle more honored in the breach

1206
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:52,420
and then and in reality but it's called
the precautionary principle

1207
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:56,970
weeee and Charles para wrote a book
called living with Iris technologies and

1208
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:59,060
Scott me if I've said this to any ties
but

1209
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:03,670
simple systems have single points affair
that are easy to diagnose an easy to fix

1210
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:06,910
complex systems have multiple points a
failure that

1211
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:10,620
interact in unpredictable ways on the
way down are very very difficult

1212
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:14,760
6 we have we live in a society

1213
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:20,580
a constellation of complex systems all
built by the lowest better

1214
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:25,100
okay so we're really really bad trouble
and other question on the microphone

1215
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:28,140
ok is not really a question but a
comment when I guess

1216
01:15:28,140 --> 01:15:33,100
commuter trains do a question other
small business with McCain versus

1217
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:36,160
Obama you know out there yet

1218
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:40,510
I E why do I just when abide by them I
just get the feeling we dealing with the

1219
01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:40,960
old

1220
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,080
bucket bucket abuzz with you ghost story

1221
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:48,059
so to speak Vegas sign which one to take
it big drink at after that was right

1222
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,060
because they both represent the two

1223
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:54,690
evil parties and that are trying to shut
out all the other parties and all the

1224
01:15:54,690 --> 01:15:55,880
other thoughts I agree

1225
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,030
day but the other thing is even with
that

1226
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:02,280
iced for some stupid reason I still
can't shake

1227
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:06,190
this so i'd there Obama with all his
fault in their their

1228
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:10,370
still seems to be the lesser of the two
evils now maybe that's incorrect

1229
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:14,790
just adjustable after all about getting
my head around the republic in being a

1230
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:15,600
better choice

1231
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,480
general even though it means less than
it used to you know you know I

1232
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:22,969
sure your pie I share your pain arm

1233
01:16:22,969 --> 01:16:28,969
the the reality the problem that I have
with a bomb I mean I'm

1234
01:16:28,969 --> 01:16:32,440
I'm 56 years old and forty-five not that
much younger

1235
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:35,790
you know I know but i've seen group come
and go and

1236
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:40,420
and Obama unfortunately I think he hit
it before his time

1237
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,840
that's probably true Tom and

1238
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,570
I will tell you I got in my car and I
drove to des moines

1239
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:52,400
and how many of you have already heard
the story alright just a couple of tell

1240
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:53,480
you the story

1241
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:56,750
arm I drove to des moines

1242
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:00,790
because I believed in Obama's
possibilities at the very beginning

1243
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:05,769
and I drove to des moines then I went to
a state office and I try to get them to

1244
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:07,250
pay attention to me and

1245
01:17:07,250 --> 01:17:10,390
and I that pointed out time I just spent
thirty thousand dollars trying to get

1246
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:10,990
them

1247
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:14,150
are some higher-profile with the media
in

1248
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:19,040
Illinois and they blew me off so I went
to the hotel

1249
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:22,600
fairly easy to identify the campaign
hotel I was trying to check in and they

1250
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:25,510
said I'm sorry we're literally sold out

1251
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:29,240
and it was a woman of color and so I
said to us

1252
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:32,830
you know I'm I'm here to try and help
Obama but his staff isn't paying

1253
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:34,809
attention to me he's not reaching out

1254
01:17:34,810 --> 01:17:37,590
I mean he was for a while there he was
mentioning independence and he never

1255
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:38,820
ever mentioned

1256
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,630
libertarians are greens reforms and so i
Sam here

1257
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:45,640
trying to get through to him but his
staff won't listen I'm trying to get to

1258
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,670
them directly she said

1259
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:50,510
just wait a minute and she when she put
me in one of the two rooms block by the

1260
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,870
secret service

1261
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:56,599
on each side of Obama's room and she
didn't tell me that she was doing this

1262
01:17:56,600 --> 01:18:00,990
but now I'm no idiot I get into my room
and I look around and there's a room

1263
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:04,130
right across from me with the door is
cracked it's held hopen

1264
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:08,530
by handkerchief and no one's looking
through the crack but

1265
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:11,700
it's clear to me there couple guys
parked in there I say okay that's the

1266
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,469
secret service from this is my room
that's Obama's from

1267
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:18,790
okay and so then I I E arm

1268
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:24,200
I went down to the business center and I
started preparing a memorandum for

1269
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,730
and by coincidence a man of color who
was on the secret service detail

1270
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:31,170
was in there also I have a year with the
secret service I said you're

1271
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,690
he said he and I said okay well I came
here to slip something under Obama's

1272
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,680
door

1273
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:39,620
which he supposed to prevent arm

1274
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:43,790
I said here's a copy and here's my
social security number

1275
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:47,180
you and i said im in the room right next
door and I'm planning to do this later

1276
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:49,030
tonight

1277
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:52,370
you need in say anything he certainly
did not give me approval

1278
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:56,340
was clearly understood and so later that
night

1279
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:59,780
secret service never noticed could have
been a bomb I put under store

1280
01:18:59,780 --> 01:19:02,990
but the but I put this memo and restore

1281
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:06,090
and he may have glanced at it but Obama

1282
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:10,680
is literally a prisoner have both a
campaign staff

1283
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:15,020
in a political party as well as whatever

1284
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,820
skeletons he has in a Chicago closet and
Obama

1285
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:22,790
is at this point I believe what

1286
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:26,110
reverence of color have said house Negro

1287
01:19:26,110 --> 01:19:29,960
and he's making the same mistake that
colin powell made when he allowed Dick

1288
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:33,190
Cheney to run roughshod over American
foreign policy

1289
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:36,710
and Powell confused loyalty with
integrity

1290
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:40,170
so in my view Obama has

1291
01:19:40,170 --> 01:19:44,270
a bright future only if he finds his own
voice

1292
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:49,670
and only if he separates himself from
doctor strangeloves like brzezinski

1293
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:52,670
presents he's the guy that gave us
Carter

1294
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:57,250
okay burzynski's the guy that gave the
pakistanis a nuclear bomb

1295
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:01,040
presents he's the guy that's been brain
dead for the last ten years

1296
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,450
okay and Obama knows nothing about
foreign policy

1297
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:09,070
he doesn't have I gave him this
structure I slipped this structure under

1298
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,730
store I said memorize a 10 threats
memory set of policies in your when this

1299
01:20:12,730 --> 01:20:14,160
on a walk

1300
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:18,349
and I was blown off by Obama by David
Plouffe a by Axelrod and by Oprah

1301
01:20:18,350 --> 01:20:19,670
Winfrey

1302
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:23,600
are not s what set

1303
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,800
arm the short answer is I'm not sure

1304
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,830
on in McCain's case I may go to Long
personally on the hill

1305
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:38,830
are I faxed it it became began to shine
I thought McCain speech to the NAACP

1306
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:42,310
was the first time he really sounded
presidential

1307
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:46,100
and and thoughtful and reasonable I
thought he actually out did Obama

1308
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:49,730
arm in in that particular body

1309
01:20:49,730 --> 01:20:54,800
are but McCain's problem is that he's
surrounded by a small cadre of staff

1310
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,520
that have come up with them from the
Arizona days

1311
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:01,510
that he's comfortable with that he
trusts I guarantee none of these people

1312
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:03,680
are reading books

1313
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,010
none of these people have multiple
graduate degrees

1314
01:21:07,010 --> 01:21:10,030
none of these people spent their life
living overseas none of these people

1315
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:12,660
have ever experienced poverty

1316
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:16,570
none of these people has a strategic
framework for analysis

1317
01:21:16,570 --> 01:21:20,610
none of these people is capable of
reaching out to David Walker and say hey

1318
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:24,139
McCain needs a balanced budget tomorrow
yes sir

1319
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:28,490
on the microphone a microphone here and
then over there

1320
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:31,570
go ahead as more suggestion anything
else

1321
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:34,889
I'm taking his comment what he said

1322
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:38,090
I if we know that the candidates really
suck

1323
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:41,980
and we really shouldn't be voting for
them why are we voting for them

1324
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:46,500
when we vote for somebody else get well
into the brand loyalty and just

1325
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:50,750
vote for someone who moved to anybody
doesn't matter

1326
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:55,330
I know if to say we're done with the
with Republican done with democrat let's

1327
01:21:55,330 --> 01:21:58,280
let's eat meals on but I don't have a
system is stacked

1328
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,559
right now the system is stacked if you
don't vote

1329
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,830
all you're doing is guaranteeing that
one of them will win with someone else's

1330
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:06,290
I'm not saying not to vote

1331
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:09,210
i'm saying vote for somebody else
Charlotte a live show that there's

1332
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:10,790
interest and you know nader

1333
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:14,140
I'm not a big fan and heater cynthia
mckinney's my my chance I agree with you

1334
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:16,700
and I'm a man after the bathroom in a
few minutes but

1335
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:20,350
but E if I'm it

1336
01:22:20,350 --> 01:22:23,730
yet now look Bloomberg is on the right
track but

1337
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:28,510
I G I flew to Oklahoma to watch
Bloomberg be made a fool of

1338
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:33,520
by David born and the others they had
this so-called bipartisan

1339
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,600
meeting there and I I flew there

1340
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:40,860
and I managed to penetrate the press
corps and I basically got CNN and CBS

1341
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,150
and a couple others to understand

1342
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:46,630
that bipartisan is the opposite of
Trance partisan

1343
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:50,840
okay trance partisan his leftist term
nonpartisan as the moderate rightist

1344
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,469
term

1345
01:22:51,469 --> 01:22:55,620
but I i I was told that in the private
press conference before the public one

1346
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:57,400
several people asked him hey

1347
01:22:57,400 --> 01:23:01,590
you know this is bipartisan two parties
what about trance partisan all parties

1348
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:05,719
and there was no answer and Bloomberg's
actor on the stage and I've published a

1349
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:07,510
memorandum on this which is online

1350
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:12,000
about Bloomberg being made a fool of an
Oklahoma basically you had

1351
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,570
the david boren show and with the
exception a sam nunn

1352
01:23:15,570 --> 01:23:19,540
and Bloomberg everybody there was a
has-been including

1353
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,410
colon okay going back to the coming
about Obama

1354
01:23:23,410 --> 01:23:28,680
if Obama is elected he will be castrated
from day one

1355
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,620
with respect to national security he'll
end up trying to bring in someone like

1356
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,590
sam nunn

1357
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:37,060
and people just gonna go through the
motions and he is gonna be stonewalled

1358
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,520
everywhere he goes

1359
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:42,400
he is going to end up finding out that
he's got a pic 1 domestic thing and do

1360
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,060
that and he's not going to change the
system

1361
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:48,420
arm McKay may be the same

1362
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:51,630
it in in my personal in my personal view

1363
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:56,540
and and I had a slide in there I would
be thrilled if Bloomberg

1364
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:02,340
would say that he was not going to run
for president but that he was going to

1365
01:24:02,340 --> 01:24:06,060
launch a a a nationwide effort

1366
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:09,810
so that his chosen representative would
participate in every single one of the

1367
01:24:09,810 --> 01:24:11,540
presidential debates

1368
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:16,870
and Bloomberg should field eight people
sunshine cabinet

1369
01:24:16,870 --> 01:24:20,590
and that sunshine cabinet working under
webcams

1370
01:24:20,590 --> 01:24:24,190
an online should create a balanced
budget

1371
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:28,660
that the people can discuss and we
should do all this beginning 1 September

1372
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,380
an ending no later than 15 October

1373
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:36,560
if Bloomberg would pay for that he will
do it loaded lou dobbs will never do

1374
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:40,390
he will raise the levels debate he will
make everybody conscious of all the

1375
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:41,100
issues

1376
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:45,240
he will make these two guys realize what
fools they are it's the pro to get

1377
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:49,150
ha it's what ross perot dirty papers on
advertising all Rus yeah but no

1378
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,640
excuse me ross perot was about ross
perot

1379
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:57,290
right ross perot had no strategy he had
no policy panel

1380
01:24:57,290 --> 01:25:01,820
he had no pallets budget all ross perot
wanted to do was be ross perot

1381
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:05,830
any fire he was able to hire the two
best political consultants on both sides

1382
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:06,600
of the aisle

1383
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:10,250
and they both quit because ross perot
would listen well neither does ralph

1384
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,180
nader

1385
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:14,620
okay on so right now the

1386
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:19,059
dark horse in all this is blown Burke
and Bloomberg is reputed to have said

1387
01:25:19,060 --> 01:25:22,120
with absolute fervor he's not gonna run
why should he run

1388
