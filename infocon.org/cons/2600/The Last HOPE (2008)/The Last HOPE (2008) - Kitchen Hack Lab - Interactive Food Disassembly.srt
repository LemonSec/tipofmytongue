you know there's something like there's
one percent ove food rivals available

45
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,609
now

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,280

47
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,019
up with the vessels are totally gone now
because they're just gonna go tomatoes

48
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:43,780
because they

49
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,000
you know tomatoes are the shapes that
are that there could be put in cans

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,090
service we getting rid of a lot of food
and Solaris culture that is gross think

51
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:50,459
so

52
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:53,610
this is described this desert really
quick before we pass it out a

53
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:00,610
you guys come up

54
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,140
up

55
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:24,859
okay sir is going to set up this is a

56
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,159
this is a summary cake with us so sure
it's all right on top of it as a celery

57
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,929
seed %uh

58
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,639
glaze on in it as well and there's also
a at the time frosting ever have

59
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,379
a liquid nitrogen kinda sorta really
cure on top of it a sub many over to

60
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:38,939
think so

61
00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:43,260
%uh this really gets going to accelerate
the same here like celery root they were

62
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,959
never heard of celery root burger

63
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,159
are beautiful so solar you know it's a
big nah beefing with sorry going out a

64
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:52,450
bit and you can make a carrot cake out a
bit it's really nice a cabinet to turn

65
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:52,819
so

66
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,959
we said we need this one not this one
desserts to go back to my notes for

67
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,510

69
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,379
there was a I'm there was a is for
sellers have the celery seed

70
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,840
cracker bread and then a celery
pressured so we're inside a bit

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,500
and we have to use tools making the Sony
rick rack or so to see cracker bread

72
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
and we had a you know celery leaves
inside if its sole reroute shredded and

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,030
the Minnesota hard vinaigrette had tied
it together in the foot

74
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,610
troubles on top of course so it's like
four different guys the seller is kinda

75
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,020
like

76
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,250
export cuz other day work growth having

77
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,000
comments 0

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,139
pretty nice right so no senate bring
back that flavor

79
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:39,389
so little I am better I talk notes Louis
reduction about me I'm a hacker chef

80
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,800
their ass here hacker chef way more the
last time

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,870
good job guys so hacking is a lot like
science a

82
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,460
I guess what like I've cooking I think
server computers offer for a while

83
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,960
and when I get sick about a kinda go
into cooking mode right because you can

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
get a regular suffer from bizarrely
accessible

85
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,490
a lot to people who aren't computer
freaks right you can write this offer

86
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,630
for a girl or boy are we ever going to
having sex with

87
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,539
and maybe he'll be impressed with it
maybe for the right person but not

88
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,620
usually right but if you if you make
someone a meal it's like a chemical

89
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:09,610
assault on them right it's like you're
releasing serotonin in the brain and

90
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,070
stuff like that so I can to get sicker
food and go back to computers get sick

91
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,500
appears go back to fix stocks gonna be
kinda like

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,020
about those who kinda things combined I
have some work at a restaurant

93
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,570
certificates go over to russia call the
Fat Duck Inn um

94
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,789
enough in England's its have a molecular
gastronomy place are

95
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:29,159
work in the lab there so we had you know
I've vacuum chambers in centrifuges you

96
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:32,400
period tomato put it in spirit at
4000rpm have a puffin

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,029
no tomato at the bottom of the pigment
the thread and flavor on top

98
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:39,760
siphon that often make a tomato sorbet
whites made a sorbet says like a lot of

99
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,550
weird science the stuff video vacuum

100
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,050
um that keep us hooked up to other
things right seek Me cooking something

101
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,219
withdraw all the air out of it %uh so
that

102
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:51,639
your meringues go up extra high right
because there's a vacuum inside Minister

103
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:52,570
commit suicide

104
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,229
up

105
00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:02,919
this

106
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,089
start so

107
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,990
up whenever you start with other
connection stuffs it is going to pour

108
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,409
some liquor

109
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,459
russians this bowl I and we have this
%uh

110
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:16,929
egg whites a celery like your phone that
since who knows what this is

111
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:23,929
hook

112
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,209
so you can you surprise you can you have
a brain cells remember to raise your

113
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,740
hand so I'm sure many of us a lot many
brain cells to nitrous oxide but

114
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,770
actually has a cone are you switch is
that it's

115
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:35,808
you really quickly a reading something
and then chilling as well

116
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:39,749
so if we feel that a nitrous I fed up
with egg whites and

117
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:44,249
so we really cure and we're going to a
at Carphone it up onto

118
00:06:44,249 --> 00:06:48,139
a spoon it to be this nice puffy thing
about whites surely many cousins are all

119
00:06:48,139 --> 00:06:50,059
right the way to cook the egg whites

120
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:53,339
in liquid nitrogen expect russians 1991
agrees it's we're going to

121
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,409
there we go like a nice right there ID
nature's the protein over egg whites

122
00:06:57,409 --> 00:07:00,159
right actually coagulate sec'y proceed
so it cooks it

123
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:04,289
by super freezing it right so up to be
really nice we have these will pass on

124
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,110
top of these things

125
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,169
as soon as that uses those are ready as
soon as bomb

126
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:12,049
so what up over there just a pic to time
to start passing out everyone you can

127
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,919
so got a hundred plates so under I'm
people in this room trying get whatever

128
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,688
yeah I'm trent fight where the front if
you want she was really really good so

129
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,879
arduous Logan article okay so talk a
little bit more about why I look at the

130
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,289
unico precinct 13

131
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:29,909
arduous veggie hunters would be
inappropriate in 13 anybody else

132
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:33,058
that's kinda but it's going to happen
goodness get its good hacker bed and

133
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:33,749
breakfast

134
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:38,399
it since Erin Cisco California it some
miss if I can minimize the store through

135
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:39,860
it there's some pictures of it

136
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,509
this is the Red Room we have a bus
people cast a their rights of wearing

137
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:46,319
coat the kitchen prefer pretty proud of
it sincerity

138
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,039
this goes a cookbook shelf at 180 190
cookbooks I

139
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,188
the summer the quicker we have
indications beautiful mural at so your

140
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,569
precinct 13 is kind of

141
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:57,610
others are seen rack there's awesome job
ran to the Supper Club

142
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,990
repairing our vacuum press so your
corporate security is kinda but when the

143
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,839
process we have another through talking
so every

144
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:06,999
Thursday night 5 to 35 people come over
and we all cook dinner together

145
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:10,180
right and I and we have like in a
centrifuge back in chamber all is kinda

146
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,289
crazy stuff liquid nitrogen stuff so
it's

147
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,818
its opportunity for people to cook
together and like express that communal

148
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:16,519
a static

149
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:19,680
instead going to a restaurant you know
where you working your people have maybe

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,379
what they don't really like their jobs

151
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:25,389
made only like you as a as as a customer

195
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:31,760
weeks ago

263
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,970
so we have a a black custard right which

264
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,490
cream import blood

265
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,189

a faith registering gots add up but

270
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:19,709

means black custard is it this is

271
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,169

00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,089
here for I had so we work with zero
throng and

274
00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:32,120
we had a run dinner we try to make as
many gross things as possible

275
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,819
you're right fell out so good

276
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:40,230
Strix strictures frozen self %uh okay so
we had a ride in a row which is what

277
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,899
about if I find myself running what it
meant a lot to gross food

278
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,439
we had a durian we have this is black
oil card with a black olive oil right

279
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,748
which is you know we we took a much
peace with olives cut in half

280
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:54,790
bomb demand five changes water with
splash in with a boiling water to come

281
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,139
to get the briny flavor out

282
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:59,759
and we put him in a dehydrator so that
the olive oyl the water we go lassie had

283
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,850
just like at a pure fat and solids and
what's that with olive oil

284
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,180
you have like not the most if I'd black
olive oil but a real black olive oil

285
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,050
as we can about with poached this black
hot in that by showing up a little CV

286
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,160
like vacuum bag with the SCOTUS oil on
canvas really slowly cooked it

287
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,759
so well we have some other gross stuff a
rotten I am this is the concert this is

288
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:21,619
a durian a 10 durian fruit is

289
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:25,449
growth writer yeah I would have also
accepted courts

290
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,040
up office was like art but it goes
really well with pecan pie

291
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,360
right for some reason so that's that's
what we did the black custard right

292
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,779
and then the we had some %uh this blood
custard we actually had some leftover in

293
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:37,449
the fridge

294
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:40,369
and I cuz I want to try and make a I'm
kinda crimper layout never know

295
00:15:40,369 --> 00:15:42,059
September layers right

296
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,040
to respect a little bit of sugar on top
it was cold cuts for state and tastes

297
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,819
exactly like a scab

298
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:51,110
you know is as I as is cold and

299
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,790
tastes like iron kinda really heavy I it
was a healthy pig

300
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,998
the giver but their blood to this so
that was a bad idea right so

301
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,079
there that's that's one of things about
half a dozen or so you're messing

302
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,589
messing around stuff in the kitchen
because sipping a hacking is attacking

303
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:04,410
is just

304
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,860
getting as much as you can about a
system trying to figure out things to do

305
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,139
with the no one's ever done before

306
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,779
same thing with food sitting with
dancing same thing with sex I think

307
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:11,980
anything you can really hack

308
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,119
it so as are high cuz we gotta sit down
and say what are some long things we can

309
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:16,040
do with food

310
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,349
like I we had a a warm wood we had a New
Orleans real time so we like

311
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,889
organic were Woodman it's right and make
a bar with a TS out

312
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,209
was horrible is really is totally are
notable but we did some other good but

313
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,240
you know you learn from those things
right that's the whole point

314
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,249
love I've kind of succeeding learning in
the world is being able to fail in

315
00:16:32,249 --> 00:16:33,740
setting yourself up to fail

316
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,170
um so I'd guess we're talking about the
vegan bloody attack labs

317
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,889
so we have these a.m. with the poor
happy to see a lack of subs in Seattle

318
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,350
I had dinner up their way up there for
Thanksgiving we made a big introduction

319
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,429
right the turducken as everyone knows is
the chicken stuff so the Ducks of that

320
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:50,730
sort of the Roman recipe

321
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,629
where they keep going up to a cow right
and then inside the Finch

322
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:57,959
and the truffle inside fishing if the
truffle and sacrifice the rest is

323
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:58,959
illusory

324
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,889
it's alright because the ramen that's
how they roll their decade in a spike

325
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,649
they're like

326
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:06,138
yeah I there that's what they do. my
right and that is anyone here knows

327
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:06,970

336
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,309
by the way

337
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,168
billion cigarettes hands the other thing
I hate about vegan food

338
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:41,879
but but but I love is the is that is the
trying to make a fake meat fingers

339
00:17:41,879 --> 00:17:43,520
vigils best food is so good right

340
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,418
just wanna jump in to make the
vegetables awesomely and we do that of

341
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,659
course by roasting the hell outta me
burn hella

342
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:51,770
03 like steamed brussel sprouts and
roasted brussel sprouts are steamed corn

343
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:52,690
roasted corn

344
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,679
we rose the things you make is mired
flavors which is an amino acid reducing

345
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,309
sugar

346
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,139
kinda exploding into is beautiful rose
tea tasting things that's why of course

347
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:00,940
you had

348
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,730
wine to make a sauce when you're so when
you doing a steak or something or for

349
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,990
Vegas you doing it you know

350
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,190
so for over one yr I usually try to get
the brown flavor of

351
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,840
I really much I talk shit about because
I love other forgiving if it better

352
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,020
but unit raided that brown stuff the top
to bottom up and back into the thing

353
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,850
right

354
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,149
so it's like i know it. class or
whatever so with his big mac labs up in

355
00:18:19,149 --> 00:18:19,809
Seattle

356
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:23,330
with the Saddleback lab is all about
coffee and salmon we had a vacuum

357
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,340
chamber here people come people came and
brought some really interesting hardware

358
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:30,250
is a ball roasters they would have their
balls reston there's a ball roasters

359
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,240
so a ball roaster right there is a its
code you know in the fields of you know

360
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,340
Venezuela Brazil or whatever you can to
throw

361
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,490
your YouTube you can harvest the the
coffee beans you have for a couple the

362
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,179
roaster

363
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:42,840
so for some propane in the paddock up
your coffee right there's people who

364
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
were with a friend

365
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,389
at the summer attack but that was a
roster for so good so he brought his

366
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,179
ball he made a bicycle powered espresso
machine

367
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:52,730
right and so it's hard hard espresso
machine for the major for boarding

368
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,270
membrane matrix they wanted you

369
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,610
they want their espresso in Mill the
desert that's what they want to Burning

370
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,690
Man pretty epic that's one of the desert

371
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,580
it's a bicycle powered space machine
that builds up the pressure that you

372
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,290
need right

373
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,230
to make that steam on so what part that
was a bicycle powerball roster and so

374
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:10,040
we were we bought a vacuum chamber and
we've got some essential oils right

375
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,350
as we had we have three times over
coffee beans we had like

376
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,020
sumatra in Colombia and and I'm and
Ethiopians

377
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,869
and we kind of did little tests with
this with these coffees we kinda like

378
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:20,889
wat about Cup Tim

379
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:24,470
and we put the green beans in a vacuum
chamber while they're still very nice to

380
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,450
have some water in them

381
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:28,850
with a essential oil so we have like you
know bergamot essential oil

382
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:32,559
and I'm a camp for such oil which
castles like mothballs

383
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,678
right and we rose to these beans after
week so we're kinda during tests on

384
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,730
which these beings tasted good with
different subs a man has a gun

385
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:47,360
yet yet yet through it for the rest of
the night researcher

386
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,750
about South home leave your haircut come
if you've had the cake so far

387
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,850
what do you think beautiful

388
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,030
jolson Mason isn't there someone nitrous
don't lead Virginia

389
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,710
of so so out so

390
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,570
we basically took these green coffee
beans back in time with them with

391
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,389
essential oils and the roasted in to see

392
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,619
how that affected the flavor over kinda
cut them all in stride and Mike

393
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:14,908
the columbia beans Rd had like an for
notes and so it was interesting as you

394
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:17,030
drink the coffee but your mouth what
kind of cool down

395
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,379
picture this I can for flavor in it and
Ethiopian already had a

396
00:20:20,379 --> 00:20:23,679
you can be is already had some citrus
notes it's the bergamot religious a good

397
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,290
with that we also had a roaster we had a
a garbage can

398
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:30,330
a smoker rather it so easy to the beans
as the

399
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,070
smoking material for salmon so we have
like if European coffee smoked salmon

400
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,899
and Colombian coffee smoked salmon

401
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:39,720
to go to trial those two we have took
took notes which are on this wiki page

402
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,210
right

403
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:44,129
residents like really interesting I'm
kinda sugar taxes because the cuban shot

404
00:20:44,129 --> 00:20:47,369
Seattle ever goes crazy a copy but I
sprinkled with sugar on top

405
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:50,780
espresso brown support through it makes
a sweeter so little research the reading

406
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,210
at Powell's Books & up what about what
sugars

407
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,110
are in coffee right it's mostly group
because a percussive the main ones right

408
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,190
as of course we put table sugar a true
that sucrose it's not that some good

409
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,470
cause but sucrose right

410
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,220
and so we tried with a budget for sugar
so here's because he was sugars we use

411
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,470
we can last a couple of them

412
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,850
and we tried and we did like I'd never
had coffee before despite my life by the

413
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,139
way so we literally have like making
copies

414
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,320
and I was up for about nine days and

415
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,689
but only if they're found with the
bathroom a it was them

416
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,629
and what does that so so we try to
Russia for sugars and we found out that

417
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:24,350
like it was so happy for toes have come
ice MacOSX

418
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,760
really tasted nice and sweet but like
coffee sweet right

419
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,000
wasn't actually the section are being
added to this thing such a cool idea

420
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,139
somehow clubs and I'm

421
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:36,350
a record American use do you just you
just go to store and get some stuff you

422
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,549
are a mess with you say

423
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:41,530
you go get a bus a Brazilian design for
its all the rage now like I say Inc as

424
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,580
you use go get 'em on havel testing
testing trying to stuff with them

425
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,820
and I should look at our wiki about to
some the other hand claps ok it's this

426
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,450
kind of

427
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,799
talk a bit about and again you're
documenting something right document and

428
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:52,790
sharing which is

429
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,780
restaurants don't do that right the very
secret about the recipe is now go to

430
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,480
work at the restaurant maybe learn the
stuff that's the difference between

431
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,429
Calif your feedback and less work at the
fact that you go in just one dollar

432
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,740
plate restaurant you go in as a guy with
a Ruby on his forehead right

433
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,909
it's like how how did poor people get
that food right and have those recipes

434
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,710
get out there for other people use and
so that's kinda what we're about as far

435
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,460
as a

436
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,530
open source recipe development and also
made a bunch zines we have

437
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:19,750
I'm here magazines present since anyone

438
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,899
and rosie is years of the Nazarene are
get so we are you know we we kinda busy

439
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:24,990
it's a fairly stable

440
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:28,369
each each dinner we have but right the
menu in it I

441
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:34,879
it has not left just pass it with a
thrust the KKS its if its current

442
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:39,980
what's a pleasant applique tools

443
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,450
butter archer time right

444
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,409
it so it's butter icing sugar and time
time syrup that he made

445
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:50,990
yesterday in Brooklyn the Brooklyn made
dessert yes another

446
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:54,899
a so I which will make scenes for the
dinner parties are we

447
00:22:54,899 --> 00:22:57,480
can write the menu in there and kinda
pass around every with a dinner party

448
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,309
and say

449
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:01,309
you write your favorite dish in a week
ago back in kinda see what our favorite

450
00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:02,668
but a favorite meals were

451
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:05,919
um so we've talked a bit about the
reclaiming celery aspect to this

452
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,840
which is I never I tried this is where
this that when those are kinda care that

453
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,820
when this kinda came from

454
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,418
it actually did you sell it at all the
aspects of solar the seed the route

455
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,409
the hearts and early years but it
actually have celery in it and so I

456
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:17,149
think a

457
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,330
its in terms of industrial revolution
kind of destroying access to food

458
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,019
I would come if you live in California
now on couple people

459
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:27,529
so coming to california produces so much
for the country's produce right

460
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:30,779
that's how much fuel is being used to
drive california produce to the rest of

461
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:31,730
the country a lot

462
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,029
right and so that's like one that you
know ways we get off oil dependence

463
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:38,630
is why I'm sure um bicycle Marcus
talking about this too is you have

464
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,950
local gardens have you know to victory
garden its right victory garden right

465
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,860
what you have the better guards were
there were two 15 million

466
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,779
several 15 million gardens

467
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:53,919
rates fifteen million gardens and then
war is over

468
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,059
you don't need it anymore rights people
growing their food trading it for and

469
00:23:57,059 --> 00:23:58,580
that's that's is usually in I ca

470
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:02,850
enormous thing and then only be here for
have been so I have been a harlem

471
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,960
right over eighty percent diabetes rate
if there was that

472
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,840
because when you go to store to go to
the corner store to get snapple and

473
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,649
ships

474
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,710
in a sec accessed organic food access to

475
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,480
I to healthy food right that so actually
want to reiterate I'm should last talked

476
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,860
a lot about that a lot

477
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:21,600
was about that a lot as the idea food
justice the idea that people

478
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,309
that social justice is directly related
to people's access to health the

479
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:27,049
people's access like good food

480
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,399
I really recommend US checking out um
right is hungry dot com

481
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:34,080
for some videos a fight people West ok
we kinda retaking plots of land and

482
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,699
growing stuff there and doing things on
top in elementary schools

483
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,760
I alright cool so they were talking
about about the set up the equipment

484
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,158
would be working on this equipment is
actually

485
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:46,850
kind of working past the prototype model
yet but you know

486
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,740
it's really fun in the kitchen equipment
and really I meet people your hardware

487
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,289
hackers

488
00:24:52,289 --> 00:24:56,879
bureau was after their decent

489
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,590
well so I so we got some friends that we
do some hardware hacking right sizes in

490
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,658
Japan for a while

491
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:05,620
I have searched the pictures from Japan

495
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,559
and the add water to make a stock out a
bit because you're paying for those corn

496
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,269
cobs and corn us why should you get the
flavor out of them

497
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:23,190
this is a this is Japan rose a penny to
I'm even open you know as

498
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,809
writes the it's the fact that the flakes
issues for me so soup this is a

499
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:30,129
Cecere benito tataki this kid right here

pitch fork with one hand over firing

501
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,960
strike strong

502
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,370
with the other as the best thing I ever
had and to make it that way for three

503
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,320
thousand years or someone like enright

504
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,059
it's of course history pictures got
Burger score severity

505
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:47,649
got a house in English in there at New
Years Eve I obvious virgins at the

506
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,090

508
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,440
this is beautiful but like seven the
morning snowing beautiful bowl

509
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,789
up soup all these like little lady is
right here eating at near in the snow

510
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:04,460
trying to like sell their stuff I
remember was signed as a friend for

511
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,200
saying it

512
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,179
oh yeah I'm so it depends added some
dinner parties there

513
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:12,940
am i suffering is like what are you
using a whisk for to make a man is

514
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,940
should use chopsticks their hair done
chopsticks in to make man as I fiber

515
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,940
right 78 minutes with their bodies

516
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,410
here place its person is

517
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,560
um spillover

518
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,139
saucer with you may commence and when
you know we're making a man is

519
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,630
ago can't get a cup of oil or something
like that you're going to make any

520
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,230
modifications being web

521
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,850
above protein and fat and air you could
have a concise many Z

522
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,170
little bit easier to do with chopsticks
actually right and actually actually

523
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,030
fixes it

524
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,810
if you because you break it sometimes
there is to do it with with and metals

525
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:53,540
are touching your food bamboo touching a
field which is little nicer

526
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:56,550
to the site giving of ions right just
leaving splinters in it

527
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,030
so so I go back and I love it 7 Cisco

528
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,770
what's a good thing about San Cisco
vibrator stores on every corner

529
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,900
so good vibrations there are no good
vibrations is subject good vibrations so

530
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,010
I go up in a game on his hand things are
kinda moves with a hand and our basic

531
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,460
all calling about putting a

532
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,660
a potentiometer on its you can turn it
up and clamping

533
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,890
chopsticks on to added its

534
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,170
its contents of whisker any you busy
holding someone else's hands and turning

535
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,320
up the thing and whisking

536
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,590
but you have to her hand whisking
actually it's just would

537
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,150
and with such if you're not metal sucks
I kinda weird equipment can talk but

538
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,250
some other equipment axe

539
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,790
I am this what the this is one that is
that so far gone

540
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:41,040
right well I was I was a cake again you
guys gonna

541
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,290
very good are beautiful

542
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,350
if so another with his friend with
friends oz is doing this show protect

543
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,030
this with the

544
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:53,460
little Joey Graham kingpin he say when
he read those people your night

545
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,360
US is helping us are make a centrifuge
with up and so centrifuges spinning

546
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,020
something really super fast really

547
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:03,750
and you have 'em Wesley its it's a
centrifuge for peace cafe

548
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,260
so with thing about suspicious you're
changing the density of the liquid and

549
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,060
so is a metal plate glass centrifuge

550
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,610
see put like you know different kinds
alcohol in it and it gets them up two

551
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,830
different densities you can make abuse
cafe

552
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,949
are a lot a layered rate with arbitrary
alcohol's

553
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:21,160
reich is only when you make a drink with
RGB right with the RGB

554
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,970
it's a shot after shot

555
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:28,520
green its mature E Missouri curse out

556
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,240
and reading aftershock after so its RGB

557
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,260
you're ready you right yeah

558
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,660
well says you know if you guys are
running RGB wow that you'll be poured

559
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,650
RGB shots at the

560
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,460
at the barn Irakli receiving so you a
couple will respond to your like relate

561
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,090
on the density the things to kinda layer
up but you can change the density the

562
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,210
same to the centrifuge

563
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,940
so the pie class maybe so they will have
it ready for by the cocktail

564
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,730
I'm Festival in Austria whatever so you
can actually kinda dial-up

565
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,950
out what layers are you want your
alcoholic drink to be

566
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:01,310
what some other stuff out the Bellagio
411 Blasio

567
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,950
sousa to ceramic bowls the Fountains at
the Bellagio right the ceramic bowl full

568
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,550
of holes drilled into it hooked up to

569
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,169
a a dental irrigator I'm a beard brush
your teeth

570
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,470
its rear and how did you hear is that
all your Gators

571
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,110
with delegate is awesome the best ever
do with alligators

572
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:23,350
the a tougher how accessible for saying
she flew above marshmallow

573
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,560
doe I am

574
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:30,250
whatever and then and then and then you
write something in cursive

575
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,080
and then you took the marshmallow and
it's a cursive marshmallow changing

576
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,699
colors

577
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:37,950
so should check that out 35 anyway so a
to the blah Jubail has your Gator

578
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,820
and basically a has a large has RGB
LED's around the edges the ball

579
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,350
and then the poor and you're like really
nice corn consomme have your concert or

580
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,580
something like that and it can you turn
on it starts breaking into the ball

581
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,919
with a lil RGB LED light show it's very
pretty your

582
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,840
so that's cool what else are you a
vacuum old sieves I don't have a picture

583
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,130
this either but it's a

584
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,420
a sieve is like you have an its so many
poor something through

585
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,760
um to you know strain at six training
get nice medical-grade comment about

586
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,020
such a great sister like

587
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,810
you may be micron 30 micron you know
peace is a fat don't go through it

588
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,129
season that's ok but you classically you
just gotta rub something to the civil

589
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:15,720
trial use

590
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,190
a vacuum I'm pumped to suck the thing
through this if rights using a vacuum

591
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:20,760
forms

592
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,629
a back if one thing I can you talk a

food games how do you know it's a

595
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:28,890
realism is

596
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,910
are beautiful a so I need

597
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:37,610
canyons here like three as

598
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,160
yet and one more person anybody yeah

599
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,530

604
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,170
he's a food on

605
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,440
folded over and give it to the next
person right and then

606
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,250
and then keep and then so that you won't
be able to see what you wrote forces

607
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:07,560
going right pizza food on it and pass it
to the next person

608
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,990
and that can go in a circle and then
will undo it also is something kinda

609
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,920
interesting about so

610

oh yeah don't stock exchange kinda
rotate

620
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,790
yet you pass the office and has a man
around to the other side so never feel

621
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,100
never you got it are else okay if you
could fail

622
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,170
just write something really random so
that is like surrealist few games like

623
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,920
exquisite corpse even though it's what
the court says

624
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,520
30 scam we say starter is people saying

648
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,680
that's a the perfect weather here is
that you kinda jumping outside your

649
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,910
comfort zone you're just you're sticking
around impairing

650
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:34,020
because and salsa adult wanted this was
a corpse's its expressing

651
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,010
the cup the collective aesthetic right
where of people are standing in a group

652
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,590
have saying words as the words that will
come to them because they're

653
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,660
you know an article in our group for
whatever the same thing with people in a

654
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,180
kitchen

655
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,710
because say here's a random things right
thing and thing I've learned from doing

656
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,380
this game in

657
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,380
have making dinner dinner parties based
on this game

658
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,530
is I am that up hmm everything goes with
everything

659
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,410
that's the trick man laws or something
that connects it to something else

660
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:02,930
right so there's that this despite the
fact that those mango and pine right

661
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,530
and and the trick is that it's gotta
it's not a suspect senator peanut Corp I

662
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:07,050
need

663
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:11,100
that's characteristic flavor pine
needles right but is also in some mangos

664
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,549
that's when you see it yes there's this
thing that ties together ties the mega

665
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,770
together with the pine you have a6
energy in your mouth

666
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,780
I guess a back to the coaches a service
which ripped off my toenail

667
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,360
I salt it down drafted rambled of the

668
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,650
germ of the little the some a layer of
its very thin

669
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,210
and using that to flavor a milk and the
kind of growing the cheese

670
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:35,659
of %uh the toenail and it's in progress
right now and we can imagine this is a a

671
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,040
we can imagine this is a to service
thing right you go up and say we made

672
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,560
our mister like Santoshi it's you know
come back in a month

673
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:45,340
and use rip off the toenail for service
and you travel down but

674
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,320
but does she really like the taste of
your own toes right so my guess is 30 is

675
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,520
pain of those very alright so for
set/sets what experiments we have we

676
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,980
also I'm

677
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:59,430
%uh this is kinda gross a chocolate
occupy me know on chemo its

678
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,819
right it's like the former officials
monkfish liver right

679
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,850
and it's pretty nice and so we have much
among fish liver

680
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,339
and I thought well you know how how mice
with that be if we ended up arm

681
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,390
soaking it with chocolate so we got this
other macadamia oil and the dive shop

682
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,430
for the Cure

683
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,350
as this is my first love right there and
we kind of got married it with that

684
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,880
and then ended up stealing it like
normal like in a in a couple calls and

685
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,810
wrap in foil

686
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,670
and is your chocolate flavored liver is
a cover something like when you talk

687
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,760
with infoguía

688
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,820
there's a lot of adding this the fat is
campaign together the mouthfeel

689
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,490
so by the way it's gross up

690
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,160
but now you got you got to learn those
things are %uh this is interesting this

691
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,129
is kinda messing with

692
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,630
isopropyl have some TV here I'm patent

693
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,800
experiment with making drugs a beer but
we have sex our website about

694
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,900
this is this we can make cash by you at
isopropyl alcohol so I can we leaves

695
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,860
and you can have like let it sit for a
couple days and boiled off on electrics

696
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,470
servant on electric stove if what I
ventilation you have it you can making

697
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,000
hash

698
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,470
as we're doing that with wormwood
mugwort and talk to be in

699
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,990
as we kinda would cover the worm or the
mug worker they are kinda covered

700
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,020
a and then you can strain it and you
have this kind really dark green merkich

701
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,430
murky liquid and any kind of took it
down electric stove

702
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,440
that starts a kind of like precipitating
out at the solution by called and what's

703
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,550
precipitating out is

704
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,720
to show right and here we have this
block is too short cycle tori black ash

705
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,720
and so you can smoke that girl you know
you luv so

706
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,280
so you know the ideas you have doing
things with I am

707
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,130
with through that you know you have an
intended so it's K using isopropyl to

708
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:35,370
there's an interesting drug actually the
same thing it's in it since eight its

709
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,450
molecules and sage this must be the
active ingredient absence but who knows

710
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,540
and Italian you know you have a bit
interesting drug in

711
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,810
with people talk about a little bit
later she has a new so the party rock so

712
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,040
them when the other ones a primary
reference book called after the answer

713
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,150
at Akron the ants

714
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,620
right so the food hacker in the ass
right so these are antivenom gumdrops

715
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,009
so I'm if you're given its come on

716
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,180
there you go raise your little bit see
you know that that really sharp kinda

717
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,690
sour flavor we actually went to an
insect place

718
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,680
receiving a member the URL to this this
rare

719
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,020
now it's maybe there's a dash in it now
it's not if

720
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,740
where can i cum service

721
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,520
rate area of

722
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,210
to it as insects place in the into

723
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,540
Santa Monica Airport of all places
called typhoon up is there a meeting a

724
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,180
cockroach

725
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,379
and it's a you notice like shit of
course frost is like man it's right so

726
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,250
they could you've got to think about the
actor that

727
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,280
you stuff it with bananas maybe you deep
fry it and the PLO powdered sugar on its

728
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:38,830
like a roach

729
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:42,270
manana funnel cake you know it's like a
little in a kinda bring someone back to

730
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:42,790
that kinda

731
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:46,980
idea %uh so we ate ANSWER Answer really
nice take the catch is like sweet are to

732
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,700
have any minute as formic acid

733
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,040
and that Apple for me is the sum is this
I would you add ethanol to that and it's

734
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,590
the characteristic flavor raspberries in
San taste from

735
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:58,590
so a we made this gum drops our

736
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,970
151 and then these raspberries are kind
of soap and shampoo or does the black

737
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,950
raspberry liqueur

738
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:07,400
and limiters gum drops on 151 and we
kinda blaze the top ovett

739
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:11,280
and with the torch and rockets on top of
it and so when you get this you actually

740
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,570
this is a much to read record it happen
dance

741
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,770
us with your you tasting at venom right
but you're also facing alcohol

742
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,330
and eating raspberries are testing rum
say this is kinda some other weird

743
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:25,250
kinda food gaming stuff so have a little
bit a time left: ID question so far

744
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,570
boa I get I am

745
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:32,960
what's our next thing yes we talk about
we can talk about the

746
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,660
we know we can talk about them suffer a
little bit so the software ok all

747
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,720
delicious corpse

748
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,690
and it's pretty delicious it's basically
it's a it's kinda it's kinda like

749
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,410
exquisite corpse but it's with food

750
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,410
you can have specify I am

751
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:50,700
all the ingredients that you want to put
its every time you reload which is court

752
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,170
says

753
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:55,830
frogs legs perfumed with sabe no key

manual de gastric

755
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:00,500
right just kinda makes up weird things
troubled for sure pesto

756
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,850
sounds pretty good care myspace address
and you can say I'm vegan

757
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:08,200
right and you can shamir and a menu and
okay if you get rid of meat dairy and

758
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:08,870
seafood

759
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:13,069
and so kinda boring but I am your
Persian artichoke waffle

760
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:16,110
does not sound good key once a lot as
grouper no phone

761
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,390
and you can also going shopping with you
can add things like a man

762
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:24,009
woman dog cat God

763
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:27,130
cheeses her right

764
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,170
and then and then it kind of this match
against the cans makes you

765
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,170
a menu on these people and I'm
deep-fried cheese is Goa

766
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,330
first a your

767
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,720
grilled captaincy man encrusted Jesus
souffle

768
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,010
cheeses baked cats will that's really go
out

769
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,670
and so of course we put we put Ubuntu
diseases in a

770
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:52,850
because that's really funny there are
like diseases scurvy vinegar charts good

771
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,230
as you

772
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:59,300
the Hyatt ironing skirt even occur you
have because studies in like a vitamin C

773
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,050
over anyway

774
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,120
a that shapes if was set a firm in
today's loaf

775
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,080
called rickets I we had you know but %um
things like a

776
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,990

778
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,940
Cisco change Iran things about other
religions of course which are

779
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,960
which everyone loves a the confession
cockroach

780
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,210
for July sandwich individually wrapped
Ross too far in love

781
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:31,080
that's pretty good episcopalian smoked
pot farm Calvinist in Crossett Methodist

782
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
in Roman Catholic polluter

783
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:36,840
Lutheran cheesecake led a deadlock when
our

784
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,010
some Methodist going back and we also
have a

785
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:43,220
caste census guy neighborhoods is really
cute too if anyone anyway sense is

786
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,050
considered the world people live there
so

787
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,530
so this is kind of weird little game and
so we can work under the Versa this bike

788
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:53,260
because look at polish North Beach row
see-saw anyway so kinda looking at

789
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,370
its kinda Google bomb in a lot of ways
to so you can kind of look at your

790
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,490
favorite one or whatever so if you look
at

791
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:01,820
we do a little research on the logs and
he said well as three main groups of

792
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,070
people that are getting here from Google
traffic right

793
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,870
there's like a people who are typing in
lists of ingredients

794
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:11,850
like chicken liver salmon fillet duck
breast clams

795
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:15,839
give me a recipe right or Italian lamb
shank meant the kind of

796
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,980
typing at things that they've either
have the kitchen or they want

797
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:22,170
in a dish looking for a recipe the
second-biggest list

798
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,360
is a tight names products people are
typing in Iraq and cheese for 200

799
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,310
avocado

800
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,560
or raw marcona almonds or Hmoob cookout

801
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,960
this is kinda weird up kasinga Smith um

802
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,930
so and then the largest group of people
were typing in weird shit

803
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,310
right broccoli cheese cake I

804
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:44,490
mushroom figure well three got the
charter regular

805
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,000
outside so biscuits ravioli monk fish
pie

806
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,330
algae are deep-fried time that maybe
it's not so we're potato kennelly

807
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:55,480
three have a budget strawberrys ameche
watermelon caviar

808
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,210
tuna cheese cake I am Vegemite curry

809
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:03,190
10 NASCAR right actually speak about
about seven so

810
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:07,260
so this this so this recipe the so I
really like this as far as I thinking

811
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,400
about the DNA thing out there looking at
you have

812
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,910
copywriting the the genome right you
kinda like saying

813
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:15,890
oh that's weird thing you to start over
mister some jelly already thought of it

814
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,170
right and so the next step for the
software is how to actually

815
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:21,750
create that recipe was the Semantic Web
engine so before

816
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,240
we get so that is what take all it took
of people who aren't saying we're

817
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,240
a do about the you might think and your
head Vegemite

818
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:33,060
a mentor to visualize this thing that
you know get made Australians not starve

819
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,049
during world war 2

820
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:37,960
so love for that as occurs but a
Vegemite we had hearings began actlabs

821
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,910
we actually a poached say time satan's
I'm not saying those

822
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,040
Satan Helsing it's you know it's it
sweet wheat protein

823
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,759
where she posted in a Vegemite stock so
I made this Vegemite stock

824
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,340
and so that this kind of protein what

825
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,970
was IMing

826
00:42:55,970 --> 00:43:00,940
right yo you look at me we're getting I
don't know do that as well check it out

827
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:04,570
so anyway the it's a satanic have smells
like a taste like unofficially is

828
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:08,160
okay so I'm time saying that better it
actually tasted pretty nice as far as

829
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,529
making a Vegemite stock and then

830
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,750
show is kinda putting a flavor into
Satan Brea see kinda like making orange

831
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,240
juice and and I'm

832
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,410
lemon grass stock in approach the
satanic at a slight batter

833
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,220
Europe which I and two minutes in a
minute can taste like Indian lamb

834
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,750
I am alright so now we'll talk a little
bit about the new version delicious

835
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:26,440
corpse which is this

836
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,870
kinda have the Semantic Web back and
which came from this

837
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:32,750
these out the current version which is
court some thinking we actually want to

838
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,950
create recipes for each

839
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:37,400
these things right I wanna I wanna be
able to say all those recipes are out

840
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,270
there if you think a bit

841
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,470
well you're speeding it's our interface
so we can actually disassembling create

842
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,340
it started

843
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,740
making have a visual interfaces like how
to had a mouseover

844
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,700
your different kinds they just kept
thinking about visualization rove

845
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,450
recipes and how it's really a pain in
the ass to read recipes on the internet

846
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,680
Skype 100000 recipes on the internet

847
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,759
and they all kinda have are a pain in
the ass to read so there's this thing

848
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,170
called delicious courts

849
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,480
I am it's a %uh its official recipe
builder

850
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,740
me get rid of this one really quick it's
a visual others the toe again

851
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,930
yes sure you Tito geez right now

852
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:13,990
not so much I'll see saver is

853
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:17,600
okay so let's talk a little bit about
the delicious courts okay

854
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,950
so we start by making a semantic engines
we started

855
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:24,390
thinking about things a.m. as different
effects I try general effects in the

856
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,170
mouth can have a scripting language

857
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:30,020
trying to find every food so you know I
can think of textures and different

858
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,210
regions and cuisines and you know that
Filipino food is all stinky and smelly

859
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:37,790
right texting key and sour kind of and
the different phases of matter

860
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:40,730
result I'm a scripting language right
here for knowing that you know all

861
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:41,680
solids

862
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,770
you can catch up them right but you
can't shop water

863
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:48,100
as it's not a solid in the chief reason
to change the face start building the

864
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,710
Semantic Web edge in a while back

865
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,870
lets you able to say things like
chocolate a solids liquids fat

866
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:56,440
it's sweet it's better and Mexicans a
you know spice it

867
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,700
you know and then have a lot of
preparations as well you're kinda for us

868
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,920
this is like a more scripting languages
for that

869
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,510
and we actually have here's here's what
other the recipe pages for it

870
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:10,180
this is kinda visual interface for
French onion soup right its you look at

871
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,480
the pictures the ingredients

872
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,120
and you have all these kind of your prep
I can surround if you click on France up

873
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,279
in a corner you can change some rockin
onion soup

874
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,040
and little change in lab like onions are
orange zest and cinnamon

875
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,380
right James onion too but are not know
make a French butternut soup issues in

876
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:25,400
the same ingredients

877
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,800
because you can change it to souffle
annexes souffle without the same

878
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,540
ingredients

879
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,690
so there's a bad said you can put onto
recipes are on the Internet

880
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:35,700
to drag it into this vision the witches
course official recipe builder

881
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,130
and then you see if I can grab one of
these guys really quick so is this

882
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,970
sliders on the side that allow you to

883
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,170
this is a bad example San

884
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,350
ago there's another French onion soup i
think is every time you change something

885
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,200
automatically

886
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,300
updates the instructions down there
right as that of course you have all

887
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:56,120
these different kinda sliders on the
side that allow you to say

888
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,200
you know the skills easy doesn't take a

967
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:53,200
as I really care about like before the
parade is as was another point about us

968
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,230
getting exploited which is people try
like

969
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,980
we've had like a.m. you know David
Letterman interview

970
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,530
ABC BBC trying in touch with exploit our
shit and be like

971
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,460

reality show tits like great so what

972
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,300

think that when you say what's the

977
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,610
greatest thing

978
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:22,740
I think the great thing we've done is
created connections to everybody I mean

979
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,930
I can really see all my friends this
world be like

awesome shit so that's more important to

981
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,100
me than

982
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,410
special flavor

983
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:37,049
right formats

984
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:42,360
