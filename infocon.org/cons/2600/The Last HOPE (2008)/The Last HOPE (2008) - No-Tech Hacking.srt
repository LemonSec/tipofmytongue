put their hands up

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,208

some fun stuff

20
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:46,500
those people that put their hands up can

21
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,619
just make the talks sock so

22
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,099
if you're if you're near them and they
start to make the talks Oct

23
00:01:53,099 --> 00:02:00,099
Justin asked them to stop

24
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,010
rights only to my intro you don't look
at me when I do the entry work there

25
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,360
this is me as most of you know I do this

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,770
devoted wanna these which some people
think is this

27
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,480
and some people think is this every
think it is I'm definitely not want to

28
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,060
use unless it's this kind

29
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,290
mall so professional wanna be's

30
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,049
although I'm not dead yet more like 10
these about the bad haircut

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm I must be one of these because every
time

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I load a page like this in my browser it
auto fills this

33
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,030
I'm also want to use for these nice
folks as evidenced by all of this

34
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,260
am proud to say that I don't have to
take sides in this debate because

35
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,880
I'm both I know you're skeptical but I'm
actually practicing what are these

36
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,410
because I'm student at this

37
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,450
which translates into this which most
the Vino is this

38
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,940
I currently have this in very close to
getting this but

39
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:04,019
I'm also one of these like this but not
the Lego kind more like this the cool

40
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:04,630
kind

41
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,070
but in all honesty I'm a blood relative
love this guy

42
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:14,530
who most love you know better from this
picture

43
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,299
so even though I'm this and this and
this

44
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,120
and this and this I'm pretty passionate
about my role as this

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,790
I'm the founder this which some love you
like better by this name

46
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,560
so we do is we put hackers to work on
charitable projects in exchange for

47
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
references from

48
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,510
industry leaders so these can get these
by designing things like this

49
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,459
we also build classrooms like this using
donated equipment like this and this

50
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:46,989
so the children underdeveloped countries
can attend computer classes like this

51
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,670
the ideas that they'll become self
sufficient which is really the only way

52
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,079
to break the cycle of poverty

53
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,260
so if you wanna do this for these or if
you're tired of doing this

54
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:01,849
and you'd like to land that real job
come to us to get some love this

55
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,489
by working with us so stop by our
website send us lots of money

56
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:11,120
white t-shirt or by the no tech hacking
book all proceeds go to feed African

57
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,739
children

58
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:18,739
at stake

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,889
okay but most have York here for that
you're here for the talk

60
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:28,330
%uh this this is not a talk about high
technology which is

61
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,560
stuff like this which is your wireless
and viruses and trojans

62
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,850
and password cracking a lock picking a
packet sniffing

63
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,560
and all that stuff this is not about no
tech is not about high-tech this is

64
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,690
about no tech

65
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,050
which is the subject love this book
before a

66
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,880
before I give you an idea of what this
is let me just tell you where this idea

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,690
came from

68
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,590
II works with this guy named vince who
was in the physical security and the guy

69
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,260
was

70
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,659
an absolute legend in the first gig that
I went on with this guy

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,660
we had to break into this really secure
facility that had this

72
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,840
immense door that you know when he
skipped lookin dorsey

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,449
you drive a truck in to the door the
truck bounces that Contador

74
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:14,800
we had to break into this facility and
so we're

75
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,099
word outside sir a milling around and
Vince is watching people going out

76
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,740
and I'm thinkin you know based on this
guy's reputation I see the little procs

77
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,639
reader over there

78
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:28,780
I'm thinking he's gonna break out like
the alligator clips I

79
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,800
his its gonna do something with like it
an LCD screen there's gonna be like you

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,919
know dahmer flipping you know like in
the movies

81
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,190
there's gonna be like that mission
impossible thing or get really close the

82
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,199
Florence went on it and everything goes
to hell in a handbasket

83
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,130
guy that's what I'm thinking but after a
few minutes Vince goes

84
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,830
I gotta go like ok

85
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,479
okay so your I don't really know this
guy some thinking it's like

86
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,270
some stomach virus or something an honor
that

87
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,409
said to Mike okay its let's go

88
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:02,810
we drive back to the hotel parks out
front he comes out

89
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,389
and after a few minutes he's he's got
this up he's got a wire

90
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:13,080
coat hanger and a wet washcloth I'm
still thinking stomach disorder

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,448
we drive back to the building

92
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:22,130
like 630 it's after working hours
nobody's really around

93
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,300
obviously government facility in he
walks up to the door while he's walking

94
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,590
up to the door he's feeling that this
coat hanger remakes into a long piece of

95
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,490
wire reports the coat hanger on the
anvil to the whole thing in half

96
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,919
what's up to the door jambs the coat
hanger through the crack in the center

97
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:37,690
the door

98
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,029
slides it down and starts flapping
around here on the other side the door

99
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:41,779
flap flap flap

100
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,190
click I hear the door unlocked he goes
in

101
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:53,190
what site through leaves me on the
sidewalk picking up security camp

102
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,510
what he had done was defeat this
multi-million-dollar security system

103
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,979
with

104
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,979
like trash be

105
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,090
trash and treasure thing right he took
this to a whole new level

106
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,219
and 1i finally

107
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,229
get up the nerve to just go into the
building with them

108
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,510
I was like dude what was that about and
he's like did you look at the door I

109
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:15,979
said

110
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:19,070
yet either you know there was a push bar
on the back to things like no was not

111
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,520
push bar was a touch Bar

112
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,960
that doesn't know the difference between
a wet washcloth

113
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,889
and a human hand so I learned a lesson
about touch bars but the really

114
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,550
important lesson that I learned

115
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,740
was how to not complicate things now

116
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,110
you've been through this through this
conference and probably several others

117
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:37,550
in for

118
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,090
all sorts of high-tech solutions for
breaking stuff and I think those are

119
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,779
incredibly cool don't get me wrong

120
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:46,550
my point is I think there's a lotta room
for simple situations

121
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,190
you know solving problems and simple
ways and that's what this is about

122
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,500
up but because this is a hacker
conference and it's not your

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,310
you know corporate suit & Tie conference
me give you the lowdown on what this

124
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,870
really is because we're gonna drop
skills in that teach you how to do some

125
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:06,289
unbelievable things sure you to the
spirit of a conference like hope

126
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:09,870
you teach you these things the real jet
I waving gonna show you how

127
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,760
x-ray vision works I'm gonna show you
how to blend in with the feds how to

128
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,909
pass through walls in

129
00:08:13,909 --> 00:08:17,610
Papa smoke get into locked cabinets
without using your hands

130
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,380
hacked hack workstations with one
keystroke

131
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,789
suck data of machines with your mind
sniff

132
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,810
email network traffic without a computer
and defeat physical security with trash

133
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,539
and stuff

134
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:36,539
how's that sound I like this cuz it's
like an issue 26 undertake this is

135
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,790
this is great alright so skill number
one x-ray vision seeing

136
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,430
through people now I know that the guys
in the audience are thinking something

137
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,910
else

138
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,459
this is this you can use this skill for
that this is really a specific

139
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,690
sure thing and as you'll see as we go
through here up I like messing with word

140
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,260
so there's lots of parties here so

141
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,630
it's not really seeing through people it
seeing through the facade to get through

142
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,720
to a person really is for example this
guy

143
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,110
what can you tell me about this guy

144
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,579
you sitting excellent you've got a
future in this

145
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:20,800
he's at the airport very good very good
he's got a hat this is great

146
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,420
were warming up I heard ex-military why

147
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:32,110
the footwear the haircut the boots
anybody know the brand name for those

148
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,790
it high-tech the irony as thick as an

149
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,670
high-tech boots very nice he's also got
the sleeves rolled up which says an

150
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,130
awful lot about him

151
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,170
he's he's watching stewardesses or by
that says something else

152
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,339
also he's probably straight the Oakleys

153
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,400
now there's a nickname for this style
love Oakley I for dinner for two as

154
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,140
shooters

155
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,220
up because people that wear them shoot

156
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,520
there's also the thing it's written on
the back up a sack anybody read that

157
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,089
says but that is not bananas that's
different to its been Nelly

158
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:14,350
USA dot com anybody know panelli is

159
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,360
yes now they don't just make shotguns
for

160
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,780
like shooting ducks right the shoot
shotguns that like block tanks and

161
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,490
stuffing

162
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,280
like I guess I was in the military
obviously constructors don't want tanks

163
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,069
but

164
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:30,849
up they sell special purpose guns

165
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,110
so he's in the airport Benelli USA hat

166
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,280
now you can get an idea this guy's
profile

167
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:40,740
but there's one piece a information
missing this guy

168
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,920
free boarded my flight by himself

169
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,390
right sky marshal the irony is he's not
just the sky marshal he's an undercover

170
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,230
sky marshal

171
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,819
RNC see how this works seeing through
people taking a look at somebody

172
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:02,819
observing figuring stuff out what you
tell me about this guy

173
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,660
I'll go with the married one instead
that that's good married again

174
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:16,170
he's literate right the magazine is not
upside down that's

175
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,650
skin vitamin D deficiency

176
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:26,650
Scott that anything else no not p.m.
yellow tag is is %uh

177
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:34,400
his baggage that has baggage ything
that's good because that's a that's a

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,700
transfer tag it means he's come from
somewhere

179
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,200
he's also got vitamin D deficiency I'm
not sure if you picked out of

180
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,660
there's other stuff that you can look at
figure out some stuff about this guy

181
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,560
what would you use yeah somebody's
picking up the seal

182
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,620
on the back seat on the floor there
here's the seal US Nuclear Regulatory

183
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,920
Commission

184
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,430
no I know for a fact that he didn't get
this at their conference cuz their

185
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,320
conference socks

186
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,180
so he probably works for the US Nuclear
Regulatory Commission

187
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,850
and I we get more information about him
I look at things like a sky mile tax all

188
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,399
the stuff

189
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,470
so my question to you is do you think
that the information about where the US

190
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,640
Nuclear Regulatory Commission is headed

191
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,680
and when is valuable I would

192
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,040
I would guess that it probably is so
here's a guy from

193
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,250
said agency right traveling around

194
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,779
he's probably security-conscious right
the bag

195
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:34,610
well lives in Atlanta that was hard core

196
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:40,089
you actually know the dude fed

197
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:45,040
skin

198
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,610
well I will enjoy your attention to the
blurred areas in this photo seem on the

199
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,240
sides

200
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,350
that's thats my arm and

201
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,260
my side because I'm taking a picture
with my back to him like bring a camera

202
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,160
in my armpit

203
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,370
shooting like this it's a advance ninja
move its

204
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:07,370
very don't this playground

205
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,800
know that was the computer nerd move
that's different a.m.

206
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,700
yet what that the funny thing is I think
after a while this guy caught on to what

207
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,410
I was doing

208
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,339
funny thing is he didn't do anything
about it

209
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,630
that's also sir the sad part I'm in an
airport creepy looking guy taking

210
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,500
pictures of him in his stuff

211
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,330
I mean he's sitting next to an
undercover Air Marshal for god sakes ago

212
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,050
told him

213
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,380
but he didn't okay one more worky talk
about this guy yeah

214
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,480
he works out good Nokia

215
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
hats are no actually you're seeing half
a bit this is from Dark Knight

216
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,350
this is to face the other sites other
sites good but %um military

217
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,430
married good the Iron Man

218
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,440
okay let's let's dig a little bit deeper
what else can you tell us about and what

219
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,920
operating system is using

220
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,230
good let's confirm the military thing

221
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,690
up US military casualty statistics

222
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,890
he reports to a lieutenant colonel as
the

223
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:14,220
subjective his email so looking at
people is one thing

224
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,500
okay but I've also employed another
skill here this is a skill number to

225
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,470
sucking data

226
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:23,220
of machines with your mind you tell
people you can do this you gotta keep

227
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,460
this close help break you like a
magician has a tricky tells people how

228
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,060
it's done and it sucks

229
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,500
you gonna do not tell people how it's
done just tell them that you have the

230
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,700
skill and they'll be like

231
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,400
who right but it used to be called
something else used to be called

232
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,680
shoulder surfing

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,810
now it's sucking data of machines up
their mind that there's a definite

234
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,910
artis shoulder surfing you have to be
pretty bold to do it I'm not very bold I

235
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,449
mean title back kinda guys just gonna
wander around

236
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,340
hovering over people's shoulders taking
pictures their laptops regardless of

237
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,040
where they are

238
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,910
did it so I'm so good at it yeah yeah

239
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,790
so I yeah I'd I do this at the funny
thing is I before we get to the

240
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,000
the actual meet love this which is
what's on the screen

241
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,040
it's not the keyboard that's how it
started looking for passwords it's the

242
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,689
screen

243
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,490
before we get to the screen oh there's
other things you can look at on the

244
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,030
laptops I love this

245
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,110
the business card I got like always
personal information about him you know

246
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,470
where he lives or works

247
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,830
phone number email address all that
stuff fortunately this is an uncommon

248
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,730
occurrence

249
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,960
people to put business cards stickers on
their laptops

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,960
yet is a common occurrence but at least
they're small

251
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,779
caution ultra-sensitive handle with care
and it's written in Chinese and bright

252
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:40,490
orange

253
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,490
think it's a target ESA miss this

254
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:46,800
by right so yeah

255
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,269
shoulder surfing you get really close to
somebody sometimes you responding

256
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:52,240
intimate was no big deal he didn't mind

257
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,399
didn't seem to anyway up but I can tell
things about him like he's the VP of

258
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,220
acquisitions and I should steal his
laptop cuz acquisition date is

259
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,399
just excellent but there's other things
you can look at as well

260
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,029
for example the taskbar a stink dog or a
really good paper about this he called

261
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:10,369
an electronic deduction

262
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:14,639
I really like this idea the ideas you
can tell an awful lot about a person by

263
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,249
looking at their screens

264
00:16:16,249 --> 00:16:20,220
specifically things like their task bar
for example what can you tell me about

265
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,929
some of these

266
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:25,589
icons on the screen about the two yellow
balls they're chilean

267
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,139
what's its status good

268
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:32,980
%uh to over what's the little yellow man
yes

269
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,089
what's that status connected

270
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:40,279
all right let's pause trillion

271
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,360
which includes aim support and

272
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,660
a.m. both running and both connected
tell me about the technical ability %uh

273
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,939
this person on a scale one to 10 with 1
being the lowest

274
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:55,349
how would you rank this person 0

275
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:59,379
but -3 1337

276
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:04,339
good answer nice okay now what about a
profile

277
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,198
the Spurs yet somebody didn't notice the
up anti-virus the Red Shield of the acts

278
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,130
that means machine can't be hacked so

279
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:18,130
I was get them backwards and it screws
me up all the time i attacked the wrong

280
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,850
shield colored machines in at all just
goes though alright

281
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:24,859
now we know what this person's

282
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,140
doing for what are they running like to
aim clients at the same time

283
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:36,620
mean we think maybe they do for a living
not touching that one

284
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,640
up the talk to people

285
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,200
up maybe I don't know management %uh
pedophile mean there's lotsa

286
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,300
of the possibilities but the technical
level is low we all agree right

287
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,550
now let me expand the taskbar and I
wanna show you one icon

288
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,450
and based on the 1i can i watch to
reconsider who this person is and what

289
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:57,860
they do

290
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,160
on tore

291
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,590
that's the Vidalia Onion so they're
inflicting all of their web traffic

292
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:08,949
its on it's enabled are decryption

293
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,940
right they're using job of points that's
my word for proxy

294
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:17,530
XO big people sipping a traffic and see
what they're doing or where they're

295
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,660
going what's the technical level now

296
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,180
they have a smart son that's good I i
mean

297
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,060
it's not like a 10 right but they're
smarter you know that their there a

298
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:29,710
little bit

299
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,600
farther above the curve they're up to
something the point is that's one little

300
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,330
iconic

301
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:38,500
so looking at one little icon like that
you can completely profile somebody

302
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,240
and that was staying dogs idea with with
this thing is a it doesn't take much

303
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,600
now if you get a little more real estate
like god forbid you get their browser

304
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,370
you get a look at their browser and you
see all this crap you can tell you can

305
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,610
more or if you get the whole screen

306
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,400
like this one the songs captured in the
field let's pull it apart

307
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,730
what's the OS might

308
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,770
tats too easy alright what a office of
where they have installed

309
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,160
Microsoft a reason right

310
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,060
this is a this is a harder one I'll what
type of business are they any

311
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:16,419
sales very good

312
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,290
what one piece of hardware they probably
have on them besides their laptop

313
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,860
specifically help all very nice

314
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:29,330
not so this is already a target right
because they probably have their palm

315
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,429
backed up on this laptop soon if you
just the

316
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,660
a comment the this is a target what
business offer these back at the office

317
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,870
very good how they connect to it secure
remote

318
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:47,870
anybody know it secure remote is that's
right this is checkpoint VPN software

319
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,940
you know what that is search for work by

320
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:58,740
profile this person for me shiny

321
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,210
Chinese good it's good

322
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:07,220
technical level pretty high yeah I mean
this guy has how many council windows

323
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,460
open

324
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,910
me like three for him a gooey is just
like some excuse

325
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,880
for not having to hit Alt f1 all deaf to
all tough for me.

326
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,310
alright so he's got a high technical
level is looking at some sort of

327
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,810
you know high-tech code or something are
about this guy

328
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:28,010
we think he does for a living good

329
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:35,010
a professional paintball is an option
might go Army Navy surplus worker that's

330
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,350
good to know

331
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,070
and are let's just assume that he's in
the military it's safe

332
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:43,919
well we'll go with that now I know for a
fact that I have no chance of sneaking

333
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,260
up on this particular guy cuz he's read
the code

334
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,340
he's read the road warrior code

335
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,429
which states that road warriors are wary
an alert travelers

336
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:57,360
wary and alert travelers

337
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,920
you they also prevent against public
display of content AKA shoulder surfing

338
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,750
Road worriers so the odds of me getting
close enough to lick this guy's neck to

339
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,450
take a picture

340
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:14,720
Spain pretty slim

341
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,120
right okay tell as dermatological
condition we can also see these log into

342
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,780
a be a WebLogic Server as admin

343
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,160
bad member of the military

344
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,740
here's another one this is a killer
shoulder surfing I mean %uh sucking

345
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,170
data of love machines with your mind
exercise it's hard to see but this is me

346
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,250
shooting across the aisle on a plane

347
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,480
the guy next to me is not with me we're
not traveling together so I had a

348
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,490
you know put up my coat to serve as a
barrier so he wouldn't get suspicious

349
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:50,330
when the flash one of anyway he puts
laptop away and this guy ever hears

350
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,810
one out some paperwork eventually he
pulls out this know it's hard to read

351
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,990
but it's the government systems use
again

352
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,830
2006 strategic plan not knowing exactly
when

353
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,419
use again it was I had to look it up its
electronic warfare signal intelligence

354
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:11,370
2006 strategic plan up to date on the
photo is 2000 5

355
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,560
but I'm here to say that

356
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,179
up I'm not all about doom and gloom I
mean that the days I love sucking data

357
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,060
of machines with your mind is

358
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,379
is long gone our shoulder surfing call
it whatever you want

359
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,320
it is dead it will never work again
after this talk

360
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,129
it won't because there's one product on
the market that kills it dead

361
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:42,130
nope

362
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,130
little itchy

363
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,419
little hot but it works

364
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,279
up

365
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:03,019
it is definitely Japanese they think
everything first

366
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,080
and most things a bingo first are good
yeah

367
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,899
now this week this one was a an
interesting session that I got I was so

368
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,820
excited actually shoulder surface

369
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:18,428
computer that I almost missed it was
sitting on her

370
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:24,899
so the point is sucking isn't just for
shoulder surfers anymore

371
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,929
sucking date of machines this is the
section that I call

372
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,089
kiosk Akane for example here's a kiosk
in the airport this is the Delta kiosk

373
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,039
what's the OS

374
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,559
good yeah I see how easy this is like if
I told the hacker

375
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,269
okay that Delta kiosk over there I want
the operating system I wanna know

376
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:45,249
you know the IP address I wanna
networking technologies that it's using

377
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,029
Bob Loblaw

378
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:49,269
the hacker would be like oh okay I go
figure out if its wireless ago figure

379
00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:51,519
out what access points on bob I gotta do
some like

380
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,200
window sizes the figure out or you just
look

381
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,499
thats no te cracking for example here's
a check in terminal

382
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:03,580
about this one this one is that the the
thing that takes your tickets

383
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,070
at the airport has some nice air screens
on it

384
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,450
here's one at the grocery store what's
the OS

385
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,259
good

386
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:17,700
yeah it's that's really good well

387
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,799
nice the grocery store at

388
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,259
okay yeah company way like yours that
these are out of order I'm sorry but

389
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:29,399
if I wanted to tell hacker to get all
that information about this machine at

390
00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:31,469
the very difficult must they moved
closer

391
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,529
it is the IP is the operating system
they're running okay

392
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:38,710
about this kiosk this is a nice kiosk
public phone

393
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,719
figure out the OS and every bad file
record segment

394
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:45,019
on it easy as well

395
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:48,509
like about kiosks here's the next skill

396
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:52,409
packing hard work stations with one
keystroke what's the key stroke

397
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:56,049
haven't heard it yet

398
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:59,309
one key enter enter

399
00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:02,399
okay well here's a kiosk this is just
the employment you know those

400
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:06,739
employment things at the store the %uh
the key is actually shift

401
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,779
yield Sticky Keys thing his shift five
times are keep it down

402
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:15,669
like all the kiosks forget about this
one they lock the thing down from like

403
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:20,789
everything accept that works all over
the place gets you access to this menu

404
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:21,739
pops up the

405
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:25,979
star but much against are playing around
here's a link for burns a

406
00:25:25,979 --> 00:25:30,879
a on known bop

407
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:35,849
place group yet but anyway had the key

408
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:40,689
comes up there's the menu one keystroke
well

409
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,229
I think you can hold it for me I well

410
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:47,269
tell the joke great when you do it come
off better

411
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:50,429
now let me talk about

412
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:54,489
be granddaddy one of the grand daddy's
evolve kiosks

413
00:25:54,489 --> 00:25:58,559
you guys have like you got the red light
cameras around here you go through a red

414
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:58,979
light

415
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:02,279
it takes your picture viewer your
license plate males you a ticket

416
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:07,629
how much does that suck now as hackers
we have to heat something like that

417
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:10,869
we have to because its technology

418
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,579
that makes us pay money good

419
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:20,999
to do something that should be free it's
dangerous granted but

420
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:24,559
it should be free so as hackers we have
to hate this

421
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,570
so every opportunity I have to figure
out what happens behind the scenes are

422
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,689
those like systems

423
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,159
I'm all over it so imagine the look on
my face when I drove by

424
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,210
this intersection at a red light camera
and I see this

425
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,059
two guys inside the box working on the
system itself

426
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,759
so I immediately pull off the road

427
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,809
ran over a curb drove my car into a bush

428
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:53,599
forward shoulder roll came up with the
camera got the picture

429
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,370
car explodes

430
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:00,290
I planned it all out the guys distracted
he walks away like not an accident you

431
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,129
know it's not about

432
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:04,970
I just walked up to him I

433
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,460
and I thought you know this you the
pictures from the bush thing is just

434
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,470
tired so I just walked up to him in like

435
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,700
is at a computer in their good

436
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:18,620
and the

437
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,140
the two guys turn around they just look
at me

438
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,970
I didn't get that you computer guys
never supposed

439
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:31,149
represent so I switched tactics he was
obviously

440
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,649
are not buying the whole thing I set up
yeah I know that sounds really weird but

441
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:40,820
I'm a computer guy to an dude I think
you got the call this job in the world

442
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,730
looks at his friend looks at me

443
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,960
big smile on his face he's like yeah
this is pretty cool

444
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,539
he's like a is like you know this is %ah
yes is a

445
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:57,950
a wireless system in and I we don't
really have to open the boxes cuz we can

446
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:00,700
use wireless keyboards and mice actually
control it for me

447
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:07,029
like sy said

448
00:28:07,029 --> 00:28:10,909
really that's probably like really
specialized like high tech keys like you

449
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,529
know it's just like Microsoft you know
Wireless you get it like

450
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:16,710
and then he he sorted out this look

451
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,000
like you just said up the wrong thing
I'm like I don't do your

452
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,240
your little bit over my head was like

453
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,299
um I think this is cool bigger you know
a lot smarter need my fight is take a

454
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:29,519
picture so that I can make sure my
friend is like

455
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,639
should work but took the picture

456
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:38,850
amber little exercise from our
electronic deduction how much you can

457
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,090
get from these things

458
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,200
well there's two icons that just made me
like instantly fall over when I took the

459
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,889
picture

460
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:49,490
his Internet Explorer

461
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,960
and semantic PC anywhere and I said

462
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,330
semantic PC anywhere I've heard that
that's like

463
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:01,129
you know remote control software he's
like yeah but you know we're

464
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:06,700
world wanna closed wireless network us

465
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,960
we mean closed he's like well we used 10
addresses so

466
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,580
you know you can't really doesn't get to
the internet so I can't be and they got

467
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,500
that look again

468
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,910
yeah I left I left after

469
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,010
which alright so here's this is this is
a great when I i love thee the other

470
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:28,170
granddaddy of kiosks I guess the
operating system with us

471
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:35,170
kiosk and ATM machine that needs to be
activated in seven days

472
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:46,310
get your money out quick people I'm
wondering if like proceeds like ATM fees

473
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,690
actually go to pay for the license to

474
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:52,580
make it legitimate or not okay so

475
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:55,620
here is here is skilled number three

476
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,770
case kill number three is networking
email sniffing without a computer for

477
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,010
less than three dollars

478
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:03,290
okay here's how it works: I'm gonna do
it from here

479
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:06,670
came by tell me where I'm gonna start up

480
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:10,890
TV very nice it's not just any TV it's a
TV with one of these in the drawer

481
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,650
me it's protected though

482
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,680
with a high-tech physical security
system

483
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,240
hold a piece of plastic in the biz we
call this a collar

484
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,790
its very high tech because you have a
special tool to open it

485
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:31,909
or like my friend sir Bolex the you can
just jam a whole bunch a toilet paper

486
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,050
down in there to lock up a little Co X

487
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:37,060
not in there jamala well people in there
and then

488
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,510
just turn the collar and because it's so
jammed up in their the correct thing

489
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,780
turns you pull it right off

490
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:46,250
at step one it's a little technical i
know im stretching just a little bit

491
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:46,610
here

492
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:50,810
right step two is to buy this device I
gotta for $2.99 at a thrift store this

493
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,470
issue

494
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,760
like 1994 back on hope started table

495
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,110
cable tuner right you got to the cable
box and TV out then you can adjust

496
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,810
the TV stations because that's the
second layer of security on the system

497
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,980
is they lock the TVs down see you can't
get that just any station

498
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,050
so this bypasses that let you go to
whatever station you want but the TV on

499
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,760
three use your cable box

500
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,750
you start to see things like this talk
about sniffing network traffic

501
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,170
people I'll blogging you know doing
they're out there

502
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,820
their bills on for their room here's an
administrative console on the hotel

503
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,860
network because

504
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,250
G it's just more expensive to put

505
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:33,610
the hotel's administrative network for
all the billing

506
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:36,780
and the pay per view network on you know
separate drops

507
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:40,340
you pay for that network one siebert
altogether

508
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,450
right that's what lets people look at

509
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:49,080
hotel checkin from their room okay well
this this particular

510
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,439
admin console lid up really early in the
morning

511
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:59,150
%ah an started browsing porn

512
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,310
not only was he browsing porn but I got
a popup that says you've had too much

513
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:07,700
you never really heard have a buddy get
cut off

514
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:14,080
this is some new thing but I can watch
guests login to eBay Inc you know

515
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,679
loggins their American Express count
going to their internet banking account

516
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:21,360
you know all this stuff lenses network
snipping without a computer for less

517
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,200
than three dollars this is the skill

518
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,310
now this was an interesting story I was
at a I was a

519
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:30,800
DOD conference an I did the sort of
thing I see is

520
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:35,660
this person go back to their room after
the conference in to get onto the Yahoo

521
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,000
Air Force message group and start
reading message you know

522
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,420
Mike I gotta like a person that goes to
a conference

523
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:45,930
goes back to the room after the
conference and keeps working I mean

524
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:46,300
that's

525
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,990
like dedication I mean I I like this guy
already was like this is

526
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,310
disguise call yes he's looking through
all these messages are any

527
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:57,340
sent an email off to his wife he's like
long day really tired going to bed

528
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,430

531
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,850
brothels in Las Vegas and

532
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,640
finds his way to the Shady Lady ranch
prints out

533
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,540
directions our technically I don't think
he was lying

534
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,100
make think you did go to bed

535
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,870
right skill number for seeing past
vehicles

536
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,450
this is the ex revision number two were
using

537
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,530
were using words and twisting them and
making them puns this is

538
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,889
was be fine it's not seeing through
vehicles its seeing through the week

539
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,880
exterior that rights to hide what they
really are

540
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,740
but this is for example what's this yeah
it could be a fat it's it's actually an

541
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,680
undercover police car because they're a
Police Interceptor on the back over

542
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,030
undercover police cars

543
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:54,320
so that they can stay under covers don't
get that

544
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,659
actor what about this one government

545
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,920
this is the van with the candy yes it is

546
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:07,050
hang US government vehicle okay what is
the driver of this vehicle do for a

547
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:12,759
living

548
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,510
he doesn't get out much the bottom

549
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,659
about social status is this person

550
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,560
yes they're they're cute but the
question is are they a

551
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,969
real geek you have to judge from the
reading material it's Stephen King's the

552
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:26,550
cell

553
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:29,800
if they throw it out the window while
it's

554
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,179
flaming them they're probably a true
geek their eyes are just that all three

555
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,918
another Stephen King book which

556
00:34:36,918 --> 00:34:40,069
site sucked right

557
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:46,190
driver of this vehicle I give you a clue

558
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,839
now I really don't know a whole lot
about navy chiefs

559
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,109
I was in the military but I watched
movies

560
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:58,308
and I know a little bit about navy
chiefs out that this particular navy

561
00:34:58,309 --> 00:34:59,710
chief was in custody

562
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,890
as in he's in handcuffs ease he's
literally chained to his see

563
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,720
in like an airport and he's got to
escorts right

564
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,819
so he smashes the face up one ask or

565
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:18,710
with his own face %uh and does this too
is other escort again with no hands

566
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:24,279
he's beating people up with his face he
seems okay with that

567
00:35:24,279 --> 00:35:27,390
right but this is not just

568
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:33,650
any ordinary navy chief what else can
you tell looking at the stickers

569
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,640
enter a American

570
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,589
grateful this you know rifle that guns
this guns that

571
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:48,390
this is actually a gun lobbying navy
chief I'm standing in the parking lot

572
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,930
taking photos a gun loving navy chiefs
right

573
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,319
so I'm thinking about that unlike

574
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,420
has probably not the smartest thing I've
ever done

575
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,740
so just getting ready to leave and and I
see somebody

576
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,380
tried it Jack navy chief scar and I'm
watching this number I'll I can't

577
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,380
believe this

578
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:11,500
in the person gets in the car

579
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,490
starts it up and drives away not like in
a rush psych real casual knitted

580
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,109
dawned on me this is the navy chief

581
00:36:20,109 --> 00:36:27,109
have a look them

582
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,780
rights to the skill doesn't always work

583
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:37,470
but if that was really her I should have
been a lot more free then I was cuz it's

584
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:37,990
subtle

585
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,410
are looking tell me about the owner of
this vehicle if there are if

586
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:45,990
if their part where they work for
example could you tell me where they

587
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,650
live

588
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:50,960
how would you maybe go about doing that
stickers

589
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,480
very good looking at stickers you look
at parking stickers here's up

590
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,300
oil change sticker has an address on it
if it's not where they're parked

591
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,790
if if the address is it for rather park
that's for like where they live

592
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:05,600
you tell stuff like this looking at this
parking lot what does a hacker see

593
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,390
what's the one vehicle that stands out

594
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:10,890
DOT sticker on the red car

595
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:14,040
very nice right there two screens bed

596
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,850
right here's the sticker Military
District of Washington

597
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,520
these things these things are all over
the place

598
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,850
you know but it's it's just back not to
bash the government here

599
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:30,950
but I'm looking at this and I'm like
okay these all say the same thing Fort

600
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,330
George G Meade Maryland have no clue
what's there it's like there's nothing

601
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,090
curly hair

602
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,090
I can't get past the fact that their
like

603
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:42,150
it's the scene thing it's in different
colors and like it's really stupid

604
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,340
up ok for forget how many people have
like yet

605
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:48,790

613
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,110
engineering going

614
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,760
of just ask questions and the social
engineering suddenly now you know

615

it's it's it's it's a disease but

620
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,590
I have this talk Inc so guess it's not
worth it

621
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,320
to get good ones every now and then this
is Fort Huachuca

622
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,900
what you bless you good

623
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:50,429
this is the I had no answer for worsen
Sen

624
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,739

think that would sound better than i did

625
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:54,229
not

626
00:38:54,229 --> 00:38:58,390

of it's a surfer's club

628
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:04,839
thats maybe could be the

629
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:08,828
Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center
now this next picture I

630
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:13,329
I just love this next picture because I
25 death to bring it to you

631
00:39:13,329 --> 00:39:17,890
mean literally this car blows past me
like two hundred miles an hour

632
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:24,890
I'd like to read streak and I realized
it was a Saturn coupe

633
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:28,199
and I thought sums up good

634
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,410
so I eventually caught up with them to
try to

635
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,069
you know figure out which is what was
going on a GI risk my life

636
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:39,529
help have a great car but when I caught
up with this vehicle got a picture

637
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:41,279
license plate I was suddenly berry

638
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:48,279
happy that I was able to keep up have a

639
00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:53,779
it definitely not the funniest or most
ironic vehicle ever gotten picture of

640
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:55,039
about the song

641
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,719
missus is the Trojan horse trucking
company

642
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,430
a contractor for the US Postal Service

643
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,240
the delivers mail so somebody in the
government hired a trucking company

644
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,150
called Trojan horse

645
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,410
right let's try your skills again here

646
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,540
here's a vehicle to warn you right now
before you start profiling this person

647
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,350
you're probably wrong but give it a shot

648
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:27,670
tell me about this person NYU with NYU

649
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,970
yeah cases a college student

650
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:35,300
date they like you max no tall a decoy

651
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,700
its its action it's its a subtle
disguise the

652
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,200
twist with your brain screen all up
because that the figure out what they

653
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,250
really are you have to look at the front
window to

654
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,950
see this its so it's actually a ninja
driving the car

655
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,170
in just screw with you man they do that

656
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,310
gonna watch and stuff I get another
exercise tell me exactly how much money

657
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:59,180
this person makes a year

658
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:04,339
to the penny how would you do it to the
penny

659
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:09,260
tax records to high-tech

660
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:14,150
up are you want the ones that's all the
talk

661
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,310
okay good well yes because the paycheck
is actually sitting on the front seat

662
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,660
there's their earnings statement

663
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:23,868
shows exactly how much money they're
making list their social security number

664
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:24,210
there

665
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:27,890
your bank information a lot source stuff
I i would tell you that is just north of

666
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:30,609
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars
per year

667
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:34,109
because day pay smart people what some
money

668
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:37,330
right skill number five

669
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:41,180
sucking sensitive data from a corporate
network from the parking lot without a

670
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,200
wireless device

671
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,220
some takes a long time to say but it's
it

672
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,369
really comes in handy we could do it
against this building

673
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:53,300
how would we do that exactly right see
this used to be called dumpster diving

674
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,869
which is

675
00:41:53,869 --> 00:41:57,760
10g and has a nice the ultimate news
significantly shorter than sucking

676
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,570
sensitive data from corporate here

677
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,580
but I'm sorry this

678
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,650
is not dumpster diving it

679
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:12,460
it does involve a dumpster but there's
no diving in fact none of these required

680
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,850
dumpster diving this was also a king
date of a corporate network

681
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,029
my wireless device its he just stick
your head in the open door the dumpster

682
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,790
these days

683
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,869
buy stuff like this service order
requests administrative pronounce

684
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:25,280
project diagrams

685
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,740
purchase orders this is a what's thing
you know it's a

686
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,109
white area telephone you guys know what
so here's purchase orders private I'm

687
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:37,150
terror something or others a I don't
know what this is but I can't leave it

688
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,580
on the screen for too long cuz its
proprietary

689
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,049
others this which is a key sales
authorization form

690
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:47,690
this is a salesman how much commission
they made on a contract and their social

691
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,830
security numbers

692
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:52,540
comes in handy here's how it works: you
find a dumpster

693
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,840
you optionally look around to see if
there's people watching

694
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,140
your relevant doesn't seem to matter

695
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,560
actually waved to some people and they
wave packets clever

696
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,920
stick your head in and start taking
pictures

697
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,880
this is the sort of stuff the see
another document can't leave up for very

698
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,480
long its customer confidential
information

699
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,200
here's our health care in voice again
confidential health care information

700
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,290
this is a health care provider actually
throwing away

701
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,300
you know medical data there's this
there's this thing's

702
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,880
really high-tech device that your
suppose that put it in before you put in

703
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:30,070
the trash it's like a pasta machine

704
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:34,980
forget the name of it but its its new
technology art how many how many up

705
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,540
dumpster divers route here many people
can give me give me tell me the best

706
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,029
thing ever found in a dumpster

707
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,080
money from

708
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,140
hats are too big beijing's by the other
stuff with the money you found that's

709
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,868
to what else who

710
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:59,869
that's nice what was on the back who

711
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,780
him nice thats

712
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:09,720
that's well done file that's no tech

713
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,780
but security cards guy/girl lame

714
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,310
come in. I'll and asking

715
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:20,910
away all that sounds cool

716
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,509
lame alright

717
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,109
I we could go on all day but your you
just not gonna beat me on this

718
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:32,770
because I've perfected the skill I found
the coolest thing in a dumpster ever

719
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,700
as long as we can extend it just a
little bit and assume the landfill is

720
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,990
just the big dumpster I

721
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,800
right so I'm driving by landfill

722
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,079
and I see this guy pulling in

723
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:54,079
size I was like dude are you done what
that is like yep so

724
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,670
yeah let the next time somebody tells
about their ass but so it worked but

725
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,479
thinking

726
00:45:02,479 --> 00:45:06,670
sage you think about the Air Force did
you know the pilot that was like

727
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:12,509
cool right skills number six and seven
the jet I wave and the Fed bland a

728
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:15,549
blending in with the feds and having a
conversation with them

729
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:19,849
is yeah I mean it's a it's a valid
skilled Zazzle tell you about fed stuff

730
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,880
a warm up to I'm real quickly get them
talking and you will drink you know it

731
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,200
the just starts coming that's the Fed
blend them there's also the jet i way

732
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,819
which is just a little wave

733
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,849
that makes the guards just like flip out
you know

734
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:38,079
lose their mind and say you can pass
it's the

735
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,979
it's the jet I wave what they both
center on the same exact piece of high

736
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:43,130
technology

737
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,309
about the one seen here in this picture
the batch

738
00:45:47,309 --> 00:45:50,630
right both have the skills require

739
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,630
a very high tech device called a badge

740
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,069
which is a laminated piece of paper on a
lanyard

741
00:45:58,069 --> 00:46:02,479
now you can get very high tech with them
but if you use them properly if you just

742
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:03,999
have it on casually

743
00:46:03,999 --> 00:46:08,519
thank you very nice like this this is
far beyond

744
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,299
it has a button well you

745
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:15,849
it back okay up

746
00:46:15,849 --> 00:46:19,719
if you use the laminated piece a paper
properly like you know you're walking

747
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,199
with a buncha people and you see the
garden you do the wave with the thing

748
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:24,529
the cards will

749
00:46:24,529 --> 00:46:28,410
who works for me alright its the badge
that's a key

750
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:32,229
thing is they're absolutely everywhere
sometimes they travel in packs like here

751
00:46:32,229 --> 00:46:35,959
up in fact you don't even have to go out
of your house to like

752
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:42,890
pick up badges i saw this on online says
the Google recruiting video

753
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,348
like that one here's a more badges all
these badges: were taken at a cookout

754
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:48,839
that I was not invited to

755
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:54,049
they fed me and let me take pictures
their badges nobody noticed that I was

756
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:54,999
shooting low

757
00:46:54,999 --> 00:46:58,029
there's this lady all her junk on her

758
00:46:58,029 --> 00:47:01,930
lanyard in post it notes got a little
note there it says bring a copy of

760
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,170
yes us of course being the Defense
Security Service

761
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,579
you know those people who tell you not
to wear badges in public

762
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:17,329
its species talking to there's these
mysterious blue badges I don't know what

763
00:47:17,329 --> 00:47:18,390
they work for

764
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,199
the feds require

765
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:27,170
good alright so sometimes people put
their badges away and they just you know

766
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,269
the laptop at the site badge away so
that you can take a picture of it for it

767

out copier to believe you know approx
cartel

768
00:47:32,969 --> 00:47:35,969
breaking these is ya very high tech

769
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:40,289
you have to you know there's like RFID
and you have to understand frequencies

770
00:47:40,289 --> 00:47:42,239
and there's this challenge response

771
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:48,160
or you can just use the high-tech
gadgets that are put it on here

772
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,999
put them into a telephone it's a 1-800
number

773
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:55,859
and read the nice lady on the and
numbers at the top in a carton say I

774
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:59,069
worse this thing work I got like 20
cards on an hour and they tell you

775
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:03,369
it works at this building it works at
this place years the door that opens

778
00:48:09,269 --> 00:48:13,809
this badge will let you walk onto

779
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:17,459
the BWI airfield just

780
00:48:17,459 --> 00:48:21,529
you walking onto the airfield I know
you're skeptical ray

781
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:25,699
can't just take a picture that laminated
or whatever and be like the

782
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:29,519
yeah what you mean airfield you actually
want these two

783
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,099
really round out the look close the
clothes really make it you get one of

784
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:35,119
these in your golden

785
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,410
up the problem is its it's not going to
get one of these anytime soon that they

786
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,969
just don't go missing

787
00:48:39,969 --> 00:48:43,029
well

788
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:46,059
the they might go missing but it's not
like one's gonna just show up in my

789
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:46,869
luggage

790
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:52,170
no cause for concern

791
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,029
the other clothes make it you can you
can be just about anybody get the right

792
00:48:57,029 --> 00:48:57,660
clothes

793

anger delivery geyer gas electric iron
phone geyer

794
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,869
whatever just by getting the clothes and
don't think for a second that you have

795
00:49:04,869 --> 00:49:07,339
to be sneaky when you take these
pictures cuz you don't

796
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:10,710
I just walk up to him in like my son
likes big trucks going to have your

797
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:11,279
picture

798
00:49:11,279 --> 00:49:15,229
okay done you have to put me

799
00:49:15,229 --> 00:49:19,119
like enthusiasm into it or social
engineering here just whatever

800
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,239
K just beats or Adobe and it works write
the next skill passing through walls

801
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,130
in a cloud of smoke this is a good one
its

802
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:31,449
it's easier to describe this skill if I
just tell you how to unfolded for me

803
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:36,979
this is I couldn't get in the front door
this is the lady at the smoker entrance

804
00:49:36,979 --> 00:49:40,690
she's got her hand up in answer to my
question which was front doors locked

805
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:42,630
can I get in this way

806
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:46,229
her answer was she waved me in

807
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:53,229
I did sure my badge though

808
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:59,799
split I obviously is photoshopped but

809
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:03,099
about this one accessing locked cabinets
with no hands

810
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:07,480
get someone else to do but they have to
use their hands

811
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,599
like a chicken-and-egg problem needed

812
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,819
do with your face you could be the navy
chief and a big

813
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:19,279
through with your head or you just

814
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:23,509
for a walk along evidence up

815
00:50:23,509 --> 00:50:26,769
as I said accessing locked cabinet that
incident opening

816
00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:30,710
be careful how you phrase these skills
at %uh this is great because the

817
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:34,220
long-haul fiber cabinet he answers your
instructions on like how to apply choir

818
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,930
stuff up

819
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:39,098
has great right defeating physical
security with junk and stuff

820
00:50:39,099 --> 00:50:44,759
skill number nine pick the most secure
lock ok a pic is a bad choice in

821
00:50:44,759 --> 00:50:48,069
select the most secure lock

822
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:53,319
here here quick look at tonight's really
gonna be locking up Superman

823
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:58,058
well we'll start with that one hears the
Kryptonite house a broken

824
00:50:58,059 --> 00:51:05,059
very nice use a pen here's how it's done
the right to lock turn

825
00:51:05,490 --> 00:51:08,589
pops open nice write a break this one

826
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:11,750
shame very good but high-tech

827
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,519
sort of high-tech pumping even more
high-tech hammer

828
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:19,059
I like the hammer track means you have a
hammer in your pocket little bulky

829
00:51:19,059 --> 00:51:23,470
so we're going from high-tech to medium
attack to slimming down

830
00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:26,549
them some you can pull open but

831
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:30,269
I think it's more fun to just use the
flaw service but the electric flosser

832
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:33,849
sniff the end of their print lock turned
on

833
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:38,509
you lock pick gun

834
00:51:38,509 --> 00:51:44,230
nice here's a guide on how do you how to
get into the swing

835
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:49,150
very nice and I say thank you to follow
thank you very well as you guys

836
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:53,329
absolutely rockers barry shown you how
it's done erode the toilet paper roll up

837
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:55,349
into a little cylinder cut a piece of it

838
00:51:55,349 --> 00:51:58,869
you're going to get unlock you switch to
a little bit

839
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:05,869
he said aunt

840
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:12,140
open me right about this one

841
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:16,259
shame still little technical not as
funny as well I got

842
00:52:16,259 --> 00:52:20,579
I think you all set it but yeah

843
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:23,970
me use these right you can bird force it

844
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,250
yea put a little yet but a little up
tension on there and it's got sticking

845
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,819
points all the way around the lock

846
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:33,150
right doesn't work with all the works at
most to them you find sticking points

847
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,259
all around the dial for example this one

848
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:38,640
sticks at 1.5 this one sticks it eighty

849
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:42,299
you map all the sticking points all the
way around the lock little table here

850
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:43,869
they are down the right hand side

851
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,329
get rid of all the ones that aren't a
whole number you're left with the list

852
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:49,700
get rid of all the ones that end in the
same number

853
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,920
you're left with one number if that's
the third did you have your lock you've

854
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,660
got a problem

855
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,700
if that is the third interview lock

856
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,809
little mod four and two minutes worth of
effort

857
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:03,799
you can get this lock open knocks it
down to about a hundred combinations

858
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:08,779
two minutes so the answer to this
security problem is never to let any of

859
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:12,950
this in your buildings

860
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,660
see crazy when you get into like
defending stuff a complicated gets

861
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,170
you imagine telling people more toilet
paper at the big speak problem

862
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,820
have no work and you have anything to
wipe with them

863
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,390
not going down there

864
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:36,390
it's actually easier just to put up
signs anyway

865
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,330
you just it's fun to just watch people
queue up begets

866
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:46,930
it's great another another trash attack
years I love the gap on the store

867
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,040
so it's just begging for problem looking
down you can actually

868
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,170
you know see all that the yummy parts a
looking at the trash can just outside

869
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,820
the door I see this nice okay boys take
the cable down there pop the door open

870
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:02,660
using trash to the few blocks about the
feeding these cameras this is Rs and/or

871
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,080
as

872
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,470
very cool stuff on the subject of the
book heavy defeat these cameras

873
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:11,450
very nice here's the security camera

874
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,450
before here's the security camera after
shining a light into it

875
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:20,800
now is a good talk in a in the previous
talk is very nicely talked about simplex

876
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,890
locks I thought that was really slick

877
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:26,440
I mean bike even the movies and
everything was really cool um

878
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,940
of course one of the biggest problems
that these locks is that you have to put

879
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,130
the combination in

880
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:35,100
in front of people that server problems
I thought to myself let me find the most

881
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,770
secure facility that uses wannabes

882
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:41,220
and I'll see if I can like capture so I
went to the airport

883
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,130
found the TSA lock to win and camped out

884
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:52,130
here's what I found: C if it's even
catch it

885
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:57,430
the less messy than the whole unit
worked with thing and push them

886
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:00,830
as the pilot ready room here's the
pilots getting ready for their flight I

887
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,470
shoulder serfdom I was doing and got a
picture is bad

888
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:06,810
um II again think signs are the answer

889
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:13,810
really gotta I right so as I wrap up

890
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,220
I just wanna talk about this little
special it was on called unsolved

891
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,940
history

892
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,590
love the ninjas on Discovery Channel
basically what they did is they

893
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:25,540
they built this little facility it was
one floor had windows and one entrance

894
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:31,040
and they wanted to see how Navy SEALs
and ninjas in both approach the problem

895
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:31,369
love

896
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:34,619
up getting to a target

897
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:38,340
inside this facility so they hired Bruce
carting us to come in so the security

898
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,760
guys and they decided we're gonna put
him in the bath tub in the bathroom

899
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,280
there's no windows

900
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,900
the rules are if you take the half of
the guy you win

901
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,420
so the seals came in dressed up like
ninjas brought their tree man

902
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:53,119
jus nice the tree man's neighbor told
them the guards patterns

903
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:58,560
and here's our went down the seals made
short work of the guards using surprise

904
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,820
and overwhelming firepower to get to
their target

905
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,510
but how would a ninja face will he be
able to get past the guards

906
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:11,710
him can see why I'm intrigued right how
with the ninja fair

907
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:15,070
so then they bring in the ninja honest
to god Steven Hayes he's

908
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,300
you know studied under Hatsumi sensei
he's the real thing

909
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,330
approach this problem and the seals were
high tech

910
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,759
and the ninja was no techno

911
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,840
I was completely and utterly
disappointed because yeah

912
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,820
I'm thinking manger there's gonna be
Dehat years get beheadings in like blood

913
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,320
squirting in lecture can flying in the
morn

914
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,800
beheadings and many more explosions I
shoulda known better

915
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,940
isn't practicing the art but that's not
how it went down at all

916
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:48,940
here's how it went down bad it okay is
over four hours to wear down the cards

917
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:51,780
and successfully reach the target

918
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:56,700
when I enjoyed about this assigned
mission why's it was an opportunity

919
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:00,270
to really showed people how the new job
would operate

920
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:04,480
by going in without any over weapons I
actually allowed me to move

921
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,420
right into the middle of all that danger
is okay I just got 11 spread

922
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,710
right there I got duped by am i mean it
was believable

923
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:15,430
that he was up the maintenance guy nice
for

924
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,369
so ninja put on a hat grabs the latter
and some compressed air

925
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:24,100
walks right into the hot zone as the
maintenance guy and security guards

926
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,320
didn't shoot him cuz he was bring
cameras

927
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,460
that was it talk about no te kayaking
but this only works for individuals

928
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,280
sometimes need to get a whole group in

929
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,840
so I found a way to do that this is some
historical documentation I dug up to

930
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,520
show you how to get a grip inside

931
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:45,520
and

932
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:52,880
ok

933
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:59,410
ok

934
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:06,410
good

935
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:12,210
acted upon

936
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:19,210
but what I'm do

937
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,940

938
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:29,940

00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,820

941
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:44,590
