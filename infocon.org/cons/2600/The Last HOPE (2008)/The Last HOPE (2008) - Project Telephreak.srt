knows his what people use it for
nowadays

31

and use it and honestly not worry about
any kind of locking everything is we

51
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,860
plug or anything but

52
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,620
a I'm a beef to the death row cluster
and a few guys know what that is anybody

53
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,270
know that is

54
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,740
past week ago yeah I am

55
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,030
its it's an awesome thing is actually
there aren't that many

56
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,990
open VMs systems that you can mess with
but I'll out there

57
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,040
and by the way it open VMs doesn't have
any random number generator

58
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,700
enough to do that and how I like messing
with a lot

59
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,910
and a be friends place you want to place
actually

60
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,750
right store that along with it met
through that min yeah we got a break up

61
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,950
telephone study a

62
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,800
we on fire near system right notified
yeah school

63
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,530
skirmish in a now we like to hang out
the talk to channel their

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,480
arm in the Notes system which is
essentially a text BBS for more years

65
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,980
and its internal to the open VMs closer
there

66
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,050
mom but so we used to hang on talking on
talk about this that and the other

67
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,390
and we had another friend the robot

68
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,700
he was like a man's Astros things pretty
cool

69
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,460
you know this is about two thousand
three years on so we started messing

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:57,800
with

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,970
and for his unit was really incredibly
bloody software

72
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,040
brands but that on an iPhone still is
other stuff on this day

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,429
that's right I wanted yeah

74
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,580
size and reversals you know so as
Microsoft Windows so

75
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,090
no nursery and how

76
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,950
a we r took on Asher says do something
interesting look into you

77
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,380
and it turned out they would do all
kinds of things that we had always

78
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,210
wanted to use kids that we would have
gotten through to Jill

79
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,719
as kids for doing actually ironically
the only reason I started using it was

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,920
I couldn't get my a my Sep formwork

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,510
had a choice between sopra see or ass
trick to use it

82
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,810
a course pic much more complex on the
set up in

83
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,950
you working so months generally I'd

84
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,159
yeah awesome with sanity sir body else

85
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,389
I mean good alignment you might turn to
three people out there who actually

86
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,880
listens off the hook you might recognize
me i'm not Kevin

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,200
and I'm its and I kinda came into the
scene and tell a freak once they start

88
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,750
getting our act together and got the
conference together

89
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,060

I have no idea like when cycle have
quite recall

91
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,389
I was kinda brought in as the guy who
brings everything

92
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:19,320
and as you actually get software comment
I cast names a number of times I was

93
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,840
banned from the conference for breaking
your loyal some

94
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,240
at least a dozen times now yes where in

combination of things happen but a

100

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,180
yeah I want one time another two in most
the term nervous

154
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,940
really live anywhere near each other oh
then these two years

155
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,350
that's Daniel in these mutations that's
only a in recent times

156
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,990
I'm good I

157
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,360
yeah I'm generally the asshole that
tends to kick people off a buyer see

158
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:16,120
and as on down anybody who tends to be a
general nuisance

159
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,520
I'm responsible for writing about ninety
percent of the software that you see on

160
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,240
television

161
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,350
aside from asterisk itself which did you

162
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,279
has done a awesome job on buddy says

163
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,390
these guys for they came up with a
really cool system

164
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,140
really early on I got a chance to be a
part of it back in 2003

165
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,970
I just graduated high school and i was
just kinda playing around with asterisks

166
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,820
just

167
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,910
tinkering with boy came across 2609 to
scan a played around with that

168
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,569
and rodent introduced me to use please
stack and believe

169
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,140
at actually don't think he introduced me
to be that

170
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,680
the following Def Con been to the
Afghans later met believe

171
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,470
but I'm from the West Coast night
generally attend Def Con

172
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,310
not really New York side but

173
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,779
you know it's it's been a really
interesting ride so far been released

174
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:13,910
used to call in very early on and hang
out with only tries to hang of balancing

175
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:14,810
our

176
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,649
time in like Irene researcher on
endlessly but yeah I like

177
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:22,730
I'm on a few people who are still in the
conference world who

178
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:26,649
actually no tryin fortunately he's still
in jail

179
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,720
as I said officials yesterday Mike I
know that I know that his release your

180
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,390
own sometime this month

181
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:36,670
bird if anybody can reserve fighters for
me I'd appreciate

182
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,849
said we feel like you're in danger
something will

183
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,940
silica is pretty spooky victim of maybe

184
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,260
to doesn't pay phones insists is used to
the what this is

185
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,600
this is why we have the world's only
hacker dog I said

186
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,300
he specializes in packet sniffing and
intrusion detection

187
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,380
and he does the authentication once
you've been packets nest

188
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,450
sanitize nice

189
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,720
he takes care you know in return to me a
great picture have said rack-mounted

190
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,700
competing in track is 19 and San 23-inch
curable

191
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,700
you he's pretty versatile

192
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,399
work some pretty much anything see goes
wonderfully give a little background on

193
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,330
what we're doing right now

194
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:19,060
your power is a good you can probably
explain it better and I can

195
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,740
this we'll see you know against us yeah
I can probably do more technical that

196
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,260
you can

197
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,610
give the broader stroke I don't will
this go back to the original intention

198
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,149
love

199
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:32,459
toll free in the first place from you
about spelling sucks

200
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:36,540
well those you know early but the
original intention behind the voicemail

201
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,890
systems we really were started was a

202
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:42,010
to could vote the Swiss bank account for
voicemail

203
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,029
where we don't know you are and we don't
wanna know

204
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:49,439
and you know people criticize that a
little bit here and there not

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,160
do you believe it a little bit arms
being like something that you know

206
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,939
terrorists might use or whatever

207
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,330
you know they're the people the few your
privacy well thing is that you know the

208
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,190
terrace use

209
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,870
AT&T's network salt I'm sorry leaves you
with but the point is

210
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,200
you know whatever you think a terrorist
is in so

211
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,920
so anyways you your idealism anonymity
rates

212
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,260
into so now we're we're extending the

213
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,220
idea here and also one other part 2
which is essentially toll-free

214
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,870
is built I love used in acquired

215
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,250
machinery believe donates been with

216
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,880
because he's got it and also the
electricity as well

217
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,439
and why expertise course on then we all
donate our time in

218
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,880
energy and ideas so

219
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,480
this project your hope this year is
similar

220
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,529
and a and we try to work on it you're in
there

221
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,610
before we got here per century we are
kinda knew was going to happen

222
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,860
last-second because no matter how we
plan something it just doesn't

223
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,350
necessarily go that way

224
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,260
although the effect can be the same
right so well we got here we actually

225
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,689
star working on here and there awaited
for the network to come up

226
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,060
and several times sometimes would which
is you know it's working awesome those

227
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,660
geyser

228
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,260
died yeah X yep definitely thank you
very much for your personal data

229
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,430
the knock guys yeah yeah Knox awesome
Pitman

230
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:16,880
yeah so we're any help on basically
everything is brought here the

231
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,600
conference so you can use at your
leisure

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,390
on this may not a garbage and I mean
that

233
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,500
it's actually use every gun dollars
finance

234
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,709
rate know to let me everything on site
but we saw it appears

235
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,880
recycle self it is it's all research
cycle phones so used to given to us

236
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,510
reduced

237
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,230
happen upon or whatever even the
Ethernet cables which we are to replace

238
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,500
quite a few summer those who knew him

239
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,600
and how the whole the whole theory
behind was a screw something fun and

240
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,130
useful for the conference

241
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,170
and so I'm hoping that we actually are
achieving she was murdered

242
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,100
if you guys don't have any features or
not we can always get this got a code

243
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,680
yeah he was your idea is for real

244
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,790
you try to do here with Miami you're
basically

245
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,290
on the I'm the weirdo just kinda sits
there takes up your ideas and kinda

246
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,930
make some work and then we shipping back
to us and we breaking

247
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:10,279
yeah break and then I debts and drink
more beer

248
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:14,200
through a buyer pulse a few beard a

249
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,220
essentially its split up into two
separate servers we have a server here

250
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,100
locally

251
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,709
hear the knock for our services like
outbound dialing

252
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:26,290
international dialing whatnot I nor also

253
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,269
kinda starting to integrate some ball
games and some little fun listen to it

254
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,769
so that a princes aqui have just at a
local server here

255
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:39,560
I am it you can just tell the system
just dial something interesting

256
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,390
and you might get Virgin Airlines more
formerly

257
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,699
calls and says we're connect you to the
aircraft now for

258
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,740
you know you might get dark

259
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,730
I feel like it how it seems so we have a
whole list randomly picks out

260
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,769
so even if you don't know anybody wanna
call

261
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:01,350
is let the system decide to do it for
you Unni find yourself surprise me like

262
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,680
wow that's really

263
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,130
silly for you actually let me clarify
how you dial that

264
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,130
right now to you essentially the way the
the features are gonna work throughout

265
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,010
the conference's you down nine if you
wanna feature

266
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,079
or use dial out seeking dozier 11 or

267
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,839
one in your number in August call him
every down

268
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,250
0 internationals if it were now the the
elevator

269
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,480
elevator system we could think that
after exiting on committed by the

270
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,769
elevators

271
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:31,680
people are getting stuck in them see
will get the chance I

272
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,570
we saw a bunch more elevators from New
York elevator leave school yeah

273
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,880
yes we know if you guys have any
questions to you I feel free to ask 'em

274
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,639
anytime you want like even now knows
this whole system here later

275
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,529
we literally started putting it together
two days ago

276
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,000
here know the really last night actual
last night around

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
yeah so much more about yeah maybe 3
o'clock in the morning or some

278
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,870
not yet yeah

279
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,440
you know world technically we're not an
Internet service provider and we're not

280
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,110
providing actual pay for service or does
it live up to any obligations

281
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,100
anybody as were classified as a hobby is
service

282
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,220
so being as a we're just playing around
where technically in the free and clear

283
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
for the moment

284
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,310
interesting enough we have Kadima of on

285
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,769
we still haven't won a different
conference numbers say ciao

286
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,310
we set it up insanely characters but
like people weren't interest in

287
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,139
electronics go to this one room and we
realize your

288
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,630
if you're interested 1x going to this
one criminals kinda stupid so we can put

289
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,600
it back to

290
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,870
just a couple a general doc conferences
and we notice one-day

291
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,480
that a a some people were on the
conference

292
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,860
to a or they doing it again

293
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,120
producing and something about Western
Union credit card number yeah

294
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,450
some and we quickly to care yeah but arm

295
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,559
so basically we didn't drop their docs
with and mail them to the Fed's wouldn't

296
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,079
do anything stupid like that

297
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,530
what we did with simply just banned them
from our system

298
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,649
the point as leaders voicemail thanks
who don't know it

299
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,839
must have issues for and you know some
the criticisms that

300
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,240
I've heard is like you now well what
drug dealers are using it

301
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,799
like ya and

302
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,879
so citizens to them free service

303
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,620
if drug deal dealers need voicemails
well

304
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,150
you actually I guess what we're seeing a
search leader's a voicemail to

305
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,500
week we can get in trouble for anything
these days

306
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,830
I mean there's really no way to follow
all seven and a half million lines cross

307
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:43,668
the state's

308
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,960
in the for dollar mmm I'm not really
sure if that's humanly possible I'm sure

309
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,640
you could look it up he spent the rest
of your life doing just that it's not

310
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,350
like that but

311
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:54,649
for arm we were not breaking lawmen were

312
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,700
were offering a service through the free
really

313
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:04,700
are you use it as your business so they
were not interested in

314
00:18:10,639 --> 00:18:13,590
we don't have any logs have any so yeah
we don't

315
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,259
and they could do that because they can
do whatever they want yeah

316
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:21,999
you know tell a freak itself does not
actually log any call detail reports

317
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:26,769
we do not actually teachers our house is
your records on the conference

318
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:33,769
gonna weed on the public unions
basically what you can do is you can

319
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,999
essentially

320
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:38,330
band the caller ID number or name

321
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,230
have any given person through the
blacklist function an asterisk and keep

322
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,629
in mind these guys are completely

323
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,350
holes oh yeah lights so II LRT

324
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,220
one guy was practicing as rap on the
bridge Monday oh yeah he was doing that

325
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,039
it was rapping on the bridge we listen
to

326
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,549
real great I he was terrible

327
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:02,190
yeah yeah

328
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,259
yes and that as

329
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:09,619
and nature lovers in the past but
through

330
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:13,529
network means for instance I P tables we
can literally just dropped their IP

331
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:14,230
address

332
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:17,970
so at that point you just have to
reappear IP address

333
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:21,320
and for most people that's more the pain
in the butt to reset your cable modem

334
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,249
into

335
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,879
because it would move along so knows it
takes a little bit diligence just two

336
00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:29,960
closer to rate in the conference's
cousin when they come back once or twice

337
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,820
and still someone kicking him out in
their

338
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,149
nerd when our sources also we found ways

339
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:39,659
annoying people who annoy us to snow who

340
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:43,149
you should come about the outcome the
different ways that we can transfer

341
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:43,710
people

342
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,519
yeah we have a number different
extension so we call them that we can

343
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,179
to ask people if we don't like them for
instance it's cool 42

344
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,669
in six forty six &2 resist just stupid
song in mind I have

345
00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:01,759
or I A recording basically somebody
prank calling the RIAA

346
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,889
for now phone there's one at a phone on
Rafi's banana phone

347
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:08,909
course now the one that I always wanna
do is get like me

348
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:12,559
you Inslee stack on their in this record
a conversation with his so that whenever

349
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,889
we transfer them

350
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:16,499
of the conference they still think
they're on the conference serve

351
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:17,169
somebody's

352
00:20:17,169 --> 00:20:20,830
settings are returning the conference
for like a few hours we did that

353
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,918
okay we actually didn't do recording but
it was just like the conference is back

354
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,549
basically based on caller ID

355
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:31,470
in basically the idea is that the old
think they're still performing the

356
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,179
conference

357
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:36,619
when in actuality I'm and reality
they're just talking to them so turning

358
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,369
a black room for nothing

359
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:41,559
does it matter only a low immune

360
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,590
time but commuting works well I L

361
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,070
yeah you don't tends to be more %uh very
first time offense like if you're just

362
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:52,970
like echoing for instance a lot of
people calling through VoIP phones for

363
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,669
the first time through their computers

364
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,549
and I'll just automatically like to
serve a speakerphone and a pair of

365
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,668
and a pair of speakers just set up an

366
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:05,769
oftentimes they just create a nice

367
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:10,259
ako complex does lots of ways you can
get on the system either be at the ID

368
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:13,879
towards direct by IP address VI axis
said

369
00:21:13,879 --> 00:21:17,099
so a lot of people experimenting with
their was a repeat

370
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,519
in a Google Images fine tell a freakin
so we get them on their lot of times and

371
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:22,429
so they get like me

372
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:26,200
get guys a fuck to the you know I'm do
with Boyd

373
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,230
yeah but for the most part it's fairly
straightforward to

374
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,749
to connect to the bridge literally just
through what's called a dide

375
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:39,249
or a direct inward dial it's the century
just a regular telephone number that

376
00:21:39,249 --> 00:21:41,570
connects directly to the box

377
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,619
in other ways through the gateways which

378
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:48,340
is essentially third sir third-party
service provider

379
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,499
money then have like an extra extension
dinner

380
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:56,070
number on after their box in other ways
internationally

381
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,210
once again through the ID's are gateways
and

382
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,710
too far fourth and final ways through
directly into the box

383
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,529
over VoIP itself we currently support
both set up an IMAX clients

384
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:12,379
and yeah it's it's pretty nifty

385
00:22:12,379 --> 00:22:15,989
anyway well the go as we have a local
circle here

386
00:22:15,989 --> 00:22:19,440
that would so we plan to set up some
games and stuff like that

387
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,470
and we have a server hosted externally
because

388
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:26,529
we were gonna be secure on how well the
band with this can work here

389
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:29,720
and renewed she accident think

390
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,909
made work rains gotta know it's the
break now

391
00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:35,960
you know your box know I'll crap mean

392
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,119
I because I work with us we have

393
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,330
an external box showing that people
around the world I went to you

394
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:45,599
and you know you're talking the
conference

395
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,080
you talk to people on the phones
downstairs we've set it up so that a

396
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,359
people can around the world Thailand
just

397
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,779
ringer on confuse and pick it up
populism

398
00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:00,230
jerk announced earlier use you own or
something like that so om Yun Kim

399
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,159
can fish Union I'm for resident at the
conference

400
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,359
and that's pretty much how it works

401
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,649
between 27 were adding in more features
were a little bit behind

402
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:16,629
very very tired I am have a coffee and
beer

403
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:20,769
yeah has been pretty much died where
they can they can bring

404
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:24,649
send ugh for this thing for me so far as
the

405
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:27,789
the eighties were using actually allow
us to use

406
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:33,039
Polestar telephones without any extra
stuff going on

407
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,190
they convert the posted humor here or

408
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,299
juror which headed to star in pound no
does anybody know how to

409
00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:44,099
use their pool stuff phone dial phone to
you were dial star power

410
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:48,139
they but im I thought was hit with under
11 Requip

411
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,149
11 2011 at I tried it I tried the

412
00:23:51,149 --> 00:23:58,149
mature again I is still a possibly a

413
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,570
primary

414
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:09,189
these have

415
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:16,190
just 29 and try to dial phone number
after you down I'm

416
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,419
right combos one I'll

417
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:27,149
no actually 101 as the cause something
something interesting here

418
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:30,379
yeah no actually here in there
throughout the day today

419
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:34,039
we've been kinda trouble shooting things
and kinda you know you want it

420
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,739
picked up a phone that was being worked
on you know does redoing all those came

421
00:24:37,739 --> 00:24:38,210
over

422
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,799
yeah actually a lot of the Ethernet
cables we had worked with were very cool

423
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:45,200
so if mister once again like we only
started

424
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,820
really putting together the Ivy are
yesterday's that most most everything

425
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,939
that youre saying on there's the result
the last 24 hours

426
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,369
what's on the fly for what we need
building features for what people are

427
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,600
asking for you knows

428
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,029
X entirely the resort to our last minute
procrastination

429
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:04,830
its will if you guys if you guys have
any of your own phones to you feel free

430
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,379
to come up and now we got a couple extra
its years will even plug sockets are

431
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:09,019
there

432
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:13,379
and I could write on was rounded stuff
Murphy other features

433
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:20,379
or anything like that you cousin nothing
Oaks

434
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:25,960
it's all free only you know the the day
would only be charged for

435
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,619
if their service provider but charge
them porn and down call

436
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:34,169
basically we're we're not collecting any
rates on these and we're actually paying

437
00:25:34,169 --> 00:25:35,090
out of pocket

438
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:40,330
for for this service actually be
approximately how much money have we

439
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,139
spent today

440
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:47,190
today I looked at it we have spent I
think it's about six dollars and fifty

441
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,179
yes need to make more sales yeah so many
of whom are calling a box isn't

442
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:55,639
yeah no mark as cock

443
00:25:55,639 --> 00:26:02,639
excellent international column yeah up

444
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:07,200
with our cheap American dollar I

445
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,619
no doubt now I live in America literally
like

446
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:14,619
the band with this graciously donated
from viv and his work

447
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:19,960
actually and Rome and the box for tele
for Quinn got that from

448
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,230
from a caucasian and dollars in answer
to: hours

449
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,779
know the DOD user actually oftentimes
free

450
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:34,639
for says and on providers as see likes
to make money off

451
00:26:34,639 --> 00:26:38,450
long distance charges to those d ID's

452
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:41,789
we actually don't pay a cent for it in
exchange

453
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:45,840
your regular phone companies are already
making the rates just through

454
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,330
normal service yeah we're just we're
gonna pull up some inbounds more of the

455
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:49,720
time

456
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,210
your no images offer just Adi ID that
goes vs

457
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,659
or I tax to where you point it we
pointed to the telecast

458
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,119
and literally all that that does it just
takes a regular phone number

459
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,129
and since it into VoIP protocol and

460
00:27:04,129 --> 00:27:08,779
we just pick it up wherever we have our
ass response hosted world seizing said

461
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:09,289
occur

462
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:13,289
which gives us a a lotta international
inbound I called

463
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:20,289
you're sitting in Argentina you can dial
in

464
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,460
we signed up for their service

465
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,850
Germany for calls know the company the
companies they make money off

466
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,240
and on termination either via tariffs or

467
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,929
be a long distance terminations so we
get the ID for free

468
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,809
inbound friends making outbound calls a
day and so the sea like that offers the

469
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,000
ID they make like chump change of

470
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,710
by giving us free about you could pick
up one didn pointed to where ever you

471
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,789
want to be a separate

472
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:56,210
I ax and do just that you can literally
get a free

473
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:59,510
VoIP telephone number just by signing a
free service

474
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,370
like 10

475
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:07,080
actually live you call if I take calls a
broker

476
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,220
i axed if you take a look at the web
page that I have displayed right now

477
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,340
it's Rd ID access page

478
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:17,789
and on that page we actually say who are
provider for each one of these studies

479
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:18,710
is

480
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:24,029
said numbers just one that I recently
found their standoff on their site P

481
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:24,580
call

482
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,720
so I mean did not extend accepting stand
firm

483
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,059
stand-alone business telephone number
tonight Cup the said Becca

484
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,580
yeah and as for murder we have we have a
telephone numbers specifically for a

485
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,510
conference

486
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,010
so next break the phone to ring give out
your friends

487
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,740
a.m. stand next from for one hour

488
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:48,870
give two pizza delivery guy frustrated
me because in the nurses

489
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:52,110
nice for anonymizer yourself for
instance you know

490
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,350
who don't want to give out your cell
phone number 20 hope attendees it's

491
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:01,270
probably a good idea to just 4.3 raster
sparks through one of these freidy ID's

492
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:04,539
just jump in for a second

493
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:08,919
since ya know how yeah can abuse our
callers and all other problems even

494
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:09,539
having

495
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,190
we kinda jumper with the most important
aspects of the actual project matters

496
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,480
the conference itself

497
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,890
in in essence it really brings back the
old

498
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:21,610
school free community and the perfect
example that is

499
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,669
in China when the Great Firewall one up
we had callers coming

500
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:28,940
all over China calling into the
conference and talking to us about

501
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,830
things that were not being reported in
you know major media outlets

502
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,240
we were the first to know you know
because people down their way

503
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,530
around firewall to call our conference
you know being

504
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:43,620
their own system at in essence is you're
the one but a conference about

505
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:47,429
I think that tell a free kind of
embodies libertarian idea

506
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:51,760
being able to have free speech no matter
where you are in the world

507
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,020
so despite being in america being in a
foreign country

508
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,360
songs you have internet access telephone
access you can share your opinion

509
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:04,780
order hear the opinions of others I
think that is a

510
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,149
really important thing that a lot of
people tend to overlook and offering we

511
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:11,409
want everyone to be able to use it

512
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,120
want to be free and when i text instead
of just how consigning

513
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,220
that's what it's all about you know just
having a buncha guys just sit around

514
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,780
drinking beers on on the conference just

515
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:24,250
to future night I

516
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:27,770
idea then like it

517
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:31,490
it can be pretty fun like I've come up
with some really creative stuff just by

518
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,440
sitting around talking with SLE stack on
the phone beer makes me smarter minutes

519
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:35,820
with

520
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:39,200
on own like a vital matters

521
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,289
help slow down the brand logo there may
be focus

522
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:46,799
yeah whatever any other questions from

523
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,090
who use to

524
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,409
yeah actually no use to um newsstand

525
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:58,840
final have been killed at 10 when we
move that are well get some

526
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,429
aka we used to house them up but you
know through maintenance and the just

527
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:04,260
the changes its policy in time you know

528
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,620
I thought we had some up yeah it's
possible here is you don't let Sam Bass

529
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,380
up

530
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,559
well why not you know it's just you use
that type of equipment you know

531
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,649
now a lot of people are doing more and
so you have it like we got the junk land

532
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,539
around say

533
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,580
I got the idea of the phone line now
playing and reduced I

534
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,428
yeah actually there's there's one other
service up there too thats loosely

535
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,960
connected with free world I love

536
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,389
thats astronomer the neighborhood I I
know it does but a

537
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:37,429
ft ft and have to be happy about the

538
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,580
out that's the limit a exiting the ship
down

539
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,020
know it's still around a I think they
changed names Dan

540
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,370
I was just there the other day so anyhow
on that service if you have if you have

541
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,340
a others remind you can share it

542
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,700
using asterisk and essentially

543
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,960
Cupra you you know accrue credits over
period time in for like these for every

544
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,669
call

545
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:01,880
the passes through your line are you 10
credits

546
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,240
in you can dial anywhere that their
dialplan work in this

547
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,320
everywhere its it's a larger worst for
like for like torrent for

548
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,879
telephone calls your was israel is how
it is

549
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,100
it's really funny facts move people to
you on that because

550
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,929
actually the first thing I did with was
call out and then to my own self of

551
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:21,840
course and see who

552
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,260
I was using we know where the line was
and stuff so I called levels while do

553
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,350
you like astor's

554
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,379
its kinda cool as you like pretty close
to means I

555
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:32,850
music yeah I love it member I can't get
a job doing it so

556
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,600
would you guys know was cool others and
want to work out there

557
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,629
boy the stairs discuss that really but

558
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:43,010
is fun Muslim India you having

559
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:50,010
cue

560
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,190
I scanned page I kaelin's

561
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,520
did you notice cam projects

562
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,399
an

563
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,940
I will first question good while Road

564
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,940
project of freehand with PHP interest

565
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,760
his cuteness car cam project done at and
lets people diss

566
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,510
setup cam you know upload to the FTP and

567
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,030
just for you know cam it easy were yeah

568
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,168
so there's a picture of their and the
can want a more permanent residences on

569
00:33:32,169 --> 00:33:33,270
the conference from

570
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,010
for most unusual strength guns brought
visit the bottom under

571
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,929
yeah I is you know is down here at the
bonhomie is the only guy who just

572
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:42,520
doesn't have his picture

573
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,980
dolls okay I think I know what it is and
there's some modules that come

574
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,530
with asks if you compile balance and
stuff like that and it's an ass tricks

575
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,010
to radio interface

576
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,669
kinda like I roll P dotnet for ham
radios well as

577
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:00,960
us as a couple ako stink I'm Sayaka link

578
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,370
downs but don't use it but a these

579
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,409
also stuff for Astrix to murder 3 have
our country's

580
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:12,159
and it's a nice way to do it but no
one's really capitalized on

581
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,730
by cuz it's poorly documented and the
hardware is an easy to put together

582
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:19,659
soul you know ham operators and they may
be smart but this still gotta

583
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,399
or so quite a few kid is really do
yourself to you he likes to do things

584
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:24,638
his own way

585
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,869
and noms so I yeah I'm in a long time
ago on

586
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,050
took forever but I iPhone listen to my
car so good

587
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:35,300
try some stuff for whatever this is the
tedium card with reports in

588
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,619
the BIOS I with her and that he buys
days

589
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:42,220
yeah it's on the second question is if
I've done any stuff

590
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,169
I've looked at it a lot and been kinda
waiting for it to develop and mature a

591
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:46,908
little bit more

592
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:51,589
I've done a lot of radio 2 Voice over IP
interfaces with ira p

593
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,790
but I haven't done a lot faster I really
liked it because the functionality is

594
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:56,080
like endless its

595
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,900
pretty awesome

596
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,020
notes its to a with ira p yeah

597
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,980
into like you can either do it from like
mass text Astrix or from phone

598
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,700
to radio or radio to radio with
batteries in the middle I mean

599
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,250
the possibilities are endless with this
so I haven't done it yet but I've been

600
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,950
looking for the code base to develop a
little bit more and get a little more

601
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,310
documentation

602
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,380
eyes just don't have the time to really
with it but

603
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,030
now thing about asterisk is it's a very
malleable

604
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:28,580
Pisa software itself yes you have the
time you can pretty much really

605
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,779
making anything with her loving home
star you can literally do anything by

606
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,690
interfacing

607
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:38,089
a telephone to a computer basically you
can even wait by the server with

608
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:41,819
saucer manner I met people who build

609
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:46,990
animatronic robots that interface
through asterisk I've met people who've

610
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,210
shot honor built law options like turn
off and on lights in their home just by

611
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,390
calling their home phone number

612
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,629
doing we used to have some stuff maybe
so that still up scanners plugged in you

613
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,799
you can go anywhere from toll-free
nearly 20 percent listen to radio

614
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:02,660
Slayers

615
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,330
right off the telly resolve right yeah

616
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,720
systems back to you lynn WBAI

617
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,510
yeah we we even have live radio streams
right through asterisk on fubar

618
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,880
main pp accts absolutely yet actually
gives you a direct interface this body

619
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,950
language on system that you know use in

620
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:25,589
as well through the AG I or actually
straight it's a system calls 'em

621
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:29,619
all kinds of stuff yes you're either the
a GI interface or through the manager

622
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,010
interface you're able to

623
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,799
literally control asterisk or have ass
risk control something for you

624
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:39,230
which is pretty cool and

625
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:42,819
beautiful thing about house risk you
know it's all open source

626
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:48,009
I mean we've been free to modifier talk
with it as much as we like an

627
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,390
just put it out there we do put our
source code upon tell a prick dork slash

628
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,040
code

629
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,259
if anybody ever wants to check it out
that's what this page looks i care

630
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,950
it's fairly straightforward literally we
whenever we write some little stupid

631
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:05,960
scripture modify another script we
literally just throw

632
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:09,910
that peace accord up their own toll-free

633
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,640
at the moment I'm actually working on a
couple little panel switch

634
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,618
I'll probably be publishing right after
hope this year

635
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:21,859
basically real straightforward just
loves you see all active channels on

636
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:24,160
current PB acts like for instance the
sky

637
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,549
hear from the 27 is called into

638
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:31,339
our box wherever years were able to see
that

639
00:37:31,339 --> 00:37:35,869
this guys come in and through Kentucky
in we can find all the information on

640
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:36,380
its

641
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,770
service provider all that stuff without
really needing to

642
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,210
do anything funky one thing is

643
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,240
like when we're using just the normal
Teleflex system we don't give out

644
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,780
anyones caller ID

645
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,920
or anything like that there's only a few
people who have access to the

646
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,080
administrator functions at this and
that's like me even getting Sestak

647
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,259
rain keep in mind we don't execute logs
just our luck sorry on the floor

648
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,380
accession so it whenever you connect it
up so you hang up his second

649
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,540
really really the only information that
several orders

650
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,960
who's in the black list file alright and
in reality like if they're in that file

651
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,310
in the feds come to bust us down

652
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,759
I prefer them to get busted issues

653
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,350
%uh they're in there for point

654
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,368
so couple things that we do work on
together is

655
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:28,830
mean Gator on the the usual suspects
radio we do a small

656
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:33,299

657
00:38:33,299 --> 00:38:36,780
we're not big on sports bar other costs
are we talk about technology and

658
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,180

661
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,830
Saturday morning were out on a Champions

the Caliphate 12:30 a.m.

663
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,600
so we work on that project together and
so will I stroll people and talk about

664
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,710
whatever is on your mind

665
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,220
yearns we were bored and just feeling

controls on the radios well now sell and
it goes both ways

668
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,250
the other thing that we work together on
as be even I host the IRC

669
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,850
network for 2600 so load

670
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:23,020
has loads of laughs and fun and but
that's all about community and is making

671
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,490
it work in all this work on that
together

672
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,030

and then the music talkin with you

675
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:40,440

678
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,470

679
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,810
really do only with said we are saddened
iraqi loves giving

680
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,060
or correct just talk about X 25

681
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,750
he's never tell mom and Yahoo to you

682
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:04,680
earlier today I was so I am going to
another excellent tell a freak and

683
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:08,419
J Falcon over here has laptop were
dialing China

684
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,660
II like the helmet

685
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,868
I gotta go very I'm

686
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:21,220
well you exited for tat I

687
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:26,040
yeah but be a broader really are some
peace software called I were which

688
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,880
I'm happy that we're actually posting
hosting that source code on tell a story

689
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,700
yeah and he's chosen to associate with
toll-free it's really all set

690
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,810
I found a great document from %ah the
Department

691
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,109
Homeland Security just recently and it
was an article of from there

692
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:45,190
was its cybersecurity whatever it was so
there

693
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:49,510
was about securing modems and they said
the top 10 the top utilities

694
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:52,650
the first on the mission was I world yes
has

695
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,780
officer if I put that on your resume

696
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,440
hard Tolia if

697
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,250
and it's free Rep secure vote in August
2000

698
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,890
mister as you can tell we're kinda

699
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,109
versatile group of developers I mean I'm
an ass as we talking about

700
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:14,880
under different formulated programs word
me morals have a very short attention

701
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,750
span and so

702
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,390
as you can tell we're all seem to be
working on different prices the same

703
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,109
time that the same you know

704
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:26,339
collaborating on the conference itself
to bring it all together in the end

705
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:29,529
yeah like this entire conference
everything that youre going experience

706
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,290
and the Telford will literally a band

707
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:38,440
made up on the fly like in almost none
of this stuff was pre-planned like

708
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,540
we literally showed up today before and
said what's to certain zones in last

709
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,230
week's

710
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,660
be lonely on the clock the only the only
pre-planning was like

711
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:49,930
okay we're gonna be buying this
equipment I think your plan enough to

712
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,669
crack now I think that we like father

713
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:55,390
like few hundred teachers for something
like that there we have some t-shirts if

714
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,180
you wanna be all telephonic with those

715
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,779
in buyers were we got when I like we're
making money on those were actually on

716
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,850
the whole on those

717
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:05,029
this and the there were some shot
glasses way back when and

718
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:08,330
I think those are going to be a kinda
collectors item for

719
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:13,819
the elite few Telford you're looking for
ideas for a contest into customer gonna

720
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:18,220
for spit on inbound in concert you know
this is entirely based off

721
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:21,920
ideas like its all in this last minute

722
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,430
changes there were going two points for
the most about my contacts made verses

723
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,339
how long the contacts were

724
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,480
that's worth it may be the longest call
and I'll time but like

725
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,500
distance the I think the DTMF things
idea

726
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,760
yes that would be like a a random digits
generated over

727
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,810
you know human here identify them and

728
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,470
yeah right in

729
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:49,470
can read DTMF by here I can for the most
part

730
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:53,030
well contest yeah exactly be ready to
drink when you're done

731
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,920
and how many you know it when he knocked
you never get used to the sound of that

732
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,119
Spurs schools a you can pick up the team

733
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,359
feel realistic or

734
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:11,359
kinda bela Fleck simon says gf

735
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,240
know that stuff be kinda proud nothing
beavers like weird a GI going down right

736
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,619
now but sure we're always wanna share

737
00:43:21,619 --> 00:43:24,790
any other knowledge and experience that
we have and that's what we do you know

738
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,490
just for that stuff you're probably
actually

739
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,770
more likely you'll probably see like the
source code

740
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:34,650
everything that we've done here like any
software that we've written just for

741
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:38,910
the whole project so far anything like
that will probably be posting pretty

742
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:39,580
soon

743
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:44,040
my reason why say that is because just
by the nature the configs a bass tracks

744
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,930
and the way that it said rightly Allah
give me information in there that's

745
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:50,740
confidential oh yeah but the special
know is there such a tax code for 10 my

746
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,849
plan that shit on exactly what I really
said

747
00:43:52,849 --> 00:43:56,810
during the middle of the conference when
everybody's using its

748
00:43:56,810 --> 00:44:03,810
I mean it's probably a good idea to hold
off on that until after

749
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,619
mmm your it always helps to

750
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:14,190
look at a clean extensions file without
any of the original

751
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,569
comment code yup lets you know we'll
talk about it all them and you know it's

752
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:19,930
theirs sorry I like

753
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,490
orbit so what's involved in was your so
we have a vision

754
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,580
our own bridge anyone can call someone
just talk with this so

755
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:31,410
but we a keep this though will in mind

781
00:45:53,549 --> 00:45:57,380
is actually heavily heavily strip down
copy of one that I had been working on

782
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,870
for a while

783
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:02,680
basically you'll see that I'm actually
hiding the actual extension every

784
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,990
telephone number and this display

785
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,900
this is just so that some people have
privacy have called into our system

786
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,560
but I will be publishing the original
source code to this

787
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,589
but it is for administration is what
does it is for administration and

788
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:20,750
basically anybody to build a look
through their law expert yes only

789
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:21,910
administrators

790

you know last few months yeah it's so
you guys are you

807
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,720
ok it's more about the things like this
the Astrix is a great

808
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,609
softer platform but there's a lot of
things are still definitely work in

809
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:33,299
progress

810
00:47:33,299 --> 00:47:36,630
solar like echo some others other
protocols and kodak's

811
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,460
forced the Cisco stuff is not complete
like the skinny

812
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,559
in CGP all that it's not really is

813
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:47,460
it's in secure and its auster sense not
there it's

814
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,990
am you know losses astor's use
constantly changing

815
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,609
to yeah like 24/7 Mike every time you
look around

816
00:47:54,609 --> 00:47:57,630
asterisk has changed but

817
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,339
to and you know it's there you're
signaling us to stop here so we better

818
00:48:01,339 --> 00:48:04,720
finisher I was talking to sleep think
about this earlier but mean

819
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,710
it's not as bad nowadays but I remember
literally

820
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:12,539
having a bug issue with bastard and then

821
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:16,509
you know say wats pull down please you
know subversion

822
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:19,880
you know header s her because sp CVS

823
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:24,019
I and then pulling it down ha Krebs
totally fixed that bug

824
00:48:24,019 --> 00:48:27,799
oh wait now there's two fucking more
bucks you doin you're dealing with that

825
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:28,430
all the time

826
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:32,669
and in high schools even that a
three-game adjustment

827
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:36,660
I like a lot a commercial installations
for Astrix take an hour or people

828
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,660
or Nortel systems replace them with
after it was over P systems

829
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,160
and I've had difficulties with their
code I'm even their early stuff where

830
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:44,489
there's a

831
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:48,480
little bug after work at the gym they're
open source people in their commercial

832
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,309
people to get them to fix stuff

833
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:53,599
because they reminisce offers great but
there's still a lot of flaws

834
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,249
and workout in commercial environments
or beatrice table incompatible

835
00:48:57,249 --> 00:49:03,819
no yeah %uh there there

836
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:08,049
the there are other open source PBX
platforms that are out there like tricks

837
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,089
parks and

838
00:49:09,089 --> 00:49:13,180
as much as baseball sized action yeah
I'm not

839
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,859
really fun any other ones ones I've been
able to use commercially

840
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:20,808
successfully just for around privately
experimentation is asteroids

841
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:23,839
your supports their it's costly change
in the effect

842
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,119
better yeah from from anybody who can
code

843
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,140
from their standpoint it is the most
malleable

844
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,368
operator the most malleable PBXs

845
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,759
I've ever seen personally as a ton of
support for their

846
00:49:37,759 --> 00:49:42,029
oh yeah is us on IRC 2609 and his pound
after some freenode

847
00:49:42,029 --> 00:49:45,589
and things in

848
00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:50,890
such as large as the others are willing
to participate and give support for

849
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:54,150
I mean you can also get commercial
support for aspects as well so

850
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,230
not apply to those guys were actually a
view AP dash in food or call Sonia

851
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,769
has been around for a really long time
my number one resource for

852
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:07,559
any problem asterisks as a lot of
pre-configured samples and

853
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:11,470
worse love div you know providers in
terms that the ID's and

854
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,710
ATA is an equipment

855
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:18,730
outbound trunks all that stuff so it is
this true

856
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,040
all this stuff comes back around to that
is a lot of times things it seems like

857
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,250
to me like fall off

858
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,190
and then you go back to what we just
talked about that earlier something like

859
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,600
also on its back this is weird

860
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:34,740
but yet I hear you're saying it does get
out there it is kinda like units wiki

861
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:35,730
basically so

862
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:39,150

if there's anything you can take for my

892
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,070
self respect you ever join the
conference

893
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,380
is that there's generally some
interesting conversation going on

894
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,310
even if not everybody is talking where
you can usually get a couple

895
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:33,390
really weird people on there talking
about some really interesting stuff

896

arm it well if you tryin to a group or
see a

900
00:52:57,570 --> 00:53:00,590
and to get to dial out or what not

901
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,680
typically what people do and I think
your gtalk in you back me up on this

902
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,750
is you also I wore to disk although the

903
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,320
same phone number and repeatedly tried
hands and then try to dial out and get a

904
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,790
carry on other sites that you have a way
of knowing that the pin was correct or

905
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:15,170
not

906
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,710
based on which unit do in and I were
would be to
