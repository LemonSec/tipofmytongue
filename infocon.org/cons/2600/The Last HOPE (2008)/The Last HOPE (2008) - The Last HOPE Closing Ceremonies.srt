1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,320
here they are

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,950
be meta data team pie

3
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,650
can we get our slide up on the screen

4
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,190
on this is so

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,989
the a funky little badges a

6
00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,629
adult weird idea about the year ago and
%ah

7
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,660
it it exploded and %ah

8
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,360
so these guys are good gonna talk about
love what we've

9
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,380
done and what's actually happened we
head into recession on

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,380
Friday where we talked about the whole

11
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,360
thing in this is basically a summary I
love how we went from

12
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,250
it not working on Friday to it having
lotsa colorful exposing

13
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:30,170
things on screens all over the place now
so Chris

14
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,180
want you store and go through white

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,280
we went through from Friday to now

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,259
with what wasn't working what's working
now okay

17
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,920
sorry I to hear

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,250
we have I

19
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,229
s gonna pull the mike really close we
started on Thursday

20
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,580
and we came to active to hear we have

21
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,150
I just gotta pull the mike really close

22
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,070
we started on Thursday and we came in
with

23
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,780
some other software built a fair amount
of stuff working but once we actually

24
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,740
got the real world system up and working

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,760
up for some things change some things
work something so we started a

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,578
I rewrote some the the core logic which
the triangulation

27
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,860
and also improve the the capacities as
they had a lot more

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,540
one thing we found is that it a
simulator that's pushing out a huge

29
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,100
batches I have

30
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,280
radio events every second doesn't work
the same as if you actually have a

31
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,610
thousand taxes are all

32
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,230
a synchronously sending things at random
times %uh

33
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,760
so once we get a live system up it
turned out we had to do things a little

34
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,540
different so we worked on that

35
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,850
we also had a lot of functionality to
the web system aesthetics

36
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,858
tell you about that I'll and that was
low so are working on for Thursday night

37
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,930
all all Thursday night or Friday morning
and we did manage to get most database

38
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,419
functionality up by Friday morning

39
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,359
than the 3d visualization we got up

40
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:04,500
Saturday morning forget that I think

41
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,030
Saturday night okay but what's today

42
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,290
it's Tuesday already

43
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,150
um so we we we did we're pretty happy
with how things turned out

44
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:20,890
I think we have we had a lot of success
we started with you know great hardware

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,360
platform that was done designed by
milosz down there and headband

46
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,520
used at some the chaos congresses in
camps

47
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,990
I'll but I think we really took the the
software to interact with the attendees

48
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,070
to a new level we added

49
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,170
some social networking features and

50
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,190
a lot more interesting visualization I
think so I was pretty happy with the

51
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,990
product and a

52
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,160
Millis one

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,400
talk about how it's gone

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,400
what you gotta put into it done okay

55
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,000
the so we improve this

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,150
triangulation system so we've had some
ideas we implement

57
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,210
here and it turned out physically

58
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,860
in a very good way so matched previous

59
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,959
tests and what we were basically doing
is

60
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,290
a a adding this nice service as Asian
stuff

61
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,730
basically there were several people
that's

62
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,880
helped us a lot implementing the this
recapitalization

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,340
recently avatars to edit so we

64
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,380
had and a lot of fun less problems than
we expected

65
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,820
we had a lot of interesting import from
people people were

66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,919
a a

67
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,719
showing up and interested writing their
own film for

68
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,389
so we could as a stir them and
frightened film for having

69
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:51,610
differently patterns and stuff like that
so

70
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,250
there were lot of interests the

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,990
shown and we had people for example

72
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,290
road of medications for with those Asian
deepthroats a small scripts to

73
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,810
the being able to see where their
friends

74
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,840
are currently so people actually using
know if your eyes and

75
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,970
we are very glad about this that we the

76
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:17,520
created this nice a a set of publication
that people actually using

77
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,690
so thanks to you guys used our staff and
we got a lot of the

78
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,370
good response from you so we are
basically very happy

79
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,280
about the stuff with it and thanks for
great support and

80
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,890
but you're in the south because we had a
lot of trouble on

81
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,690
giving didn't get any sleep at all and
thanks 30

82
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,690
positive input here

83
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,370
10

84
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:56,130
service before the

85
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,370
this is actually something we added up
pretty late today

86
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,620
this is this is based on a

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,750
user-contributed visualization system
that you can actually go and click

88
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,480
on an idea at all so you information
about them so we went

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:18,480
and enhance that a lil for also aircraft
K

90
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,180
so we had a few custom avatars 10 you'll
see is a little

91
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,150
northbound August get there and that's
actually dog which is

92
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,260
terribly which is currently currently
wearing a Sputnik idea better there

93
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,690
this

94
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,580
previously recorded the right now
there's people

95
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,880
yeah yeah every reasons its

96
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,880
I don't think we have the visualization
software installed on the system

97
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:16,690
like it

98
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:38,460
so this is a 3d visualization the one we
got working last night

99
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,510
I it's based on one that was built for
I'll

100
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,870
what a journey congress' and this is
also trying a second floor

101
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:51,310
know this is this is also previously
Zara

102
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:58,300
video clips the reason we're trying a
lot of stuff in the second floor is

103
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,770
in order to get good triangulation
locations you have to have a fair number

104
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:05,330
readers install on this floor was a
little more difficult running the cable

105
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,210
so we didn't get as many readers and
solve

106
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:11,160
we wanted to on the second floor there's
there's truss overhead and pipes we

107
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,030
really just throw internet cables

108
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:20,030
on this floor is a lot more difficult

109
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:28,610
and you want to talk about stuff that

110
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:35,019
Senate is so

111
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,269
my hope to talk reminders work waco
we're having some issues with the mail

112
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,799
them in

113
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,409
at some point and we got that work and
so the things work in

114
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:49,029
what's going on there is there's a ton
of stuff here

115
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,389
you can cite the provider and issues

116
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:56,699
Miller SMS and in theory X number
minutes before the talk will send you a

117
00:08:56,699 --> 00:08:58,899
reminder letting you know that the talk
you want to see

118
00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:02,889
is a up we also have our

119
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:07,899
your for where you're from what your
hometown by zip code and restore asking

120
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,040
for ZIP code in countries because we
plan on

121
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,599
visualizing that on the Google Maps or
something anything cross-reference that

122
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,769
with other interests play

123
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:17,810
for summers and eight people in Alabama
like to talk for free

124
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,449
and you can find out who they are and
can use that to a too much cool stuff

125
00:09:21,449 --> 00:09:25,378
so you can subscribe to talks

126
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:28,589
unsubscribe overdose

127
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:34,459
is a ton of stuff in there you guys have
been doing some data mining what have

128
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:35,319
you got another

129
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:39,000
CPF are sticks open crunching on

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,339
so for the most part

131
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,100
are from also work on visualizing just
base

132
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:52,059
actor statistics which you can see if
you stats stuff PHP

133
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:58,009
are these a sax 60 what talks people
liked the most

134
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:02,209
are where people spent the most time in
terms of

135
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,889
activities they did arm in the future

136
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:09,350
at and warm welcome to do this because

137
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,290
we are going to be giving duplication do
said our conditioning

138
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,189
on various statistics so do you make
wary

139
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:21,379
more specific on a data like

140
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:24,620
what are the interest the people that
come from Alabama

141
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,740
back months is con today we can also do
this by time

142
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,480
to so see think there's the left column
for a lot of these is

143
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,880
for our and the wreck on the actor is
just the total for the entire concert

144
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,029
can actually do an hour by hour
comparison

145
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:45,910
and watch the interests like as people
come and people register

146
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,469
we can actually do dynamic graphs and
watch the data changes the congos

147
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:57,470
like it's really cool

148
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,870
so

149
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,160
a lot more interesting than myself is
just when people interact with each

150
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,660
other

151
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,300
like the pain yeah talk about things

152
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,970
other things that people aren't aware
what they are

153
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,300
I was trying to construct something on a
social networking web sites like

154
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,860
I'll text you if it is an easy one we
can send the router somebody

155
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,780
like oh she is hot on the center and see
if she's interested I was trying to

156
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,189
imitate something like that but

157
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,090
on goers talk to each other if you click
on that you like on it will send your

158
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,080
email address

159
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,240
an email to whoever it is and likewise

160
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,390
you can send them a text message with
your tech with your cell phone number

161
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,550
and it's just a way to help people
connect ago whether the statistics for

162
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,420
looking out right here

163
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,089
those are the most popular zones

164
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,690
as a the lot as a the last hour and in
general

165
00:11:56,690 --> 00:12:00,770
as you can see people like people like
being

166
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,280
in this very room a lot yeah so we can
actually rate the talks by

167
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,839
it's not even just filling out I thought
the stock was cool weekend

168
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,120
gauge how many people were actually
attending each talk live and we can

169
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,980
actually cross reference that with if
you subscribe to talk to you didn't show

170
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,390
up

171
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,640
you can see if you actually showed up
talk says opposed to who subscribe to

172
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,210
talks

173
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,220
right yet

174
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,590
the statistics for talk show actually
list how many people

175
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,260
actually attended in this useful these
are the actual tends to have gone to you

176
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,200
see these talks

177
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,510
so really this has been a beta test

178
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,840
love OVA beta tester were out repeating
what was done the CCC

179
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,160
a couple times and we've got a lot of
things

180
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,540
a functional that they couldn't get
functional and they got things

181
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,199
functional they couldn't get before

182
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,550
and this is a stepping stone making the
system better and better

183
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,450
die if we do this another conference
will have more features

184
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,760
more features just get cooler and cooler
with do with

185
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,270
we can also we can even click on a talk

186
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,670
and pull up a list of all the people who
were in it so it's not just a number

187
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,840
like feature speaker 242 can actually
pull off a life list

188
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,990
every person who was in that room and
then we can actually do interests like

189
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,430
all these people from Alabama like
tellows talk so could do a lot a

190
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,570
cross-reference invest on that do we
have any questions

191
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,710
the

192
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,890
the website is plugged in downstairs
tick the box on wheels

193
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,120
it will it will go down but we're going
to try to keep it up

194
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,140
at some point will try to put that
information

195
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,500
Dhaka we're not sure yet but you can
check up to that

196
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,840
in the future there there are few things
that are gonna go up

197
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:49,530
we've already started posting some the
log data that's just tag ID so there's

198
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,390
there's no

199
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:54,010
no private information OPI I involved in
that um

200
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,730
so we'll be posting that will also be
opposing source code

201
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,540
and possibly you know movies of the
entire conference sped up

202
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,910
as the as time goes on we have time to
at things will be putting up in that

203
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,439
there will be on hand to help

204
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,680
outside any other questions

205
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,730
you reset your password to the
information does provide they're still

206
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,120
open

207
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:22,370
%uh was I think Mitch cancer

208
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,380
that question see

209
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,950
him schism my voice is totally gone but
Tom

210
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:34,330
mmm we cost twelve thousand dollars to
make 3500

211
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:40,650
love these ford's 1400 up those 3500
have the parts for

212
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,459
tracking on them that's all we could
afford we we wanted thirty five hundred

213
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,640
and we got the maximum we can afford for
twelve thousand dollars at work

214
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:53,180
with the parts so for they did a pretty
good job

215
00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:00,180
when they manufacture them

216
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:10,470
a bit yes

217
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,350
his

218
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,600
yeah if there are Michael Symon's

219
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,660
like newborn has questions to

220
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:31,040
to just to clarify a little bit about
the baby you're gonna retained for a

221
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,020
period of time

222
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,199
are you gonna try to but it all up on
your website

223
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,390
on the new passwords and telephone
numbers

224
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,760
and I think user names will not be rice
kind of dresses all around address all

225
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,240
non-personal information

226
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,240
alright came on cross-examination right
be released at some point I am did

227
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,920
addicted we get the the steps appear
their

228
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,190
still on their way okay we

229
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:09,360
are gonna give up some prizes for up
certain activities that we were tracking

230
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,390
that there were games going on and %ah

231
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,390
we're winning on those numbers to come
up because they were left on a laptop

232
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,160
downstairs

233
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,949
I'm we will actually not only release a
a final doc files

234
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,820
we will people many responded look twice
a week and write your own desires asian

235
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,450
software

236
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,820
so if you started your own projects
focus was on is a lot visualizing the

237
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,420
data

238
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,720
there will be a sauce court

239
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,020
available where you can generates the

240
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,370
damn what a tough based on the existing
conference of the basic cable

241
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,810
replay the whole conference and you can
test applications with this is the first

242
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,750
single released

243
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,830
it basically contact contains the whole

244
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,880
raw data so you have your tech ID

245
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,160
you have sequence numbers you have the
sickness frank's

246
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,720
the which the data was received a

247
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,480
if at the flexed for the bottom so for
example if you decided to use your

248
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,150
bottom has a

249
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,500
marker the you can later assigned the
state ought to have surrender from the

250
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,839
conference or whatever so

251
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,730
basic get all the detail you need we
additionally

252
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,790
release preprocessed text data

253
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,819
what's a so don't have to worry about

254
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,250
this binary file formats a.m. the state
have also contain

255
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,880
a rough estimation of your position so
you don't have to deal with this if you

256
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,740
don't want

257
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,230
at two and you can use this data is that
the two

258
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:44,980
your script languages to force process
that the time for example to

259
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,940
find our relationships between groups
for example to find out if certain

260
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,410
tax Appiah a relatively often at the
same

261
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,290
a place so this continues to residents
yes social

262
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,340
contacts so we r they're curious what

263
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:04,449
will come up with we together it's a
mound of data

264
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,070
the or already the binary la causa
something like sixty

265
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,189
bites of data so

266
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,150
as we want you to have as much fun

267
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,550
going to Staters we have considering its

268
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:26,710
yours

269
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,059
and have what we will a we will release
the state are under

270
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:35,149
a Creative Commons license with explicit

271
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:39,769
statement that was don't want to have is
used for commercial purposes so

272
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:43,009
I think this is the least amount you can
do to protect your data so

273
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:46,769
professional data mining as:

274
00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:50,149
me hopefully the possibly its said

275
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:53,940
at the scene license term so people.com
resell your data

276
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,269
so I think this is a fair deal in my
opinion so

277
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:01,240
a a yeah and if you have any questions
feel free to ask

278
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,330
doesn't look that you have to be a very
curious but will come up

279
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,389
I have fun they invite yeah if

280
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,639
innes I am that my IP I

281
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:14,269
in number and never got the second page

282
00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:18,190
system accepted it but I could never
accessed system again but that they

283
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,750
never got

284
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,070
a sec a I'll stacks

285
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,189
debugging the website has been
developing the web so we've run a couple

286
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,299
things like that I mean it's a
development system we've never played it

287
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,090
before so we've run into some periodic
issues like the

288
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,080
what was the end the initial for that we
had with Logan's with

289
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,408
website right oh yeah it

290
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:43,720
so this is a feature that this is fun
this is fun

291
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,940
so a couple years ago I think it was a
black hat Jeremiah Grossman a sanction

292
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,529
released

293
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,649
this interesting %uh CSS hack where

294
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,279
basically the way with which a clear the
way it works

295
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,149
is on when you look at a web page and
you have a list of links if you've

296
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:02,370
clicked on the link it will show up in a
different color

297
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,639
done it like that you haven't slept on
it and you can actually use a tool that

298
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,149
can not determine whether you visited
that or not

299
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:14,000
so we initially had a script that would
hammer about 250 web addresses

300
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,960
at you when you were logging in to try
to get an idea of what kind of web sites

301
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,009
before president and that's what was
causing the initial login issue

302
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:24,700
I had to disable that early on it would
have been really cool with it works but

303
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,139
it was

304
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,879
causing problems suck fuck you have a
question yeah I kinda

305
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:32,149
got my question answered as they say
what games they played yet so

306
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,700
question is that what were these games
because when I love in this

307
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,799
let's be very sick is less than a lot
there's a couple hours ago

308
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:45,799
my game HD networks I have no idea what
this game's the existing we originally

309
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,279
were supposed to have bowlers Spurs have
two games

310
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,980
time schedule forced us to down to

311
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,000
ones for game based on stats the stats
game is basically

312
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,870
rewards for activities completed based
on

313
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,820
where you were in the conference like
me. talks you were at coming workshops

314
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,510
you're at so that's going to be

315
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,139
couple minutes other game was going to
be a scavenger hunt

316
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:13,580
but location tracking to

317
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,129
maintain people gathering things based
on their

318
00:21:17,129 --> 00:21:20,250
location in proximity to other things

319
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:25,820
proved to be a lot of complex program
doing the time had we

320
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,928
basically took a system that track we're
two hundred people were

321
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,789
and turned it into something that could
track 1400 people

322
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:37,820
in under four months which is

323
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:44,820
at and do our of work Chris Chris Petro

324
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:49,600
and rage fury who is very shy and hiding
in the corner

325
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,330
%uh did and the men's another coding to
get this thing going and so the echo in

326
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,580
Tupelo and statics and to pay for an all
these guys

327
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:04,580
really put into a tremendous amount of
effort to get

328
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,910
question up quickly in light of the
large financial investment that was made

329
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:15,320
in the hardware and the fact that the
tax every program do you recommend that

330
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,480
people retain them

331
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,350
for possible application in the future
not just as a souvenir

332
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,370
some you must wear itself please bring
your texts over

333
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,440
at the next conference oh in case we do
the striking we can reprogram it so it's

334
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,160
not a big deal from our side so

335
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,850
the will probably there will be another
tracking

336
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,390
were made another bits but you can't be
said reprogram it

337
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,970
and

338
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:42,850
so bring your text next time and a

339
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:46,240
we will reprogram it for free i'm
probably yeah thank you

340
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,090
much fun the

341
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,300
point out that may be a really
interesting statistic would be

342
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,480
the percent difference people were there
star

343
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,480
talk persons who were there at the end
of the dock yeah

344
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,740
I was actually wondering

345
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,020
so the tags are a few dollars each
together but

346
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,120
how much for the receivers I'm like how
much pasta the

347
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,360
infrastructure I am gets hard to tell
because it's not so

348
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,429
openly available on the market yet but
what we have if you want to play around

349
00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:23,100
with this

350
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,470
we also have me the low-cost reader base
and USB

351
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,169
it's called open beak and USB it
contains nom process also can just plug

352
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:32,460
it into your laptop and

353
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,140
to you can run busy the same a
algorithms

354
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,390
on this so if you have for example say
it University just like getting random

355
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,159
computers and you can set up for

356
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,520
assess the the spec consistent easily
and string I think it sold for something

357
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:46,809
like

358
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:51,379
eighty five dollars or so X so I think
that's the cheapest possibility

359
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,100
have all come up with a new reader
decide which will be also

360
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,159
open source for our process of a.m.

361
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,210
was the release the something into a
three to four months

362
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:05,730
if the containers Kat micro SD card slot
so can store data locally

363
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,799
and to all sauces made available again

364
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,700
the existing every does is here a is
based on our

365
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:18,070
custom designed with its and it's a it's
a highly proprietary microcontroller to

366
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,770
become

367
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,520
20 20 to if someone you know said it
contains an inveterate

368
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,740
10 coming up with the Senate interface
but the

369
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,140
SDK for it is tremendously expensive
something like seven thousand dollars so

370
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,200
is no point of releasing it into the
public

371
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,220
therefore we up country greenery
implementing and you he said that based

372
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,770
reader

373
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,158
based on or because basically

374
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,370
you have this very nice very arduous
operating system running their

375
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:49,470
so even for programs are not experienced
in

376
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:52,659
embedded programming at all it's very
easy to

377
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,760
create tossed there it's very efficient

378
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,020
the remaining court for been very low
you have for

379
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,710
at the park the term over US so it's
very easy for

380
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,350
Everts

381
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:10,210
common like programmers to extend it and
to have a 46-yard P stay

382
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,720
the web server so basically its

383
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,690
is I think are suggested platform for
isn't based tracking solutions and

384
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:23,440
future so please be patient and you will
have a nice open source solution in some

385
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,080
months check back to open the kind of
exciting

386
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:34,080
if you up to date

387
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,139
officer we have some statistics appear
on weird looking for ID number

388
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,509
404 eight so if you look at your badge

389
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:47,740
and it's also the handle blackfish and
%ah

390
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,279
mars man 8790 if you wanna come up

391
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,029
%uh you were the top 10 hangers with a
counter 7

392
00:25:55,029 --> 00:25:59,850
I that the top two

393
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,159
and yet yeah have a time surface cuz so

394
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,320
for ladies or gentlemen wanna come up
%uh

395
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,240
Chris what will you explain the steps we
got there okay

396
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,360
we have a few stats we were able to mine
real quickly I

397
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,110
definitely like the idea the scene who
stays for an entire talk must

398
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,860
I'll I had tote up here I'd probably try
crank that out more on stage but I don't

399
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,970
um what we do have is

400
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,000
some information about the hooping
people the most who was paying the most

401
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,750
who went to the most talks and who was
actually on the RFID network the longest

402
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,159
so when you got your room

403
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,850
you go off the network when you leave to
go out to lunch or whatever you go of a

404
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:40,309
network

405
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,639
but there are some people who are
actually in either on this floor on the

406
00:26:43,639 --> 00:26:45,009
second floor for an extraordinary

407
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:48,649
time this weekend so we've got some
prizes for them to

408
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,789
okay a this is up like fish and he's won
a TV be gone

409
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:59,600
%ah

410
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,509
is on mars man 8790 here yes

411
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,690
okay he won a t-shirt or a TV

412
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:12,929
art okay

413
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,340
%ah

414
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,559
some numbers your top 10 P e's

415
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:20,629
and there was not time for that one so
number one is bicycle mark

416
00:27:20,629 --> 00:27:24,070
bicycle market the lotto

417
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:27,950
0 people love to okay children's from
the

418
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,019
team do we go to the next winner with
try to find them yeah as

419
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,080
yeah exhorts here Chuck Norris

420
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,189
II

421
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,629
as number three 111

okay up

426
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,700
so the top 10 talk attendee

427
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:04,850
it enters are number one was arch

428
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,889
rhythm scrawled arch Griffin

429
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:17,889
a number 4051 are you here alright

430
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,269
and %ah top 10 spent in range

431
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:30,480
tech darco was here for so also

432
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,549
also we have one other person they're
actually want the 25 Costco

433
00:28:33,549 --> 00:28:36,658
I he's been on the radio for the entire
weekend

434
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:43,659
a a

435
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,460
ok up I think

436
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,110
does a bail to everything else2 cover

437
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:00,149
it's at the bottom

438
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:03,570
okay know we can stop yeah

439
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,439
a bunch of guys from the the river per
actually in the top cuz they

440
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,700
never left I

441
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,310
up

442
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,770
you come up yeah to

443
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:23,770
ok it thank you network we don't know
for certain that the

444
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,600
hotel will be torn down when I was
possibility we don't know for certain

445
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,640
we might not meet again at this place
Los possibility

446
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,720
lot of things are possible

447
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:54,590
will make something happen we're just
waiting for a manual we're gonna have a

448
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,090
%ah

449
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,490
closing ceremony love

450
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:05,490
deep sorrow absolutely solemn

451
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:13,140
we're also going to invite the arm some
other people not necessarily every

452
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,660
single person but some %uh the

453
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,720
or we sometimes called the core group
group of people that

454
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,140
were section leaders the people at have
been working on this for

455
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,480
up to a year certainly quite a few
months love emails or a

456
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,460
cell phone calls little IRC

457
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,130
face to face meetings whatever it took

458
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,240
let's have the

459
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,270
the core staff everyone knows who they
are think come up on stage

460
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:50,270
manuals on his way and I think as we
speak

461
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:12,770
I know is on the way

462
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,860
like to remind us at this time to be
appropriately respectful

463
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:27,860
somber mood serious occasion

464
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:33,770

on

510
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,280
0

511
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,970
ask the blood of hope

512
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:13,550
well okay here we are

513
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,250
and per session again we are gathered
here to

514
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,480
I remember hope and let us remember hope
as

515
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,870
it occurred back and 1994

516
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,130
how many if you were here for this well
not there

517
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,620
that was the first help hackers on
planet Earth in this very same hotel

518
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:41,370
the hotel Pennsylvania in 1997 we moved
to a different location

519
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:45,279
he's gonna kill me

520
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,020
it look like that anymore but the

521
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,780
but that's how I picture we could find
with the bumper sticker and that we took

522
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,870
place in the park building downtown as
the only conference that we didn't have

523
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:56,810
in this building

524
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,960
I was in nineteen 97

525
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,530
and then in 2000 week came right back to
the hotel Pennsylvania for h2k how many

526
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,320
view here for that

527
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,480
how quite a few quite a few

528
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,820
keep coming back two years later

529
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,120
with the name nobody expected h2k

530
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,020
to

531
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,250
and all kinds of interesting little
cards

532
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:25,230
that we had it out as admission that is
and of course

533
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:29,839
people tried to call the next one h2k
for for some reason but no it was the

534
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:30,170
fifth

535
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:34,440
hope and that kind of confused everybody
come in if you're here for that one

536
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,640
or more people most most I'd say the
sixty percent people

537
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,950
and then two years ago

538
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,800
hope number six I haven't asked a
question yet

539
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,819
okay how many of you were here for that
one

540
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:54,810
as well very nice an hour course

541
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,250
the last help and you know i i guess
maybe

542
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:02,059
Co

543
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:06,550
okay I should have expected that

544
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,060
arm I guess this is my fault because
there might have been a little bit about

545
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,190
confusion

546
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:15,910
about the whole lot our last hope thing
I mean

547
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:19,140
you know the the whole carrying the
casket surrounded

548
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,529
the flowers in the candles in the deaths

549
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,770
you now talk and according to think it's
a it's just can't dark

550
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:29,980
image you now satanic metal music

551
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:33,770
honest I don't know it just can't seem
kinda called the time but mostly

552
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,200
mostly the confusion seems to I

553
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,170
be about definitions of words on

554
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,530
and an I think maybe what people were
asking me the most

555
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,300
a not only this weekend but in the
months are preceding this conference

556
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,370
why is it the last hole

557
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:56,220
people across the come to me and ask me
that question all I could say that the

558
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:56,580
muscle

559
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,690
its it's because thats but what is its

560
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,890
the last opening you know why is
anything anything

561
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,779
things happen for a reason and we all
know the definitions of words

562
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,250
last have course meaning final that it
no more

563
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,840
done for nato yeah

564
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,600
and while I mean you know there's is
good and there's bad to definitions of

565
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,310
words

566
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:22,660
alright I for instance this is one thing
you can say the suspect last year we'll

567
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,009
have this man is our president

568
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:31,010
the

569
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,970
I am NOT injecting politics into hacking
what I'm doing is simply using the word

570
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:37,810
in a sentence

571
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:41,320
%uh and that's a fact

572
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:46,910
now here's where I must take a little
bit of our responsibility for perhaps

573
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,069
not being entirely clear there is a
different meaning to the word last

574
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,080
the most recent previous

575
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,020
the one that just happened for instance
the question being

576
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:01,360
did you attend the last hope conference

577
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:05,130
yes

578
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,220
and I intend to are

579
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:15,220
be at the next ok conference the

580
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:45,349
the

581
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,869
but we should have the last couple on
time ago I thought

582
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:54,359
kinda response but yeah you know they're
not gonna tear this place down

583
00:42:54,359 --> 00:42:58,299
no way I mean this place is just too
means too much to to many people

584
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:01,700
and I've heard from a lot of people who
work here that there

585
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,269
the plans because it because the failing
economy believe it or not the plan to

586
00:43:05,269 --> 00:43:07,329
tear this place down have been shelved

587
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:12,620
for the indefinite future why

588
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,580
now

589
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,310
so whatever you can do hurt the economy
I suppose will help this place

590
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,810
whatever you feel like doing but the

591
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,070
I mean a lot of you guys are a pirate
special enough is in the audience I

592
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,200
really took it upon themselves to get
the word out about the hotel how

593
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,410
important it is to save it

594
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,089
I think it made a difference i I don't
never admitted for not other people on

595
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,790
the place will never admit it I think
it'd

596
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,630
and I i think a lot of people realize
that yeah this is a weird place a weird

597
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:44,080
hotel what a strange

598
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,470
rooms and floors and and stories I'll

599
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:50,480
by it's our place and its it's very
unique

600
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,170
and the people that run it have been
very good to us and I think we've all

601
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,140
had a great weekend

602
00:43:54,140 --> 00:44:01,140
my right

603
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,550
and I really have to thank you guys more
than anybody because

604
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:14,130
you establish the tone of the whole
weekend just by

605
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:17,770
being so call hangin out and are
learning so much coming to the talks

606
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:21,620
are being partly in the project which
people worked so tirelessly on to make

607
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,650
that work I love it up

608
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:27,720
radius that letter which I thought was a
incredible idea I so many things happen

609
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,230
at this conference I think we had more
projects than ever

610
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:33,810
and we had a a bigger turnout than ever
and that's one of the reasons why

611
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,660
hell we'd be crazy not to do this again
so yeah we're gonna be here on

612
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:41,009
but you know I don't wanna be the only
person thanking people because I'm gonna

613
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:42,400
forget so many so

614
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,540
you know just introduced to the people
down there

615
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,480
is only a few the people that have been
working tirelessly for for weeks months

616
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:49,870
even

617
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:53,180
actually I guess I really should
introduce Mike first because he's the

618
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:53,680
guy

619
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,919
responsible for bringing club Monte to
the United States

620
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,920
the

621
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,700
my could you possibly just tell us a
little bit what you had to go through to

622
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,390
get

623
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,799
five pallets other stuff over here get
these people addicted

624
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,600
on us about 100 emails back and forth a
and the the people who sell it don't

625
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,510
speak English and

626
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:21,890
I speak almost no German so it was a

627
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,509
something that sounds but we had a lot
of help we had a a lawn and Switzerland

628
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:25,880
who

629
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,859
can make a cousin to start new job but
for whatever reason was really dedicated

630
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:32,290
to this project and kept translating for
us

631
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,680
and I'll then who is maybe even right up
here but certainly in the room

632
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,390
up told us how to import food he's a
food safety expert

633
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,779
hackers are food safety experts to I am

634
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,670
so the a lot of people help with this
project and a a lot of people seem to

635
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:57,670
like the results so I i'm happy if you
did I should say that if you are a %uh

636
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:05,000
wanna buy a lot of it if

637
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,140
will probably consider importing more so
I

638
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:13,339
go to club hyphen mater .us and click on
the contact link and the

639
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:17,530
get in touch if you wanna buy some it
turns out the magazine businesses into

640
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,869
all that problem but that this is
something that really could to

641
00:46:20,869 --> 00:46:25,450
become diners at so we're gonna give
that a shot a first 24 years alright I

642
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,930
was good but now it's about

643
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:32,040
addicting caffeine beverages we have
term effect I think for

644
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,060
hear from from the sea I i think it was

645
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,340
scenic in Berlin I the spying

646
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,030
bottles at the stuff by the arm fallen
with this manic look on his face

647
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:46,180
the told me you know there's something
here there's a market to be exploited

648
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,470
I want to thank you Nick for for putting
an idea in my head and

649
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,150

652
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:02,310

know I ran a project called

653
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:07,109
hackers on a plane which two people from
last year's def con to the CCC camp

654
00:47:07,109 --> 00:47:11,450
and um unfortunately some other people
that I brought over to work for me

655
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,960

that I had to stay up for

658
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:26,630
for five days at a time and I don't
think I could have done it without

659
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:30,990
mater as soon as I get my palate home

758
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:32,790
that's

759
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:38,619
I'm from

760
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:41,920
a piece of the world you maybe never go

761
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,390
but you know we have like a really
interesting history love fascism and hit

762
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:46,440
little stuff that's

763
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,980
kinda cool %uh and its a

764
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,349
we speak a strange language called
German

765
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:57,299
okay actually it's that standard variety
of Austrian actor

766
00:54:57,299 --> 00:55:00,349
other differences like a German German
would see isometric

767
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:04,130
and also in German sees share this: as
it's like

768
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,710
okay up okay I come from a country

769
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:11,740
with a language called Austrian German
and we have a really cool

770
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,190
term for this thing how do you call here

771
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,819
it's that simple in German we call it

772
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:22,890
klom of the clinching monkey a

773
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:26,960
and I would like to try

774
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,880
as linguistic experiment an experiment
in epistemology now

775
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:34,099
okay so there are so many cool people
out there most if you are

776
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:38,030
opinion leaders so a I'd like to use it

792
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:35,770

793
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:36,770
be something like

794
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:40,980
hacker theme song yeah something we
can't feel good about

795
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,040
K so I was scanning my archives

796
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,339
and I found an interesting song from
1996

797
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:51,740
it's a German song I have to translation
in English on screen right now

798
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:55,780
up the song is called sell some
multimedia

799
00:56:55,780 --> 00:57:00,339
okay a back ross story about that one

if you hear it

804
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,130

805
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:24,369
ahead of its time like a pretty white

1002
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:17,380
I I think

1003
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,670
it was an incredible incredible
experience especially when I think image

1004
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,940
again for running such a great
microcontroller workshop

1005
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:26,420
that was busy 24 /7 we just give another
round of applause real quickly

1006
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:33,420
I

1007
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,190
a lot of people are coming up to me
today saying oh wow this is such a great

1008
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:37,820
thing is

1009
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:41,519
is such a great success but ultimately
whether or not the a hackerspace village

1010
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,160
is a success or failure will depend on
whether or not you go out

1011
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,870
and build hackerspace is where you live
check out hackerspace start work in

1012
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:55,870
thank you very much for letting you run
this year thank you have

1013
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:01,960
that deserve so much credit for for
spreading the news about hackers bases

1014
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,230
throughout this country

1015
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:07,000
and for I'm visiting place all
throughout the world learning how they

1016
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,200
run hackerspace is

1017
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,550
such a real movement is something that's
at spreading all over the place and

1018
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:14,760
in another couple years like I can only
imagine what's gonna be like this it's

1019
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,380
really

1020
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,670
I've never felt this optimistic about
the whole concept of

1021
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:22,250
a packer space is not since the days
aloft I guess okay

1022
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:26,480
how r bernie has been involved in a many
things in the conference

1023
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,230
but there's one thing in particular that
I'd like to have him talk about which i

1024
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:30,880
think is

1025
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,610
may be one of the most important things
that the we could have done and I'm very

1026
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:35,799
happy that it worked

1027
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,450
and for anyone to tell the story many
many here

1028
01:11:39,450 --> 01:11:43,360
probably heard of their ratio of the
Hooksett for a long time bredren

1029
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,429
I Jim potentials in is jeopardy Jim

1030
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:50,030

1031
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:54,530
may have a survey know that Tia stricken
by stroke last year very serious stroke

1032
01:11:54,530 --> 01:11:57,800

recovery over the past few months but

1033
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,220
this

1034
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,910
weekend has been his first public
appearance and

1035
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:05,580
a lot of people like a lot of effort to
bring gym here check can you stand up

1036
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:12,580
for second setup the

1037
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,330
the biggest jump in for a second a lot
of people wanted to

1038
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:31,410
have gym come to the conference and and
take part in it

1039
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,849
but we're all so busy organizing the
conference bernie is the one who took

1040
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,390
the time to make it happen and how we
did it but

1041
01:12:37,390 --> 01:12:41,260
made dozens of phone calls and and
somehow made it on

1042
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:45,460
a priority to to get him over here to
have him stay at the hotel said he would

1043
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:45,910
not miss

1044
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:48,809
anything from conference because he did
not want to miss a moment at the

1045
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:49,530
conference

1046

1256
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:12,739
the other guys make this possible the
people that help us a strike at the end

1257

amazing people don't believe it's

1260
01:26:20,769 --> 01:26:24,039
possible the something like this and and

in with this from the start since the
early eighties

1268
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,280
up probably could have gone on to a life
success

1269
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:59,349
you there in not corporate America maybe
in the circus

1270

1271
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:07,370

name Immanuel I think we know something
history something in the commitment

1273
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:11,750
something up

1274
01:27:11,750 --> 01:27:15,570
the level of effort that it takes I
think we've seen

1275
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:18,820
I in a number of ways that he's not in
it for the money not

1276
01:27:18,820 --> 01:27:22,210
for the fame and that his visionary

to recognize much tell the people that

1282
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:01,900
can pull something off

1283
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,640
despite people saying it's impossible
and I'm I hope I don't lose that ability

1284
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,030
and times and because
