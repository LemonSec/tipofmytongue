1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,400
two huge round of applause please
they're awesome the

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,720
date they produce epic epic awesome um

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,020
now probably shouldn't say too much but
heck the season so it might be a

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:11,910
conflict of interest

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,740
and in this country now only a year

6
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,180
after on this talk was first given we
had twelve different cities in the

7
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,029
united states that are all actively
developing hackers his projects

8
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:26,090
had the packard had to run on dot

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,630
with what was Toronto's hackerspace act
.co

10
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,649
and pack lot .to I we had Kansas City

11
00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,690
texarkana a lot of hacker spaces are in
progress

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,608
as a direct result %uh the first version
of the stock so without any further ado

13
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,649
I present to you then so work with
hackerspace design patterns given the

14
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:44,479
huge

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:51,479
can't run class kept

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,920
it's a really an honor to be here for me
and

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,559
I really feel like it does this coming
to full circle like

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,449
this this whole thing started 1 year ago
and now

19
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,259
Island updated version of the talk that
we prepare its

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,430
like 1 year ago a.m.

21
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,530
is here the last hope so

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,760
um what I'm going to talk about is

23
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,890
hecka space design patents and to cuddle
ok that we

24
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,850
compiled for that I will explain why we
call it design patterns

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,160
arm but first I will just introduce
myself and increases people behind this

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,500
presentation and then

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,230
yeah the largest part of the
presentation is actually the catalog

28
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,200
that I will present so

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,470
on this just one person on state right
now but they aren't many people behind

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,220
us talk

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,310
arm unfortunately lost via appeared on

32
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,020
of CCC cologne could make it we were
suppose to talk together but

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,080
so um at the last minute he receive

34
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,539
the very I typical hecka

35
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,380
electricity posole his stick it to a
hope

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,429
went away with that I

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,330
test the Haas also CCC cologne
contributed many patterns

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,929
I A also exchange ideas with the
temperate level CCC Berlin

39
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,629
heartburn yet

40
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:18,298
problem of metal ap Indiana unfortunate
could make it

41
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:21,340
a but he also had some contributions to
the south

42
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,670
talk and many many people from a sissy
provided feedback

43
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,200
and of course the American hecka seen we
free pat this talk

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,769
to present our experience of 10 of 15
years supporting actor spaces and

45
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:37,859
putting it in in in one piece um

46
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:41,810
yeah E just because of that visit of
American hackers

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,840
so you also to thank for

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,209
arm my name is Jens fallish arm

49
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,349
I know it's a weird name it so yep of
germany was enough

50
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:55,659
Johanna so would be John meaningless but

51
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:59,048
because it looks like a goth name like
10 a

52
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:03,709
people get me free stuff online when the
I um

53
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,109
I'm one of the cofounders of their case
Computer Club in Cologne in Germany

54
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:14,040
I am still active there I've been an
activist for the CCC

55
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,620
in general and in Germany for more than
15 years now

56
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,579
and I a at one point I was the
spokesperson for the CCC talk to the

57
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,439
press talk to other organizations for a
mother was a member on the part of the

58
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,150
city

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,909
but the yeah for personal reasons I
stopped student thats but

60
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,888
I still follow the organization very
closely I'm involved with the

61
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,019
annual case Communication Congress that
takes place

62
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:44,260
every year between Christmas and New New
Year arm

63
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,918
the CCC in Cologne was founded in 1997

64
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,090
and we have around 42 members um

65
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,480
we we don't actually know but we think
that 42 is a good number

66
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,209
it's a good random number up but around
yeah

67
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,290
50% less than 50 people um and there are
also people

68
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,400
who technically our members but don't
show up anymore

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,579
and we are currently in our 30 points
fists

70
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,459
version of a hackerspace a first lesson
was

71
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,590
and a ball that's so

72
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,430
we got hold of but we later found out
why

73
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,450
week were able to get a lease for that
part because the

74
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,400
the the person who ran that by law was a

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,400
away on the state-sponsored holiday

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,630
a mmm and actually the we had lots of
people turning up

77
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,310
at our place asking where the new place
to buy the COPE was

78
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,490
and iron yet week we moved out of that
place

79
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,620
um and and found found another place
which was just a small and then

80
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,210
we at a new place but we only use half
the of the space and the other half

81
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,710
was going to someone who actually lived
there and when that person

82
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,450
a moved outs we our group was a strong
enough to to just take over the whole

83
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,159
space

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,040
so that's a.m. well we are now in all
the pictures in this presentation were

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,080
taking

86
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,140
at the sea for like a space that this
thesis economic aspects which we

87
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,080
abbreviate c4 like that plastic
explosives

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,550
um

89
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,590
so why did we compile its catalogue: um

90
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,620
yep justice Nick Farr hats as mentioned
before

91
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,840
in August 2007 a group of

92
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,540
North American hack as I should say
knots all of them were from the US

93
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,130
um visitors spaces and Germany and
Austria

94
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,750
mainly on they actually wanted to know
how are the places that

95
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,830
we have work how the self-organized te
collapse

96
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,320
work on um yeah after the case
communication camp

97
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,870
nearby then they just when rounds Europe

98
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:59,990
german-speaking Europe mainly and visit
a couple of the spaces

99
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,780
every space %uh that in the presentation
on its history

100
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,980
Antti we were thinking abouts

101
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,500
a good Smet 24 a of sharing our
experience with that

102
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,920
thing and we looked at design patents

103
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,200
um design patents ass most of you may
know

104
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,010
um I used in software engineering as a
term

105
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,010
form yeah typical situations where you
could

106
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,430
apply one approach to a solution um

107
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,980
and originated it come from been
planning

108
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,600
so a typical design pattern when
planning out to city would be

109
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,860
that you a would somehow have to have a

110
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,360
center for recreational things somewhere

111
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,600
and then you would put that pattern into
use in to your

112
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,140
design so arm

113
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,450
what is different %uh in this design
pattern metaphor from

114
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,760
that's a a cookbook metaphor we don't
think that's

115
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,789
giving you a step-by-step manual would
work because

116
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,960
the second census are very different and
you will run into very different

117
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,940
problems depending on your environment
that's

118
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,780
I rather we just want to provide a big
box of LEGO bricks

119
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,890
where you can ports where you can get
out a

120
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:28,890
test it patterns and then the your own
solution

121
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,570
yeah and of course your mileage may

122
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,060
very so arm

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,740
this isthat going to be the design
patterns

124
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,970
catalog first group world we

125
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:49,430
called sustainability patents so when
when starting a hackerspace you

126
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,470
half a chicken-and-egg problem a

127
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,540
should you concentrate on the
infrastructure art projects

128
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,050
and our solutions to that is that
everything

129
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,080
should be infrastructure driven you
should have rooms and power

130
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,229
and servers connectivity and other
facilities first

131
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,060
and and once you have the interest rate
infrastructure in place

132
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,430
um people will come up with amazing
projects that you didn't mention

133
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,530
in the first place this thing that
people will come up with things that you

134
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,389
didn't mention in the first place this

135
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,250
planning for the unexpected as also
something that you

136
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,300
world a see a lot of time span

137
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,659
when running yourself organize techa
that

138
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,090
so the at this is the place where we
have our network operations center in

139
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,289
Cologne

140
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,169
arm yep and many people that

141
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,930
actually as a talk about thats tomorrow
excuses that people use for Knotts

142
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,010
opening hackerspace um and one of the

143
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,740
um most often hurts excuses a is that
really the time now to stock a space

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,070
should you wait

145
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:02,010
had to really thought of all the
problems some people spend a lot of time

146
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,040
on

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,120
deciding very elaborate by Los or

148
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,170
a yeah just going through every possible

149
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,099
potential problem that them just migrant
run into and then

150
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,230
nothing gets done arm so we think that

151
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,970
the time is right now and its

152
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,180
always easier to ask forgiveness than to
get permission that's what

153
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:29,540
grace hopper one of the pioneers of
computer science

154
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,279
set was also a US Navy rear admiral

155
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,510
it's very important to to start many of
the problems you think of

156
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,620
vanish as soon as you get started and
when in doubt just to its

157
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:46,290
and yeah how can you communicate in such
a group

158
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,060
um we get asked that question but

159
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,950
we gonna really understand why because
you hack is and you should know what to

160
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,600
do

161
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,150
he said stop slacking and set up a
mailing list a wiki and I C channel and

162
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,959
you will need all three

163
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,550
arm actually you don't needs um

164
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,740
these things that I just mention but

165
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,940
you have to think along the lines of
what they provide

166
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,250
as a platform you will need a platform
to for discussion

167
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,730
maybe a mailing list and you will need a
storage for collaborative documentation

168
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,839
Wiki is a good idea and maybe using
media picking

169
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,230
a like the the software that powers
Wikipedia

170
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,330
and you will have to have something for
real-time communication

171
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:35,700
ISEE is one option but you could also
have fun

172
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,980
XMPP each other Sauber and do nifty
stuff

173
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,500
there is a and implementation of to the
server

174
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,220
that lets you share all the roast us
with all the members so

175
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,440
everyone who was in that group would be
on each other's

176
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,400
buddy lists um you were really needs all
these

177
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,920
three things exchanging a cell phone
numbers

178
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,170
can also help that you know you need
half

179
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,939
11 platform where you do extra
discussions and come to a conclusion

180
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,010
and may deal seems to be that medium for
that

181
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,790
you will have to document the stuff and
US from time to time you have to do

182
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,730
real-time communication most of the
failed attempts at creating a kiss

183
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,550
bassist

184
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,900
neglected one aspect or the other

185
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,560
that i've seen on some

186
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,940
also being alone doesn't help you you
want to

187
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,610
setup a space in the city alone and you
fail

188
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,529
we think from that you need to reach a
critical mass

189
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,710
and for us that's rule of thumb is two
plus two

190
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,300
persons a you need a partner

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,700
to kick around the initial vision and

192
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,550
exchange ideas about a that vision that
you have

193
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:57,339
and then you will need to more people
and others could to gets real work done

194
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,520
stuff like transportation transporting
physical

195
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,610
items and stuff um and you shouldn't

196
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,790
stop before you have at least four
people and

197
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,520
once you have that group of four people
its easy to recruit

198
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,649
more people because everyone has friends
and

199
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:19,700
it seems like 10 people as a start is a
good number for sustainable hackerspace

200
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,620
to half arm most attempts that the scene
where hecka spaces to of

201
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,080
really took of after they have reach
that point of

202
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,339
10 people and most failed attempts that
we've seen was just one person

203
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:39,970
and the City trying to do things on
their own

204
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,010
on so you would also have to me

205
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,950
strong personalities that's what we call
that pattern nothing gets done

206
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:51,730
that's a problem you all want the heck a
space but it's so hard to get off gases

207
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,250
um you should look for strong
personalities

208
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,760
in as members of the original group
people that have

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,910
experience and building structures and

210
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,459
what I find most important is look for
people who have authority and get

211
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,339
respect and not for people

212
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,620
who use authority and get laughter
especially

213
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:18,620
yeah im anti-authoritarian hecka circles

214
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,700
cocaine um in our infrastructure a.m.

215
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,580
all you you might think the I have not
properly American artist

216
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,220
flights but hope you don't mind

217
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,390
um the landlord and neighborhood poor

218
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,899
pattern is another patent for
infrastructure that we

219
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:42,320
arm see I maybe UF

220
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,350
you think you've found the perfect at
this pace but the

221
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,560
landlord a somewhat weird and the
neighbors are picking

222
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,520
and you should really reconsider if
thats space is the perfect space for you

223
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,120
because we think you should choose
wisely and benevolent

224
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,720
but uninterested landlord and cool
neighbors can be the decisive reason why

225
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,120
the

226
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,360
X base takes off or not I'm not so cool
neighbors may call the cops at 2am

227
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,970
depending on your projects this may be a
serious problem

228
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,360
I s hackers we do not lift the majority
lifestyle and you should look for

229
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,010
neighbors

230
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:21,290
were also weird and outside the majority
let me tell you something about

231
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,160
the neighbors we have a hackerspace and
cologne see form

232
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,380
we a have all had a space next to it
dominatrix

233
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,939
studium on just the seems to work

234
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,770
pretty well because they're interested
in privacy

235
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,649
and so we are um used to be a problem
like

236
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:47,420
having young unwashed computer people
are running

237
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,480
around a that line of waiting

238
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,330
businessman a in front of our neighbors
stores but

239
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,920
a we finally found a

240
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,600
a way to get its around that and also

241
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
I've heard that's this this just

242
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,980
goes bear without together I think in
America he said like

243
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,450
chocolate peanut butter um and

244
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,540
other hackerspace on dolphin in car
through in southern Germany

245
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,800
I de chez outta space with a from

246
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,149
I think gay you with organization or
something so

247
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,800
just realize that you do not live inside
the majority lifestyle and having

248
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,050
cool neighbors that also yeah outside
the majority

249
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,180
arm yet the stats that's a big point

250
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,720
I think

251
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,430
arm one question that always comes up is

252
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,500
arm it's really really expenses to pay
for the space

253
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,570
so maybe that guy who's really cool
could live

254
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,620
in there and we could just use that
space and all

255
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,980
maybe we could be flexion a ring and
have hecka space and that flat as well

256
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,839
on and yeah but that always calls us
privacy problems

257
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:06,890
um I don't think I've at the scene
that's

258
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:12,199
two workouts and a that's why our
suggestion for the problem is that

259
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,209
guess I really fine but you just done
leading

260
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:20,320
any wonder if they're and you should
keep the people out if necessary

261
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,899
we've had some really bad experience
with people just

262
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,330
making thats yeah the place where day
lift

263
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,730
and a in the ants a.m.

264
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,990
yeah privacy issues like someone wants
to bring over the girlfriend or

265
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,480
whatever on it's just inevitable

266
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,550
a.m. it should be like the perfect
living room

267
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,000
the hackerspace without anyone living
there no

268
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,100
arm yeah separate

269
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,769
that's a word I i made up because I
couldn't possibly find

270
00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,450
English word for that so I took French
what's um

271
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,490
what you want a half is a

272
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,209
well structured at I hecka space

273
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,290
with rooms to chill to discuss to work
in small groups

274
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,740
I'm when um the main room is occupy its

275
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,569
um you want to have a another place
where you can go to

276
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,260
and to split the group on this may be a

277
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,640
more of a european problem you want to
smoke a cigarette that space without

278
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,670
disturbing

279
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,459
non-smokers without

280
00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:33,150
disturbing nonsmokers or without
disturbing on smokeless

281
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,809
um depends on what side you on

282
00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,440
um so what be

283
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,679
what we found what's very practical

284
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,260
I have a hackerspace with small a
separate rooms and you can use curtains

285
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,360
a DOS

286
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,730
to separate them from the main room aunt

287
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,200
yup the smoke a question seem to come up

288
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,500
in in all the European expects a sign of
and

289
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,960
just having a smoke a swim works for us

290
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,020
so the the on the bottom of page you can
see

291
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,370
a how it is organized sports smaller
rooms that we have

292
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,830
with the main room and and smaller room
somewhere

293
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,909
group can work in arm

294
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,660
kitchen as a human being in food and a
sack in it Kissane

295
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,720
and food at all times so

296
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,830
one solution for that problem would be
to have a kitchen a space

297
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,110
and we think nothing brings a people
together

298
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,990
like cooking together half fridges for
clock martim

299
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,049
selling soft brings will have to raise
money for the rent actually

300
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,059
most of the space I know of selling

301
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,309
sufferings it's really a huge part of
that budget

302
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,010
and of how they finance this basis
sometimes

303
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,110
maybe half of the of the money comes
from

304
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,620
from selling brings and you should
invest in the single most important

305
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,770
piece of hardware a dishwasher

306
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:03,900
because that will and so many
discussions immediately

307
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,880
um and he said of the freezer for
pizza's and by decent

308
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,010
kitchen equipment um like really good
nice

309
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,660
and lots of pants and lots of parts and
t-shirts

310
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,950
shown us how to cook real food

311
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:21,630
that's the kitchen we haven't alone on
the

312
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,760
just a few weeks ago we had a visitor
from a NYC resistor

313
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,240
rose white was the and she taught us how
to make

314
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,890
the as young star Campbell which was
nice experience

315
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,270
on um yeah having a nice

316
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,350
cozy have two spaces the is an important
thing

317
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,260
all work and no play makes Jack a dull
boy there must be something else in

318
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,110
addition to just

319
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,380
workstations and electronics so

320
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,830
I think you should be equipped your
pikus-pace accordingly

321
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,409
he should bring in couches sofas
comfortable chairs

322
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,290
tables s face and a nice t requirement
projector

323
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,840
and video game consoles bringing in
plants didn't work for us

324
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,010
that well arm

325
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,640
actually effort that's at hackerspace in
New York City

326
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,510
and what's the resistor there was a task
force of two people who sets

327
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,549
no we don't think that's a natural or
like bringing in plants and

328
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:31,200
hecka spaces won't work so that right
and a failed

329
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,520
on so yeah that's that's one of the
rooms a

330
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,950
that we have for just relaxing

331
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:41,770
discussing the documentation of all

332
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,309
will plant you go up

333
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:50,740
God it may have something to do with the
local yes

334
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:56,040
I don't own

335
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,350
on yet after long had confessions

336
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,030
you with stuff that's not funny also
guess it to your space sometimes

337
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,360
nickname need acts personal hygiene

338
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,410
so on obvious solution for thats

339
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,179
and I think this is also like the gold
standard for hecka spaces

340
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:19,400
be used to have a map of all the region
a group of the

341
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,450
CAS Computer Club in Germany and all
spaces they had

342
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,540
and to have a special pictogram if that
space

343
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,909
hat a bathroom with the shower and we
think that discriminating hecka space

344
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,270
has a bathroom with a shower

345
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,510
because that's like going the extra mile

346
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,590
um after long hacking nights will have
the best

347
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,678
a TS by taking a shower this has
happened more than one time

348
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,929
someone working on a project and then I

349
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:48,660
at like six and a.m. in the morning on
they took a shower

350
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,460
and then suddenly the solution was there
guests from other spaces may stay

351
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,710
for several tweaks or death several days
which probably not that

352
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,030
wise but several days I would call them
or packers

353
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,610
I'm with little little a.m.

354
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,480
I little boxes at Ohakea space where
every member has a little box wait can

355
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,169
put

356
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:13,500
and hot where letters that were sent to
thats

357
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,840
apostles that was sent to the
hackerspace and there's also one box for

358
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,990
or packers and and that box we keep

359
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:24,169
extra peaceful guess and also we keep

360
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:27,770
like your random stuff like the

361
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,740
tickets for for museums and cologne so
they can do touristy stuff

362
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,530
what there was to know so so and

363
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,190
if you really really really want to go
for an extra effort you can buy

364
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,360
a washing machine to get rid of the
smell Italian its

365
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,480
which we did and then later we all
supported

366
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,280
dryer but maybe where over doing that
thing a bit

367
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:57,280
up so that so far from

368
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,669
yes are most question that people half
the

369
00:23:02,669 --> 00:23:06,929
I around that a thing of how to finance
the hackerspace

370
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,429
you need to pay your and utilities and
is

371
00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:15,240
this is where really the the recent
differences come into

372
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,059
its rather cheap for us in Germany to
have

373
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:22,190
a space like that and I A I know it's

374
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,350
almost impossible to have a cheap rent
in

375
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,650
New York City or anywhere that you would
want to live in New York City

376
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,090
on so yeah is this

377
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,139
really where you cannot make a
step-by-step

378
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,669
manual but you will have to find your
own creative solutions and people have

379
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,630
come up

380
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,460
with the various solutions for thats but

381
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,740
it basically boils down to that that you
have to it

382
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,480
half fees that you collect regularly I
thought that

383
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,260
um yeah if you don't have problems with
the privacy issues

384
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,299
papal works very well because it will
automatically

385
00:23:58,299 --> 00:24:01,510
collect the fees every month and you
don't have to run

386
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,169
of the people have you paid your fee
this month

387
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:09,000
and so on and you shouldn't make no
exceptions ever

388
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,370
I you should choose an appropriate
amounts like if you to say

389
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:18,320
from two hundred dollars per month than
I would say it's not appropriate because

390
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,030
um so many people simply wouldn't be
able to a fault that

391
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:26,980
I you should also think about having
discounts for students

392
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,260
we also thought about having discounts
for people who

393
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,809
a unemployed arm so this is just

394
00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:37,510
something that would have to discuss
with the group on

395
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,129
what we made as a rule and what I think
works very well as half

396
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:45,309
at least three-month a friend on the
account all the time

397
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:49,320
no exceptions because that would really
make you

398
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,460
sleep museum

399
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,370
um and you should elect totalitarian
treasure

400
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,299
I am someone actually

401
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:05,270
she I fell prey to a to the totalitarian
treasured just a month ago because

402
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,280
a life coach to pay

403
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,289
money fees and then he sent me an email

404
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:15,980
and didn't reply Islands a

405
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,070
and he out at me on our internal
meaningless

406
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:24,850
it was horrible

407
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,900
um sponsorship this the one question I
get asked a lot by Americans

408
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,240
a we have made only negative explains
puts

409
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,720
sponsorship so we call that the
sponsoring anti pattern

410
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,110
most people think it's a good idea to
meet at a company

411
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,750
that likes you or maybe at the
University where most of you study

412
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,370
anyway

413
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,650
and on I think I should stress that

414
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,410
um this is a rare really really bad idea

415
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:57,419
you should never ever depend just based
on external sponsors

416
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:00,960
the nation's like rates when when they
come from companies but

417
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,990
you should remember that companies can
go bankrupt and

418
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:08,320
when meeting at the University you won't
be a student forever

419
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,559
and also it creates kind of environment
meeting at the University will exclude

420
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,830
younger people like high school kids are
people who don't like the University

421
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,039
custom

422
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:22,450
and yeah having sponsorship from a
company means

423
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,799
several other problems no company in no
matter how nice will give up a presence

424
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,379
for ever

425
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,460
without asking for favors in return

426
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,950
that's just capitalism

427
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:39,470
arm next the have patents that I wanted
you saw

428
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,140
or patterns that have to do with the how
to have regular meetings

429
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:46,679
organizational patterns and a

430
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,700
if you want to have I if you want to
resolve internal conflicts

431
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,830
exercise democratic decision-making and
discuss recent

432
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:58,000
issues and future plan this just one

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,690
way to go arm we called its 10 on which

434
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,980
I was told as a very hi pro worden

435
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,600
English but a it just means the meeting
where everyone attends

436
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,679
a regular meeting with all members if
possible

437
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,780
you should have an agenda and set goals
may be discussed that

438
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,860
agenda before that on your mailing lists

439
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,059
and a make people commits themselves
tossed

440
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:26,879
like yeah we actually had a tradition of
banning

441
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,830
a sent insists that start with somebody
should

442
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:35,470
or the there should be something

443
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,539
or sometimes we should think about and
yet to spending that word

444
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:43,110
should and especially if it comes
together with somebody

445
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,820
the you should say stuff like I will
take care of

446
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,330
this problem I you should write on the
minutes of the meeting and post them

447
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:56,270
on the mailing list on the weekends and

448
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,820
yeah you should go for the only date
that works which is once a week

449
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,570
a I've seen so many ECA group fail
because

450
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,340
they don't go for that only take that
works once a week

451
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,250
which everyone can remember I it's that
they of the week

452
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:15,820
I will tell you later which status it's
that they of the week

453
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,840
on so I have to go to the meeting
tonight

454
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:23,059
or I cannot go to the meeting tonight
because I have an appointment

455
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:26,220
but that's no problem because I can go
next week

456
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,380
and I will just meet the meeting this
week

457
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,640
we at dates like first full moon after
the third by they will never work

458
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,100
and anything like every other week

459
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,590
won't work either arm because people
would just don't know

460
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,890
is that this week the meeting we or is
it

461
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,950
next week and what with months that have
like

462
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,220
five-week Senate just meet

463
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,830
once a week meet on Tuesdays

464
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,000
because every weekday sucks you will not
find

465
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,090
any day when every hecka can attend a
meeting

466
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,470
someone always has an appointment

467
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,500
so 2 seed solution be found for that was

468
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,590
meet on Tuesdays all day tho equally
thats

469
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,570
just pick Tuesday end of discussion

470
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,270
yeah yeah sheesh um

471
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:26,340
Exeter come some from the history of the
case Computer Club

472
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:30,610
when the case Computer Club was found
its a it started with the

473
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,730
little at and then a tentative daily
newspaper

474
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,799
with someone put up I'm not saying
hackers want it

475
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,700
and stay matte at that office of thats

476
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:44,929
a tentative newspaper the targets set on

477
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,990
and the only day that was a available
for a meeting of

478
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,520
hackers into nineteen well in nineteen
eighty

479
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,168
imagine that a the only data was
available for them both

480
00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:00,200
that you stay was Tuesday so they they

481
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,270
met on Tuesday and Tuesday's just a
perfect day someone was a

482
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:09,020
all I cannot possibly coming to stay out
of this class on Tuesday

483
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,960
yeah but this is true for every other
day in the week

484
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,020
to um and also

485
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,780
this may change in a few months um yet
maybe that's the person doesn't have

486
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,649
that class

487
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:26,289
on to say anymore and then another
person will have a problem with the

488
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:27,720
cheese state but

489
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,030
to stay with it it's easier

490
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:37,309
he will spare yourself a lot of needless
discussions

491
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,330
oh yeah um one thing that we do at or
hex basis

492
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,449
the a an event called open chaos

493
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,210
and we many do that to draw in new
people and provides an interface to the

494
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,419
outside world

495
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:54,809
we have a monthly public and open
lecture

496
00:30:54,809 --> 00:30:58,720
talk or workshop a which be announce a
no web sites

497
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,210
nestle was interesting topics sometimes
it's about

498
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:08,360
the privacy laws a or someone will talk
about computer security stuff

499
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,590
or what you have a I think that'll

500
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:14,960
lost talk we had to force on

501
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,480
EPC hacking and the talk before that was

502
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,980
on and was he was just

503
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,690
I am by against from the United States

504
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,919
and us use that as a filter for bringing
new people to the group

505
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,299
used to have a very open meetings
sandwiches which just announce on our

506
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:39,330
website that our internal meetings %uh
every Tuesday

507
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,740
and then would get a bunch

508
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:45,990
weirdoes people with this law and our

509
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,870
I A's and that would say things like

510
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,570
you if we team up like to CCC and myself

511
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,629
then we can really defeat the Illuminati
and

512
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:00,250
I'm

513
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,150
yeah didn't work out that well so

514
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,299
we have this open lecture every month

515
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:11,220
where we can one can come being a weirdo
or not

516
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,620
arm and we just scout for interesting
people

517
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,750
and um if you think they're cool people

518
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:21,000
we just tell them hey you should come on
Tuesday

519
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,600
as well and we don't have the way it is

520
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,039
arm another thing that we do a.m. and
which

521
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,150
will happen I in a few months

522
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:37,360
is what we call u23 arm

523
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,429
the in Germany this them

524
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:43,860
soccer Championships half this I think
this a

525
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,520
u21 team so everyone younger than 21

526
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,629
we thought 23 was a better number arm

527
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,880
we wanted to draw in younger people
because

528
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,230
the obvious problem you have off to some
years as a

529
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,320
or the members credit from college I get
another job in a different city or get

530
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,970
married

531
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:06,480
are basically a space just needs fresh
blood

532
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,150
what we do to solve that problem is we
have a challenge

533
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:13,279
for younger people that we set up for
them

534
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,309
and and form of course that spend
several weeks

535
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:22,158
I'll the first born with it was actually
building robots with Lego Mindstorms

536
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,289
a building a robot that put REIT in

537
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:28,470
a pa coat and then

538
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,120
perform actions on on that barcode and
then

539
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,250
we also had a software project which was

540
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,900
a rights a chat protocol implement a
test protocol

541
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,500
that would be hit and then ICMP packets
so

542
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,610
I the sysadmin at your school would see
that you

543
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:50,880
using the network for testing I

544
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,020
and we tend to make that challenges

545
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,980
a bit harder than a it could be.

546
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,600
a then it it would be by splitting the
person because we actually won

547
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,400
the people to work in teams we provide

548
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,668
tutoring and we we push them in the
right direction this moment we do

549
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,668
a a reference implementation of the
project before that

550
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:17,908
but a it's usually too hot for someone

551
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,220
um whose just a high school

552
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:26,000
to yeah to like you UNIX system
programming on the network level

553
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,050
for chat server so abut but

554
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,859
working in a group would work very well
and the result that we had with that was

555
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:34,668
that

556
00:34:34,668 --> 00:34:37,819
all these pose a people talking bake

557
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,050
arm with Dan Ashe after the week to

558
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,109
because they found out that they
actually

559
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,848
had to work on something that they
actually had to do teamwork

560
00:34:47,849 --> 00:34:51,980
and then arm we were left with the
really smartest

561
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,500
kits a that finish the project it's not

562
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,700
a problem if they don't finish the
project the

563
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,800
the thing is just that they learn
something and that aren't

564
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,740
we should give them room to experiment
and after that

565
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:10,690
you can retire after the team building
and let the smartest of the young ones

566
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,220
run the space and this actually what we
do in Cologne on

567
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,530
I mean I go there regularly to to have a
clue martyr

568
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:20,820
or heck on projects but a

569
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:24,700
yeah I mean to stir the gamble on
state-run index Li

570
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:28,730
and I'm glad for that

571
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,859
p this is the a problem that comes

572
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:37,920
in after some yes if you if you're
building a hackerspace now you may not

573
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,770
see it but he will see it in the near
future

574
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:45,920
um you did everything right and get some
picket fence like maybe a call on

575
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,609
attack a space like your town and you
had a nice time

576
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:53,490
get it projects but after some time the
enthusiasm goes away

577
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,930
and your projects are stagnating this
will

578
00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:00,049
eventually happen without exception

579
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,130
and with actually found a patent for
that

580
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,230
on yeah we think that pecans with the
ISM

581
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,310
and I guess pace at the form of a sine
curve with a psych the duration of four

582
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,810
years

583
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:18,290
so like at first everyone is really
really

584
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,349
energetic about everything and then it
will slowly go down

585
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,700
and then arm yeah after four years

586
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:30,060
amazing things will happen again but you
should remember to keep your tax base

587
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,710
running

588
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,520
even if the if you got sectors
temporarily a holiday

589
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,960
intense the quote that your space would
be awesome again in two years

590
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,480
so you shouldn't give up and a always

591
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,480
prepare for the an expected maybe a new
exciting

592
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,680
member will knock in New door tomorrow
and is actually happened at the space

593
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,950
and both form

594
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:55,770
where a lot of people who were much into
computer security

595
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:59,020
and into programming we're running a
space and then

596
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:03,080
at some point someone awesome hey do you
do

597
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,348
electronics as well soldering stuff and
they said no

598
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:11,050
we which is coding away and trying to
find box in

599
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,790
and security things and said well I
could teach you how to

600
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:18,320
how to solder and how to build
electronic projects aren't

601
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,349
from that totally transformed that
pikus-pace

602
00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:24,550
asleep or simple home which is now full
of

603
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,880
blinking things and a.m.

604
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,060
yeah basically they do nothing else but
microcontroller

605
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,740
programming and building projects both
electronics

606
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,930
so even if you didn't have that idea in
mind

607
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,930
and Q always thought of you had a space
as having

608
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,899
you know a a stress on thats

609
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,619
aspect of Agriculture things may change
in the future and

610
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,880
a.m. yeah chance so good that that will
change for the better

611
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,640
even if at the moment you don't have

612
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,740
that infusium it to you Seth

613
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,790
um conflict resolution is a very

614
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,080
important problem um i've seen

615
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,339
a lot of drama at a lot of haikus basis
and a lot of

616
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:16,070
screaming and yelling and arm

617
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,390
I know that many people find these
catalogue of design patterns impressive

618
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:23,910
but actually it's not that impressive if
you look at the stories behind it

619
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,290
because

620
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,790
I we did every stupid mistake

621
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:32,180
we could and then be wrote just bow down
what

622
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,790
what worked for us a so you don't have
to do

623
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:39,339
all the steep its mistakes that we did
on

624
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,660
so keep that in mind if you think while
how did they come

625
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:48,020
up with that it's the it's because we
were stupid

626
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:51,170
um one thing of

627
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,540
how to resolve convents how to resolve
problems

628
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:58,310
a tax base would go for consensus if you
a

629
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,349
me to make a group decision and want to
make sure that no one gets left behind

630
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:06,910
he use that weekly plan on for
discussions and you shouldn't take votes

631
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:11,500
discuss until everyone agrees and we
think for some problems this patterns

632
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,240
the best

633
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,410
second-best maybe is democracy in

634
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,410
you need to make it group decision
discussing

635
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,450
does not seem to leak anywhere again

636
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:28,630
a typical example is a should our

637
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:31,940
space be smoke-free or should be half

638
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,369
exceptions a everyone has a strong
opinion upon

639
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:38,500
on that and you cannot really find a
consensus

640
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,230
but you can see what the majority of the
group things

641
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,050
I you should use the weekly plan for
discussion and

642
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,080
if you see okay this can only be
resolved through

643
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,259
playing or democracy than the strongest
my OT wins

644
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,290
over the weekend minorities and for some
problems

645
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:59,720
this pattern is the best

646
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,240
and lasts but not least the common
pattern

647
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,119
problem we have is nobody does the
dishes to hackerspace looks crappy

648
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,430
no one seems to care than you should
implements

649
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:13,569
this conflict resolution pattern

650
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,690
you should order people to do the dishes
take out the trash

651
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,950
keep the infrastructure up and running
yell if necessary

652
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,050
but you should always participates just

653
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:27,130
you know screaming and a ordering people
want her pp should

654
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:31,490
participate for some problems this
pattern is the best you see

655
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,339
they'll contradict each other and a.m.

656
00:40:35,339 --> 00:40:42,130
you will have to experiment which pet
and to apply to what situation

657
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,440
this is the name that I stole from a

658
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,099
a hackerspace which is currently

659
00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:52,480
not in existence but in planning state

660
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,480
no splits in San Francisco on their
mailing this

661
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,930
the hat to very very nice words Soo Do

662
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:02,118
leadership and um because I think

663
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:05,760
good at yes deserve to be stolen and
stole it um

664
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,859
the problem that he my may run into

665
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:13,660
if especially if you have this strong
personality plate patterned implemented

666
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,420
if a community of like-minded people are
you started out it's that

667
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:22,540
but suddenly you find yourself in a
dictatorship run by a single hecka

668
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,540
on this is not swat what happened at
Noisebridge

669
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:30,730
of course that there were thinking about
how to prevent such a situation

670
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,839
um and they came up with that very very
clever

671
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:37,328
name suit a leadership um you should not
have

672
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,500
ranks of course if you incorporate

673
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,550
a on the organization that one sack a
space

674
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,050
you must have theoretically on the paper
someone who is

675
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,410
head of that organization or whatever
the legal framework

676
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,078
in your country is but a you shouldn't
pay

677
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,290
too much attention to that you should
not have an officer

678
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,740
of blah blah blah or whatever you should

679
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,800
use leadership leadership just
temporarily actual projects

680
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,079
when someone has this say okay we need
to ban

681
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:13,530
to go to that place now I want you to
drive that ban

682
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,530
a but you should not have a single whose
account

683
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,820
on your ECA space

684
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:24,320
self-love and eyes that's the point

685
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,420
arm responsibility

686
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,500
yeah that's the problem I A I I see a
lot of times you volunteered for the

687
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,599
task of learning

688
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,440
critic piece of infrastructure for
instance the mates over

689
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,390
but you feel the sudden urge to slack

690
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:44,680
and its how to get around that's problem
as

691
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,549
a.m. to strip to remember that just
because volunteer work

692
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,960
a doesn't get paid doesn't mean it's
less important to remember that you

693
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,760
would directly hurt your friends

694
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,510
and at the hackerspace a few let them
down

695
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:02,150
take pride in your dirty work it will
make you grow stronger as a person and a

696
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,630
satisfying

697
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:06,829
and you realize that you really cannot
do the job anymore

698
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:12,510
you last talked task is to hand it over

699
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,849
debate culture your in the middle of
your weekly plan on

700
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:18,940
every what's yelling nothing gets done

701
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,480
that's a problem with we see very often
and we think

702
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,310
that's because many geeks have very poor
debate skills which is the result of

703
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,230
yourself

704
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,430
flame was on the net we think

705
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,470
you should make people with actual
social skills lead to discussions

706
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,670
and we have found out that those with a
background in real life political works

707
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,460
like student council

708
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,920
were best pro group these that will use
to working with agendas and

709
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,960
meeting minutes and having list of
speakers

710
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,420
and a calling people to order and stuff

711
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:58,050
and moderating the group discussion and
it's actually a skill that you can done

712
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:01,060
just like learning a new programming
language you can learn

713
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,119
from people who know how to it

714
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:08,910
discussed things and you can done not to
interrupt that this

715
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,940
it's worth per burning it

716
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,230
um yep this

717
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:18,880
is something that maybe yes familiar to

718
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,099
FreeBSD hackers we call it the bike said
and Tibetan

719
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,560
and a.m. it sounds complicated but it's
a problem that's

720
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:31,490
I'm sure we're everyone in this room has
a has seen

721
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,060
arm you suggest creating something for
you hecka States

722
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,589
like a pie except butts everybody it's
now talking about

723
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:43,950
bike ships color and then no bike sect

724
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,650
would be built that's a it's a known
problem

725
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,320
if you suggest something that anyone in
your hecka space can build

726
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,740
they would take part in the discussion
especially if it's only the kind of the

727
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:56,720
bike set

728
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,960
did design of the t-shirts the Linux
distribution on the service is set three

729
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,150
separate

730
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:05,960
notes tend to discuss to the problems in
at the teeter

731
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,010
one more complex task will be ignored
and you should

732
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,160
just identify pointless discussions like
these and

733
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,970
and them for instance as a hypothetical

734
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:19,010
case I you're discussing

735
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:22,530
use this for a laser at your hackerspace

736
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,900
but the laser is not there already and

737
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,329
you don't have an idea how to finance
that

738
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:33,270
so may be gone back and and saying

739
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,619
okay I think this discussion this

740
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:41,070
somewhat pointless if we don't even know
how to get that lays there yet

741
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:47,650
um would be a good idea

742
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,050
so the bike set problem actually comes
from from the book

743
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,560
this even the website on that's problem
back said

744
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,759
comes from book Pakistan I

745
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,570
he a wrote a book in the early 1960s
call Pakistan lost

746
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:07,250
which contains a insight into the
dynamics of Management

747
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:12,180
in the specific example involving the
bikes at the other white a compliment

748
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:16,230
boss and atomic power plant I guess that
illustrates the age of the book

749
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:20,570
a oxen shows how you can go into with
the board of directors

750
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,079
and get approval for burning a
multi-million even

751
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,640
billion dollar Tomic power plant but if
you want to build a bike shit

752
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,140
you would be tangled up in interest
discussion and everyone wants to

753
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,618
lestat a the fingerprint on it

754
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:38,730
and said you know the color of thats

755
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:44,750
I'd shows but if you propose something
really complex and something really huge

756
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:48,599
like this atomic power plant people
would just go along and say

757
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,040
ya I don't know much about that II guess
they thought

758
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,670
thought about it earlier so I i
shouldn't say anything about that

759
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:02,980
um sometimes people cause a problem that
cannot be

760
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,210
result in a group people are just
causing troubles

761
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,930
um because the private talk pattern
which

762
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,098
we found very effective if some Experian

763
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:17,250
experienced member of the group would
talk to the troublemaker and private

764
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,869
and listen to that person and let them
know how the group feels about the

765
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:21,560
problem

766
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,589
with out exposing them in front of the
group

767
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:28,839
this is actually a something that you
could do it to

768
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,020
pretense drama and flame fests your
mailing lists

769
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,380
just talk to the person in private its

770
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,180
so then we have some miss can use
patterns

771
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:46,560
arm old hot where people whispering in
you

772
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,839
the new hardware that yet some point
you're

773
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:54,490
a hackerspace just becomes a hot museum
filled with junk

774
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,030
you shirts create a pilot stack week
with

775
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:01,619
all its unused hardware that everyone
take from thats

776
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,750
anything left after a month should be
thrown away

777
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:08,430
but you should make sure you announced
that stepped not only once

778
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,690
but at least three times using an
escalation system

779
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:15,710
on being germans we put that into law

780
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:18,720
are a

781
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,960
it's in German I'm sorry but I will
translate it

782
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,069
I'm so that's the law about providing
hardware in the chaos lap

783
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:30,690
the kale slap is AV the in and I meant

784
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,089
of extraordinary order and

785
00:48:34,089 --> 00:48:38,790
tidiness where the case computer club
cologne

786
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,579
a us their work on

787
00:48:42,579 --> 00:48:46,460
we define cleaning up personal s person

788
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:50,680
a who the care about the state of the
clubroom

789
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,419
and cleaning up personal always

790
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:57,530
a mmm has a hero status

791
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,670
and immunity against the

792
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:06,280
hostile attacks of a owners of not
functional hardware

793
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,690
et cetera et cetera it goes on the Y and

794
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:14,800
um so this is all a stack of all top we
have if

795
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,869
you we need I'm on it or arm

796
00:49:17,869 --> 00:49:20,960
you could just grab one um and

797
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:24,869
a of sometimes we just so them all its

798
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,089
we define on functional hot whereas
every hardware

799
00:49:28,089 --> 00:49:33,099
where we don't know what function tests
where there's no contact address

800
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:37,410
printed on it where snow routes passport
known

801
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:41,129
a weighty where we possibly couldn't
imagine

802
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,589
any use for that and a.m.

803
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:49,009
also if it's like just collecting dust
in the corner

804
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,710
um and has not been switched on in like

805
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,119
two months it may be considered as
non-functional

806
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,910
and we have to be that streak because
its

807
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:05,399
yet you with tongue your hackerspace
into the heartland museum

808
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,310
really really quickly if you don't take
that extreme actions

809
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,578
um keys you want to have fewer hecka
space accessible all the time you don't

810
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,900
want to call someone else tonight's

811
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,940
to look tax base when you leave

812
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:23,010
the solution for that is handout keys
track

813
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:26,079
who owns a key at make a list have a
good luck

814
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,180
so that nobody can copy two key without
your permission

815
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,368
part depends on where you live butts on

816
00:50:34,369 --> 00:50:38,680
at this we have that in Germany and she
should collected deposit for the key so

817
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,799
that the owner takes care of it

818
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,599
I all you could also birds a complicated
electronic locking system with cards and

819
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,069
RFID send

820
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:51,349
yeah and you will have all the core
benefits and all the massive problems

821
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:52,210
that come with that

822
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:55,599
but be think that's just plane old
hardware

823
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,609
keys work the best um

824
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:01,799
and yeah you want to raise funds

825
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:05,700
you want to stay up longer at night this
is a problem that you consult with

826
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:09,540
buying at least one pallet of took Marta
and selling it in the hackerspace

827
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,980
and you well realize the results very
soon this is a

828
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:20,680
some of the matter we keep in our hecka
space

829
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,460
let me just sets this that this is not a
step-by-step manual

830
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:27,700
there's more than one way to both your
hecka space and paste

831
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,450
on your backgrounds there may be a
couple of patents which maps and some

832
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,069
patterns

833
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:36,190
even contradict each other you should be
creative you should experiment

834
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:39,740
and a above all you should start your
own hackerspace

835
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,960
Oracle to your nearest expats

836
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,400
on this is a very very incomplete list
of ECA spaces

837
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,069
that's a.m. i've seen just

838
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:54,310
befall that conference my friends the

839
00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,430
problem in key from the and I start its

840
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:00,750
hecka spaces start awk which is going to
be

841
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:04,859
a a starting point for yeah organizing a
kiss bassist

842
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:08,950
word whites a which would have huge list
of

843
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:15,950
Axxess bases around the world's thank
you very much

844
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,849
do we have time for questions or I
already took too much time right

845
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:32,500
okay I tend to stick sought announcement
I think tomorrow at 3

846
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:36,190
p.m. I am there would be a work sup at
downstair

847
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,260
at dunya and down the elevator

848
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,280
um and that area which is the
hackerspace

849
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:45,310
billets and if you have any specific
questions

850
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:49,009
um used should just go there and find me
and

851
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:50,700
we can talk about that thank you very
much
