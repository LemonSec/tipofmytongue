1
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:10,889
the

2
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,210
alright

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,050
Sony talking with you today where to
start off with that history of

4
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,770
identification cards in general

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,920
and go through an overview about
influential corporations

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,080
on how identification cards and driver's
licenses

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,320
and became and how they

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,400
ended how they are today wanna talk
about the Real ID Act which is a very

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,930
controversial subject and especially
today especially a

10
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,280
amongst the presidential candidates

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,280
on we're gonna talk a little bit about

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,100
immaturity manufacturing am to try to do
a quick demo

13
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,780
I was going to kind have

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,350
I take someone from the audience and
make them a new identification

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,470
I was actually gonna give out new
identification is for everybody

16
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,170
but an if you would have like it will be
a problem if I did that so

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,360
what ended up happening is my my printer

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,780
but I took with me on the EQ exploded on
the airplane

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,979
so unfortunately

20
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,979
I medic a a Quick Print you can see here

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,969
it's in pretty bad shape world maybe you
can see if it's in pretty bad shape but

22
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:31,360
we'll get to that in a little bit

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
on anymore

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,170
conclude with some a high tech ID
concepts that hopefully you'll be seeing

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,899
in future

26
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,609
on this is an overview

27
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:47,579
love we'll be discussing during history
identification cards we talk about fake

28
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:48,390
ID's

29
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,759
on valid government uses and an

30
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,869
influential corporations so

31
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:57,939
identification card started off with

32
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,280
driver's licenses on you know basically
with the automobile

33
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,899
and this happened in Germany and France
in the nineteen hundreds

34
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:08,800
and quickly became adopted in the United
States around 1910

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,530
and as more and more people begin
driving on becoming became the de facto

36
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,080
form

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,420
identification you know throughout the
world I'm and you know the inherent

38
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,630
follow the whole system that

39
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,019
they were never designed to be
identification cards and that problem

40
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,340
still exists today

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,680
so and its its arm

42
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,240
you you can't really go about your day
to day basis without a proper form

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,310
identification and I

44
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,950
you know I'd like to hear stories if
anyone that doesn't happen if a cation

45
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,360
you know government-issued
identification that lives in normal life

46
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,950
so in New Moon in New York see you do
you leave the city

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,950
09 exactly

48
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,470
exactly good

49
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,850
right so there are good

50
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,910
on there are uses for identification and
does do things like protect your privacy

51
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,720
abuse you are you

52
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,270
an end and that's you know get you one
other people assuming

53
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:12,570
your identity so and like we just
discussed it makes things like travel

54
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,989
work in purchasing

55
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,450
possible on a problem we see many
foreign countries

56
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,930
is you can be stopped and harassed

57
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,760
you know you can you have to have your
identification documents on hand

58
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,620
wherever you go

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,190
and not having these documents can be
detrimental the

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,740
and this is an emerging from the US

61
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,660
you know we'd don't have this but we
currently don't have this problem

62
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,370
especially post-9/11

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,350
as someone just mentioned on we've been
seeing is

64
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:47,299
the as a as the problem we need to
address and prevent so

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,600
so

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,200
we have been seeing fraudulent
certificates in cards and penalties

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,000
increasing an this is mainly due to

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,460
increased concerns the legal immigration
on

69
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,150
old many the scapegoat what I believe
has been scapegoats to

70
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,610
on the increased penalties have been you
in response to 9/11

71
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,780
I'm you can sponsor is a terrorist Taney

72
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,269
real estate and education cards if
you're familiar with the terrorist

73
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,750
detainee identification cards

74
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,310
during 9/11 actually obtain legitimate
documents through

75
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,280
on which image channels this amid
fraudulent information

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,880
through their local TV yessir Department
champion transportation

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,060
and you know I don't think this is a
good

78
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,700
I'm response to the subjectivity because
if you're at

79
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,909
Terrace near about skin you know commit
like some type of mass crime towards

80
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,300
society you not gonna worry that year
the penalty towards

81
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,790
on towards your driver's license just
went from a

82
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,960
you know classy to a class A misdemeanor
when you're about to kill you

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
few hundred people so and then there's
the increase whereas the underage

84
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,650
drinking

85
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,720
an you know i personal think this is a
very good way to solve this problem

86
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,890
you know people you drinking binge drink

87
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:12,280
on if you you know it a major for
identification

88
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,580
has never been a problem there's online
retailers and

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,479
all you know everyone smaller government
shutdown yields retailer

90
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,230
and a new more pop up within the next
week and those documents a pretty high

91
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,139
quality there based overseas

92
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,230
many race in Canada the laws in Canada

93
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,750
our way so that if you can't prove that

94
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,340
a fake identification card is being used
for illegal activity

95
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,389
then you can manufacture than and we see
this in British Columbia namely

96
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,730
and there's I legal identification card
shops around town

97
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,020
you know you going to get your picture
taken and the

98
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,909
you know that identification cards look
surprisingly similar surreal

99
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,210
identification cards are

100
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,960
government-issued cars there's fake ID
rains which mainly target

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,250
the legal immigration and legal
immigrants

102
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,450
and we see those getting shut down I'm
on a very large scale basis

103
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:08,010
because they're usually pretty open with
theirs with their techniques

104
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,139
and then you can the biggest problem
that we see that

105
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:14,110
you know should not be a problem by any
means and should be addressed

106
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:14,740
immediately

107
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,260
is the obtaining fraudulent Vicky

108
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,240
fraudulent Bekasi carsey with Jimmy
channels so that's

109
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,450
assuming the identity over you know a
dead neighbor

110
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,830
or relatives on ands

111
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,359
summing these applications to your local
department transportation for DPS

112
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,400
on the a problem we probably won't ever
be able to address is corrupt government

113
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
employees

114
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,700
ans you know there will be means to
suppress this behavior but

115
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,800
you know it's something that will
probably always be a problem

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
I seen government pleas charging upwards
to

117
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,139
ten thousand dollars for a single
driver's license and you know

118
00:06:54,139 --> 00:07:00,840
I'm with that kind of cash involved
months that being stopped anytime soon

119
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,320
sewn this is a chart identifying you
know how you'd

120
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,280
attain a on driver's license or
identification card

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,470
your local department transportation DPS
and none in this information is new

122
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,710
imagine everyone's been through this
process at least 10 times

123
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,430
and if you don't have a social security
number a social security card

124
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,480
you know you apply for that through your
Social Security ministration

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,300
if you soon your identity of another
person there's ways to

126
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,500
on yet this card by presenting
fraudulent information

127
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,180
and again the same way through the Vital
Records Office on getting birth

128
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,930
certificates

129
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,520
so the point is that when you actually
applied to the public transportation you

130
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,400
can present

131
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,800
illegitimate documents ans obtain

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,460
a a authentic talking with fraudulent
information on it your face

133
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,949
and information now the problem we see
with

134
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,830
most states the United States is they do
not validate the information

135
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,460
with the Val with the breeder documents
or what they're called the doc the

136
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,000
beer documents are known as the your
Social Security card for your birth

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,410
certificate

138
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,400
and they do not validate these documents
with the vital records officer the

139
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Social Security Administration

140
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,180
so they have no proof that you are who
you are

141
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,449
I am what hell happened is

142
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:23,990
what the states will do is the issue
identification card ans

143
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,350
you know six months later they'll
realize the issued some indication card

144
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:27,810
that

145
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,460
wasn't actually than and by then it's
too late if the person already has

146
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,810
the car so some influential
organizations we have Digimarc

147
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,959
Corporation

148
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:41,289
which is like the Microsoft up the
identification card interest

149
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,010
industry and they make about two-thirds
the US jerry's licenses which is a huge

150
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,430
number

151
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:51,680
home there most likely you make billion
dollars

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,910
you billions of dollars of the Real ID
Act and you know

153
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,469
going to discuss that unit on the next
sixty million identification documents

154
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,249
per year they produced

155
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,309
identification documents for twenty-five
countries including both

156
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:10,339
poorer countries Canada and Mexico they
pretty much on

157
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,100
most the world history l1 I'm not too
familiar with this company

158
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,360
and they produce somewhere between
one-third the rest of the US driver's

159
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,449
licenses

160
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:23,069
now if you go to your DPS Department
Transportation Office

161
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:26,849
and they give you aid driver's license
onsite

162
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,050
right after getting your picture taken
then that means that

163
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,189
the state individually produces their
own drivers license

164
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:37,079
and these documents are usually the only
secure he's lied to you

165
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,079
the reproduce

166
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,480
legally there's the a MVA which is my
favorite

167
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,089
in government organization namely
because the

168
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:53,040
actor and singer American Association
motor vehicle administrators

169
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,540
an you say that ten times best

170
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,849
in the annual ill you know when the REAL
ID Act is implemented will be kinda the

171
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,319
main coordinator between states

172
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,579
on you so many other major players in
the

173
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm formulation the REAL ID Act and
knees

174
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,790
the organizations will you be mainly
affected by the acts

175
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,990
so you can pick your favorite

176
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,230
acronym list

177
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,170
so on to the Real ID Act really talk
about the purpose

178
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,059
legislative history an the outline
standards requirements and

179
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,790
most interesting part is the controversy

180
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,559
so its original purpose was to stylish

181
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:49,279
new standards for state-issued driver's
licenses

182
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,490
so he may use for federal purposes on

183
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,449
and then Department of Homeland Security
said these federal purposes words to you

184
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,970
an for citizens you're born in
commercially operated airline flights

185
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,970
and three federal buildings

186
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,129
and nuclear power plants so

187
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:10,639
I'm about you guys only pretty upset if
my I'd even when you get into nuclear

188
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,759
power plants

189
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,759
minutes I'm cons so

190
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,019
basically what's gonna happen is if your
ID isn't your ID compliant

191
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,209
on in your states not enrolled in the
program when the time comes you knocking

192
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,740
you to fly

193
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,399
ans you federal buildings or sign-up
post offices and scored houses federal

194
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,639
courthouses

195
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,730
and things like that and I don't know
how strict they are gonna be with that

196
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,800
you know making the I don't they the
Union

197
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,730
extend the time that you in the post
office is a key you know except ID's

198
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,170
sounds pretty ridiculous on

199
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:48,290
additionally Kirby fraud and other
identification the crimes

200
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,189
and most of all the entire system is
related around

201
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,790
prevents the legal aliens from taking
any federalize

202
00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,920
any federally recognize the unification
and this is one of the main issues

203
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,219
and there see you serve leone's on your
fly

204
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,809
you know sendmail on go to court

205
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:12,459
it's a mean it's gonna be a big deal and
you know there's a lot of opponents this

206
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,550
issue

207
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,860
and a lot of proponents this issue

208
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,230
so representative james sensenbrenner
Wisconsin attach it to the

209
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,980
emergency supplemental appropriations
act for defense global War on Terror

210
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,019
and tsunami relief it's a military
spending bill

211
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,540
on no Senate committee hearings were
actually delivered

212
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,480
on the Real ID Act itself so no
discussion was ever conducted upon it

213
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,259
and

214
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:40,179
you know as bassist attached to this
must pass bill

215
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:44,689
on that happen in 2005 and after you
know if you'd always

216
00:12:44,689 --> 00:12:48,689
will soon as next slide and it

217
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:54,290
you know what will happen is in 2011 all
states must be enrolled in the program

218
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,329
on this

219
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:02,300
slides really confusing I was in trouble
explaining it but

220
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,970
basically phase 1 and phase 2 there is
like a budget problems

221
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,410
and and third some delays phase

222
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,079
and then so by 2011

223
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:18,660
you know the states must been on the
program between 2011 and 2014

224
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,199
on all citizens issued new
identification cards under the age of 50

225
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,489
must have relied the acts compliant
identification cards

226
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:32,230
sorry for driver's licenses now

227
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,879
this doesn't mean that if your ID that
you currently have doesn't expire

228
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:39,949
you know it's all 2014 else you'll still
be able to use it

229
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,160
so but after 2014

230
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,170
your ID if your ID is not relax complain
then you won't be able to you

231
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,769
fly answer government building on

232
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:59,769
and then same thing goes for citizens
over the age of 50 in Seoul 2017

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,839
on so thus

234
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,269
out once and requirements for the REAL
ID Act are much different than what the

235
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,549
current standards are most states

236
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:14,399
and this is kind of unfortunate the
things are different are perfect that

237
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,249
all databases from every department
sensational DPS office in the United

238
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:20,839
States must be linked together

239
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,189
so if someone applies for a driver's
license in Texas then

240
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,779
in California they'll be 0 to the debt
Texas office will be to say well you

241
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:31,079
already have a driver's license issued
California

242
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,970
would you like us to make that inactive
you say we'll know I

243
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:39,509
my I still live in California it comes
to sex in the summer unions and say well

244
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:42,910
sorry can issue to you driver's licenses
you know

245
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,238
and this is gonna be a big problem
because you know the weakest link in the

246
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,029
chain

247
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:51,189
is gonna be the on thing that
compromises the whole system so if

248
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:52,589
there's a security issue

249
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,559
in Texas and then someone may be able to
have access to the entire system

250
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,699
everybody's a.m. driver's license or
identification card information

251
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,999
now the data retention storage outlines

252
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:10,619
the require that everybody's information
be held on file for fifteen years

253
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:14,829
mean of the skin in your birth your
photo I the skin your photo or non photo

254
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:15,769
ID

255
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,029
on file and your birth certificate
including your documentation will skate

256
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,019
status and keep that on file for up to
15 years

257
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:29,399
so and no include that in the database
that will be accessed by every state

258
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:34,499
and most important of all they will love
begins to validate Peter documents with

259
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:37,610
the Social Security Administration

260
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,399
on and the

261
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,399
other office

262
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,149
the that validates like birth
certificates for those or

263
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,889
anyways their data requirements this is
also been a big issue

264
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:57,139
I am included in every card must have

265
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,319
common she machine-readable technology
so although

266
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:03,970
every state may issue different cards
with different designs

267
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,249
on they almost have the same type of
machine readable technology wetherbee

268
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:13,589
RFID or a 2d barcode

269
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,689
on for 3d barcode

270
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,910
whether to use 3d 3d

271
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,389
okay and and they must include the full
name date of birth gender the driver's

272
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:26,119
license

273
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,629
and a digital photograph and signature
so this is basically all your

274
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,269
information

275
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:34,910
%um surprise it doesn't include your
social security numbers well

276
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,139
and otherwise the cards are no different
than the current standards

277
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,449
and this is news is very disturbing
because white

278
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:45,299
a region what might you know while
talking with people in the industry

279
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,489
doing research this project

280
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:50,519
on I was up

281
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,959
you know I was talking with you know the
number one reason the home

282
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,049
Homeland Security in james sensenbrenner
introduce this bill

283
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,309
was so we could have in New
identification document

284
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:03,779
that was high-security

285
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,179
you know on you know unable to reproduce
you know basically a new document that

286
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,439
could not be

287
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,020
on frighteningly remanufactured ans

288
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,949
what end up happening was large
stakeholders in the industry said well

289
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:19,579
if we use this new technology

290
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,779
on that you are proposing then all of
our technologies are going to become

291
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:24,819
obsolete

292
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,970
and working with the Blues huge amount
of money you know in but you that's not

293
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,090
how we communicated

294
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:32,760
so the you know on anda

295
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,299
and the other the governments
organizations

296
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,889
they you know they lobbied for their
technology saying that their

297
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,240
technologies are better

298
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,120
you know we've been fraction we
manufacture new technologies for

299
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,240
you tens of years now so

300
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,279
so and happening is in the in the on
Real ID Act

301
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:55,330
they do lead all the requirements for

302
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,039
a high-security documents and left in
the way they are now

303
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,799
so you now we have a secure less secure
document

304
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,658
and much about the rules that may or may
not make food system more secure

305
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:14,309
so it's really unfortunate that had
happened

306
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,629
so now have some controversy you can see
that many people

307
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,480
you know don't like this acted all we
have brought Obama totally oppose the

308
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,580
hillary clinton wanted the law be
reviewed you know whatever that means

309
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,210
a.m. you and Mike Huckabee said the wall
was a huge mistake

310
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,549
from ACLU says the real idea it would be
a few the private sector in

311
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:37,629
when they say this to mean that the ID
Act

312
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,139
when the Connor sheen readable
technology that was going to be included

313
00:18:41,139 --> 00:18:42,419
in every ID

314
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,820
could be abused by the private sector in
a way that everywhere you go on every

315
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,789
time the user identification card

316
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,480
all your information to be stories to be
your purchasing had its you know you

317
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,230
whereabouts and you know that people can
start collecting data on you

318
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,760
I'm and they say you know this is a
terrible idea used to be in the end

319
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,158
what they usually say by law I am

320
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,730
and even many conservative groups like
the gun owners of america

321
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,490
oppose the act they say well it's
something like this happens in

322
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,830
felons in other states won't be able to
buy guns in our state's UN

323
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,990
which is probably good for you Mary on

324
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,460
Eliot Spitzer bacteria idea but also
wanted to give

325
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,490
all the units right to vote so he's also
pretty confused

326
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,690
on but he represented a really good
point

327
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,309
he wanted for each driver's licenses
independently from

328
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:39,649
federally issued ID's he wanted to give
all citizens

329
00:19:39,649 --> 00:19:43,279
the right to drive for for secure a

330
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,659
public safety reasons on he said

331
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,059
these two things should be totally
separate and we shouldn't be bringing

332
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,070
together you know this has been a
problem since the beginning of time

333
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:57,559
why we continue in the problem on and
many other states have a doc adopted

334
00:19:57,559 --> 00:19:58,678
that idea as well

335
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,269
maybe in Guinea if begun to give on all

336
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,250
inhabited inhabitants up their states
driver's licenses

337
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,880
although they're not federally
recognized identification cards

338
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,220
so even though they have the right to
drive in those states they don't have

339
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,130
the right

340
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,240
to all the federally mmm

341
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,840
the federal writes that the other
citizens have by having

342
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,970
this enhanced drivers license

343
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,330
so this right this this some

344
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,480
act is was completely unfunded on

345
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,870
and many states are pissed we are you
talk about the commercial issues

346
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,649
and privacy issues and then we have the
public safety issues which

347
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:46,380
many states aren't allowing their legal
in NC drive

348
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,899
which I mean is understandable and this
is a totally other time we know we could

349
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:50,740
talk for

350
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,820
under 12 hours about you know
immigration and legal aliens

351
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,439
on so I made this a

352
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,120
I made this a slide and then I didn't
put a key on it

353
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,460
and then I came back later and Mike had
no idea what a man

354
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,610
so I still know that the gray States
mean

355
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:20,750
and I apologize I you know it half agree
states are actually

356
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,409
I N so we seek we have californian
Alabama like gung-ho you know they're

357
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,399
ready to comply

358
00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:32,860
Real ID Act all the way we have the
yellow states which have actually pass

359
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,179
legislation

360
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:37,539
saying we're not going to comply with
certain parts the REAL ID Act if it

361
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,809
kills us

362
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:42,769
and they're all financial reasons I am

363
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,580
the only state that speaks out against
the fine the old one of the only states

364
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,928
that speaks out

365
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:54,429
against the Real ID Act for its reasons
other than fine of reasons as Utah

366
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,259
and they say you know this is a major

367
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,620
problem on major act against our Privacy

368
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,659
on and therefore using that as your
excuse because they don't have the money

369
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,110
but

370
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:11,159
still there taking a stat for that many
other states were taking

371
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,929
and it may take a few states like North
Dakota Illinois in mind

372
00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:20,049
not the miss you thank you missing in

373
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:25,019
I a yes 0 votes yet all your own

374
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,730
and a based spoken out to get a probably
spoken out against the act but they've

375
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,850
unknowingly began to follow

376
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,149
anyways %um

377
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:40,259
alright snows new more exciting

378
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,940
okay so manufacturing at home

379
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:47,350
we're gonna talk about the need
equipment new serials little bit on

380
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,880
manufacturing processes

381
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,529
an process and he's on the Advanced
Placement it so if you haven't already

382
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:54,789
downloaded this guy

383
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:58,090
recommended you know

384
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,230
its top PDF sorry an

385
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,610
and what I'm doing them to do the most
simple lists ID reproduction method

386
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,269
that I have listened to guide and it's
the quickest

387
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,799
and easiest reproduces and I wanna go to
other methods as well

388
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,149
them are much more expensive ands

389
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,289
you know if you have questions about
that we can talk about those

390
00:23:24,289 --> 00:23:29,639
in 11 or later the email have you choose

391
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:34,880
so why manufactured home you can produce
high-quality documents for your

392
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,389
organization's bob is a club you can
predict protect your privacy

393
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:41,880
you're creating another identification
which is not a legal

394
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,330
I am you know if you want to start small
identification cards

395
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,389
car manufacturing consulting business
which is something that

396
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:53,340
I've kinda taking the path a on

397
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,668
and then you can produce other call the
document to the exact same techniques

398
00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:02,539
for the fraction the cost on if you were
to produce some would argue something

399
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:03,980
about the show you through on

400
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,110
for it through another retailer repaying
you know

401
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:11,139
upwards to ten dollars a document we're
gonna make them for like

402
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:15,159
fifty cents a document you know so this
is just easy to do and it's a lot of fun

403
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,460
it's really interesting

404
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,129
you know I'm totally obsessed with it

405
00:24:20,129 --> 00:24:23,879
so obviously he should never produce
toxins there somewhere government

406
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,299
documents

407
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,730
ans I am

408
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:36,730
for example or so you picture

409
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:44,090
this is my driver's license yeah

410
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:49,559
and this is my membership card for locks
were international

411
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:54,769
and use many differences between the two
cards

412
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:59,190
but you can see

413
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,049
been on there's enough differences
between these two cards

414
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,399
that I would never get in trouble

415
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,389
you for having a a document that looks
like an

416
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:16,610
a government IQ so

417
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:23,610
so what you need a compatible Skeena
compatibility chip printer

418
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,159
I am laminator a die cutter

419
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,389
which we see here in West you can see
them

420
00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:37,490
pro-u_s_ you know what's going on arm

421
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:40,809
and magnetic stripe encoder for
incurring the stripe

422
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,710
on the back of the card if you choose to
use that technology on

423
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,159
customer stance FreePBX reproducing the
hologram

424
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,080
a black-white for admiring your work at
the end

425
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,080
in the scanner for scanning images or

426
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,570
you know making your personal them
template

427
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,570
a signature pad for writing signatures
directly to the card

428
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,100
Photoshop of course and all this

429
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,559
all this material most this material can
be

430
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:12,789
pursued brainstorm ideas if I dot com
this is my favorite

431
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:16,669
site where purges most nights materials
from

432
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:21,769
and then

433
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:25,869
those rats that was all the equipment
materials will talk about

434
00:26:25,869 --> 00:26:29,450
or more detail the ways our test line
now this is synthetic paper

435
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,149
it's called Hall effin it's a very
porous

436
00:26:33,149 --> 00:26:36,629
plastic papered I'm I have some appear
just

437
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:40,749
looks like my paper but its very fake
its opaque on

438
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:44,399
and it's also its personal facts
biodegradable

439
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:50,109
on any apps it has superior adhesion
qualities we makin

440
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:54,799
a he's to the whammy material non-normal

441
00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:01,249
normal-weight laser paper or on no stock
paper does not he swam in it

442
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:05,799
and this material he's directly to the
planet and that's what makes it superior

443
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:09,609
this application we have Pro X pigment
powders switcher

444
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:13,389
perfect for making holograms and

445
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:16,840
what this material what this powder does
is that at an angle

446
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:21,279
you can see the you can see the powder
but when you look strictly on so you can

447
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,249
see the re:

448
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:28,720
so it's perfect for holograms right side
is disabled

449
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,220
and that's why I included the site
owners

450
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,720
from you know just directly below it and
he did give permission

451
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,330
so releases email address so he might
take like three or four months to get

452
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,059
back to you

453
00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:47,639
but it's really the only place you can
buy was a quick minute

454
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:52,809
a lot of this materials that so in the
actual guide

455
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:58,789
it has ornette his and his website next
to each individual material

456
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:02,149
so you know where you know where
everything is from

457
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:07,629
and transparent base now when we're
making the actual

458
00:28:07,629 --> 00:28:11,109
on holographic

459
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:14,119
outweigh remix transfer a base which

460
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,220
with the Pro it's been a powder and your
throat temperament do that

461
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,940
in a minute show you how it's done and
then we apply that to stamp it stamp it

462
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,919
directly to the

463
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:27,009
an test material with the pre-printed

464
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:32,609
I D face on it tsunami go through the
process

465
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:37,369
fume when it turned on house lights on
from the

466
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:42,169
you go through this

467
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:48,259
as quickly as possible thank you

468
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:55,259
so

469
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:03,430
what I do they take a shiny surface I
have for so I have my

470
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:06,580
pre-printed template out now in the guy

471
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,610
explains exactly how I pre my template

472
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:15,350
on Westar as I have eight cars on the
single sheet ans

473
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,420
on the back to have the back pre-printed
as well and the back of the card has

474
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:25,010
like our mission statement ans on like
the website over member clubs I'm

475
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,480
there's also room in the back

476
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,200
so we can use the this material here

477
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,560
this material is actually on magnetic
stripe

478
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,720
thats that spree in embedded

479
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,690
into the land and this can be but it
brings from my displayed a calm as well

480
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:46,220
and I have its own it's all lined up a
look like this

481
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,600
and when it's die cut out afterwards ill
come out perfectly

482
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,950
I'm say you know when you're making your
own template you have so I take all this

483
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,370
stuff into consideration

484
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:58,400
and you will take many many hours have

485
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,310
printing in your reconfiguring the if
you can manage to do it all in all comes

486
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,760
out well you'll be very happy

487
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,580
so wanna do as I get a shiny surface are
usually use a piece aluminum foil amuses

488
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,169
pieces

489
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:14,400
ten dollar women instead I don't have
anyone for him

490
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,360
on this

491
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,810
kinda looks like drugs but its actually
the pigment powder

492
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:27,370
and silica

493
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:32,530
you can see that little good

494
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:39,530
a true Graham our mmm get this is the
Pearl Ex to powder

495
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,370
it's very shiny stuff in its all over
your hands in your lungs

496
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,980
sa recommend

497
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,230
wearing respirator in Euros actually
flying everywhere cuz theres

498
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,930
area active on stage you and see a
little bit on

499
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,950
table there as well now I take some the
the

500
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:04,090
this is it's called glazing medium

501
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,050
on really all you need is a transparent
base acrylic water base

502
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:16,050
any type material you might have to
experiment around with that

503
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:23,920
looks like a never opened this before
sorry am going to drop like

504
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,530
12 you three you know

505
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,629
informers on the table and I take my
finger

506
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,110
you get messy and I

507
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:39,210
mix it up like produce pretty fast
because the stuff will drive fasten the

508
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:39,679
air

509
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,990
you can only really make like three
whole years the first half tries

510
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,410
price for it out

511
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,530
alter or Tristan now the main problem
that new

512
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,840
hologram acres due Tuesday don't spread
of enough

513
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,230
and they get like huge globs holograms
on their new ID's

514
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,500
and doesn't look very authentic 0

515
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,990
so

516
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,890
I'm at stake this stamp right here it
says

517
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:14,450
Loch sport international on across

518
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,830
in letters or custom CNN and I stamped
sheet

519
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:23,240
very lightly and I apply its

520
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,350
to the car that I wanna play the whole
game too

521
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,060
okay now

522
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,510
it's very very light

523
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,379
and when you apply the laminate you can
see a better now if you turn white house

524
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:38,950
lights off

525
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,950
show you

526
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,820
no can return the well this is lighter

527
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:09,850
you know

528
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,070
you see it

529
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,740
well

530
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:23,740
I means like those older

531
00:33:24,249 --> 00:33:27,110
can we try that and come out issues I
want you so much for your time

532
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:34,110
seats are you need to dry

533
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Springer

534
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:52,919
thank you

535
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,320
and we can see this is the you keeping
their powder

536
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,570
lights up real well with the or by Clyde
on

537
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,230
and then if I find my driver's license

538
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:10,310
and my a membership card I can show you

539
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:17,310
area so there's my

540
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:22,960
membership card I made earlier and you
can see it slides a very well right

541
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,560
and this is my Texas driver's license
which doesn't perform nearly as well as

542
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,179
mine

543
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:32,280
but if you go to the airport

544
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,050
and the you know the first thing they do
is they put your driver's license and

545
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,899
the bikeway

546
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:40,489
and they've all been strained assists
tell you know black-white

547
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:43,619
on security features above all else

548
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,550
and by quite you know UV lights a key
features are usually the easiest to

549
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,369
reproduce

550
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:55,179
unfortunately on so I have the stance
and the stance 18 from Simon stamped are

551
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,530
common in Canada

552
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,460
which is prolly a reason why I was able
to attain an on

553
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,780
the others when I try to obtain stance
from from

554
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:11,780
there sources much I have seen since
from other sources the

555
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:15,470
you like in the US I gotten any messages
back and said Well

556
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,420
these represent US hologram images from
various states

557
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,619
when I can be a reprint we're not immune
to make the stands for you

558
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:26,300
simon's its and bits in the

559
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,550
on guy but it's called sign in stamps
dot com

560
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,329
sign and stamp dot com and they let you
produce

561
00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:37,490
all types have on graphic images and
things like that

562
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:42,560
so

563
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,270
next step in the process would be to
place your laminate on identification

564
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,130
card

565
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,660
template sheet that you are reproduced
you have your hologram

566
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,410
priest on every single identification
card and you have your back mean it like

567
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,359
we show here

568
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:00,380
which I have mmm I'm using mag stripe

569
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,270
so I can add that extra security future

570
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,810
on then I would use this piece

571
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:11,470
love and I have all the outlines for the

572
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,630
sizes and thicknesses appointments to
use at a piece of other women that I put

573
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,220
on site

574
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:20,670
you know may produce through the
laminator and we try for a few minutes

575
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:24,460
and then the next I would be to scuttle
doubt on the actual die cutter

576
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,329
you can buy several different types of
die cutters on the internet with

577
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:29,420
different sizes

578
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,440
depending on your application an

579
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,849
the Dyker chose to bring today is much
bigger than any

580
00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:41,210
US drivers license not to confuse

581
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,000
you my intentions where so I brought
need a bigger one

582
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,220
so and the Tigers Mike a five hundred
dollar piece of equipment but its

583
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,250
it weighs about forty pounds per year me
like 30 pounds like pretty heavy it's

584
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,119
pretty awesome

585
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,030
I'm it's really satisfying you pull down
this letter in Lake

586
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,210
crinkles through the test moon landing
it's like really a

587
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:06,160
good feeling I'm gonna cut out I'm gonna
cut out a

588
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,700
and identification card from a pre
laminated said

589
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,530
have ID's they have here and show you
how it's done

590
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:20,530
you know the house lights yes

591
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,730
9 extracts the magnetic strips will read

592
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:31,119
they are fully writeable on three
different tracks

593
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:38,119
with the proper equipment on

594
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:45,990
well

595
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,330
hypothetically you could take your real
drivers license

596
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:55,000
and copy it over to you identification
card

597
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:02,000
and use that as a membership card

598
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,530
so

599
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,990
up

600
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,770
area I'll see rain is backwards

601
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,850
so I usually I have the

602
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,830
this is a laminated mmm free laminated

603
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:31,740
acquitted in Asia you from the back

604
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:37,110
it's easier to see but now i cant see
anything so

605
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:44,110
one everything up by sight

606
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:48,290
it's at me like six months to get really
good at this

607
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:55,290
now I can be like 100 cards in like 10
minutes

608
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,920
on everybody here this been

609
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,960
them the alright your

610
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:50,950
I it so that's a

611
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:57,670
you can see the Loch sport logo that
runs across the side

612
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:01,690
and the back is the perfectly aligned
max right

613
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:08,190
on with our membership creed and this
will go directly into

614
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:12,270
nex-7 cutter on some other things as
well

615
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,320
touch on are this is that he serve

616
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:23,320
photo easy we can see this is a piece of
photo easy

617
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:27,710
on it's just for making screens sooner
we have making holograms

618
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,760
and you make use the transparency

619
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,870
says lots for national reproductive sign
you can plot

620
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:38,020
the a transparent like screening
material in a

621
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,060
makes up for election the powder in
their interest rub it on

622
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,320
the entire on the entire

623
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,180
printer template on okay I guess

624
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:58,180
I think that's it for the demonstration
for now so

625
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,300
so this is a picture in Photoshop what
ok

626
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:14,300
them X is a picture above what

627
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:17,500
you know the template looks like before
Prince on Photoshop you see

628
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,390
I have like the guides no wind at home
you wanna each already made template

629
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:21,960
file

630
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,780
on the computer for Prince on

631
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,000
this is it's just something i wanna
touch on Scotty out Springer

632
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,990
and this is for this is how you make
really high quality professional he

633
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,010
identification card image holograms

634
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:40,020
and what you do is used spread out an
even layer

635
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,740
Pearl Ex powder onto a piece a planet
onto the

636
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,780
those two sides on it is a silent it has

637
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,880
the on

638
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,150
to call he said thank you

639
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,310
pesticide has the adhesive on it any put
put even wear pearl XP

640
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,590
Pro X powder on the adhesive side and
pretty in this printer

641
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,440
in a printer what it does is it seals in
a

642
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,290
the Pearl Ex powder in the areas or that
you want the

643
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,850
hologram and only you can you take the
when it added printing you wash off

644
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:18,680
on the excess on Pearl Ex

645
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,290
ans what you have left is a perfect
hologram

646
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,720
and sprinter they don't make em anymore
you can find many Bay

647
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,460
about eight hundred dollars and usually
they come in and work

648
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,390
you have to buy new no one will come
into work

649
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:39,680
and you'll sell it back on eBay and then
up

650
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,230
but its it's a terrible process night

651
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,860
you wrap it up here on

652
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,250
so some futuristic concepts and designs
a PVC is being faced by test limits the

653
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,480
policy we talked about

654
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,080
on Harvin's are you face but he knew
grams which are like

655
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,759
on much more high-tech holograms you
know we have like

656
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,750
several different images in one hologram
on

657
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,810
some you see them unlike the backup
phone batteries and stuff like that

658
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:12,820
I'm one deep in place by 2d 3d

659
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:18,200
not sure what it is and single call you
vis-a-vis

660
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,440
place by Falko UV and Mike what I showed
you was a single call you the butt

661
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,150
if you have a printer that you can
replace the in the print cartridges and

662
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:28,620
you get several different types of you
keeping their powder

663
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,529
you can make your own in together and
reject the into the printer cartridge

664
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,780
and have a full color UV printer and you
can print directly onto the fast lane

665
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,070
with this type

666
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,310
prayer and you know refilling ink
cartridges is something that

667
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,950
you many view prolly explored with on so
you can reproduce this pretty easily

668
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,120
whose goal it in iris print which are
coach in security lines you know

669
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,680
they make the geology really unique
ended and when you try to

670
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,080
on and scan these images usually comes
up pretty bad

671
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,560
and then I restraint is when the colours
gradually change in a way

672
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,270
that is impossible to reproduce on norm
a.m.

673
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:12,230
like residential printers on some other
pretty cool stuff is hidden images that

674
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,540
are

675
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,800
only deal with decoding ones is that you
on

676
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,450
that are available only to by government
agencies and things like that

677
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,770
and you see on the left there's the
picture of the black image to the

678
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,400
decoding when the turns red and has a
special design

679
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,450
Ardsley very able Inc which is some
words the Pearl Ex material

680
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:35,120
on any changes colors angles

681
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,370
there's in for reading which is nothing
new

682
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,810
I so if you have a credit card you can
take it out and see it

683
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:46,770
prolly a different color the nynex first
other something other than black for his

684
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:47,820
name printed on Mike

685
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,240
ultra secure like american express or
something it's like

686
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,700
you like the blue Americans press cards
that have on

687
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,040
a blue max

688
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,640
an extra day you know they can for their
logos and stuff on there

689
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,259
and as my critics was also isn't new but
is

690
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,420
also extremely hard to replicate

691
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,670
so then there's the

692
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,730
the police single cause thing that i'd
ever discovered in IT industry

693
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,790
on when I was discovering this a
technology just talking to someone in

694
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:22,550
the industry

695
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:26,390
on and I stallion the reason my 17 year

696
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,960
on the first page is cuz when I was %um
talk on people talk with you I said you

697
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,880
know mines dome

698
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:35,220
from the University of Texas I'm doing a
project we're doing independent study

699
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,000
group

700
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,730
identification card security he said oh
yeah would you are you getting funding

701
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,360
from University a kind

702
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,100
you know he said well them you know you
know what I do is I A

703
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,870
I fractionally make ID cards for the
government's

704
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:56,029
and test them out you know I have like
the license to kill for me

705
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,860
UDID industry kinda so that's like the
coolest thing ever heard

706
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:03,730
you take internships

707
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:07,040
so we talked for like an hour in East
tell me that laser engraving

708
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,630
and the stars and not sorry about that
maybe sources tell me

709
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,840
he's like the house had it how they make
figure he's in Texas somehow I don't

710
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,820
know anything about that

711
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:21,290
and he says on ok money from your
friends and stuff my maybe he's like

712
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:24,390
bikini certainly will you know what I do
and what do you do

713
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:29,000
is like research time that how he takes
the laminate of the identification card

714
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,590
in new places the picture

715
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:33,950
he changed the birthdate know this is
pretty confident in what you cannot do

716
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:34,880
this

717
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,250
on but you know this I mean it's
something I've always had trouble with

718
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:44,610
but thinking about soldiers have a fever
and

719
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:49,100
and he and he starts I was like wow if
you go to Walmart and get the SPECIAL

720
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:52,480
solvents on the shelf knew what the card
said on the show is told in the name the

721
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,710
solvent

722
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:57,370
begins the AM I can remember in

723
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:02,630
with yeah that would you say me that is
metal hopefully tone

724
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,660
you met for the key to negate that
sounds very familiar up

725
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:11,109
okay type

726
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:14,540
right that sense about right

727
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,410
I and useless the ID sittin there for a
while he's Tonio stuff my

728
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,460
writing it all down much this is awesome
and

729
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,710
he saw me you know then I the secret to
the whole partner Mike

730
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,300
you know is to is this is the painter is
the

731
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:33,520
glue that I used to put the down he's
back on

732
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,910
you know women after changed everything
to he's limit back to the test soon

733
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:38,270
afterwards

734
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:41,509
and I'm like no you are you told me the
secret you know I know how to put the

735
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,140
money back on the ID

736
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,080
on and you like because like a pause
he's like wait a minute

737

739
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,660
thank you um so like a pause knees like

740
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,819
psych we speaking and at this point I
was speaking at Def Con only I wasn't

741
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:09,990
approved speak here yet and he s so that
sounds like members

742
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:13,030
hardcore political activists conferences

743
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,390
I said yeah that sounds about right

744
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:20,970
said I have to go I said makes you time

745
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:24,100
I am anyways so this guy that's it. he

746
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,440
represents this company in the do laser
engraving the

747
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,150
it's something a polycarbonate laser
engraving I am

748
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:37,150
only license for government use and
involves is just kinda like see burning

749
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,980
in a way that it comes down unit it like
in grades

750
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,050
into three different layers on the
polycarbonate material

751
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:47,410
and I'm its tolley tamper-proof

752
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,520
its on its the future %uh verification
card security

753
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,180
its you know extremely high-resolution
an

754
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,419
I'm like in the previous slide

755
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,150
it has a GPS of the strike system me
know if it's taken away from that

756
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,830
the place that was released from within
like 20 meters the circuits for frying a

757
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,509
laser or self-destruct

758
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:13,290
which is pretty awesome on its only
government organizations

759
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:16,870
only topple the government organizations
unique your local TV

760
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,950
yes I was can not have it you know it
has to be at state level has to be

761
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:24,390
you know armed guards that can only be
open mic there's all these lists that

762
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:25,500
the government you know

763
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,550
ways out although it's I asked me if I
could have a copy of something

764
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,690
polycarbonate

765
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,850
he said well we keep those in a

766
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:36,480
only two different states around the
world in one min not United States so it

767
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,270
has to get

768
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:44,270
summer approval from the university or
something it's okay I can set that up

769
00:49:44,380 --> 00:49:46,030
and this is the last slide it's

770
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:49,380
want me future is going to gauge heard
hopefully will look like

771
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,760
if they've read the provisions in the
Real ID Act we have

772
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,220
a magnetic stripe bikini Graham a bar 3d
Barca a 2d barcode

773
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,940
laser engraving full color UV imaging on

774
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,060
we have to we have black and white
graphics

775
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,570
and full-color graphics and colleague
polycarbonate which I have

776
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,480
Polycarp I have some polycarbonate
material which is not use for

777
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,550
on making laser engraving they do have
some party come into a cost like 15 or

778
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,130
20 dollars per sheet

779
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,340
on so it's though the government
considers the most tamper-proof material

780
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:28,660
and in conclusion we have ID cards been
around a hundred years

781
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:33,000
on we have valid reasons to want to
deploy and

782
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,310
increase concerns and we mean
immigration on you can become the a

783
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,470
involved in the IT security industry at
home ans

784
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,290
of course all ID cards have strengths
and weaknesses but hopefully emerging

785
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,130
technologies

786
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,450
will deliver robust identification
system if implemented correctly

787
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:55,450
so may keep were over so we don't really
have time

788
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,660
i'm for questions so if you just wanna
approach dog

789
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:13,660
that should work just you thanks for
coming this week

790
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:28,900
are just a reminder is everybody leaves
one water bottle or

791
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:32,470
one plastic cup on the ground it kinda
looks like crap by the end of the day
