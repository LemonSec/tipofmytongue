1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,280
by the hallway again as for the that's
for the unscheduled tracks a few wanna

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,320
say something on your own

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,629
I mean look as activities downstairs
like we're talking about please don't

4
00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:10,070
turn off the hotel TV's

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,230
a in that lobby I know it's it's
tempting

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,880
I think we've had like takeover in any
way to help them out this but the

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,220
hotel's been great to us

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,500
and we're glad that it still standing I
think

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,700
to ensure they keep standing was treated
with respect

10
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,790
the respect it deserves and I'm who
knows what the future will hold so on

11
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,390
Soria might give the official entrant um

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,230
it come a little better prepare their

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,100
are you guys ready to go okay thought
your only day to give the round of

14
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:42,679
applause

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:49,679
well I we have a special that's about
cell phone so we have cell phone jammers

16
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:53,739
appear so

17
00:00:53,739 --> 00:00:59,399
it yeah it actually doesn't matter so

18
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:06,399
sorry can't wear use or sell for now all
rights lol

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,219
ultra an assist for free a

20
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:14,490
little bit about us before we get
started the so you know what your

21
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,829
which are in store for I'm senior editor

22
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:24,829
Make Magazine you guys are make okay
because the way people though it always

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,530
ask for

24
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,719
now around almost four years we have a
hundred twenty-five thousand

25
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:34,439
circulation 45,000 subscribers on a
website as a lot people visit

26
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,609
scrapers there's use community people
building things and sending

27
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:44,130
their projects to us now I our Maker
Faire that we do every year

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,140
is up to 65,000 people so it's

29
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,359
giant event in San Francisco we'll send
you one and Austin

30
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:55,100
and here's up some other things that
we've been up to make see some other

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,420
covers were quarterly so comes out

32
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,729
every few months three branches in the
craft for people who like to do more

33
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:08,709
the softer side literally acting and
then

34
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:11,930
I we decided that well what other we're

35
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,900
we're thinking we do so we have Japanese
version which is kinda taking off

36
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,000
which is great and I actually like it. I
can't really read Japanese

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,700
but it looks cooler Japanese

38
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,860
and and that this is

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,750
more her business they differed yep so
you could probably just like

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,409
its risk Ford so two years ago

41
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,340
a I talked about the wave up a project
this is an open source

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,700
RF jammer which is actually if you look
at counts like this

43
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,900
as is the beta and basically you know i
i just been releasing open source

44
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,680
hardware

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,260
electronic kits basically more soldering

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,310
microcontroller programming firmware
analog/digital

47
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,879
a that kinda stuff because I think
that's an interesting and I found that a

48
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:57,679
lot of people also interested

49
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,069
in building the sort of technologies
especially technologies are legal

50
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:04,540
for example it's illegal to own use
operates L

51
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,328
a cell phone jammer so I'm you can buy
them but

52
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:11,840
there's a chance at the stores will be
shut down boats cool is that

53
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,430
if you know a little bit harder love the
soldering you can create your own cell

54
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,109
phone jammer using parts from Mouser
digikey

55
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:21,900
us a flick on cars parts you can build
your own so then there's no way to stop

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,120
people from buying these components
kisser just

57
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,340
everyday Electronix that's what I like
it's create something interesting from

58
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,609
stuff you find around you cell

59
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,269
our this was an account %ah you know
when they're driving and their

60
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:42,069
talking and there swerving all over cell

61
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,489
I and you know what it's not even think
acid resin like a watch how you mustn't

62
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:47,290
de personne

63
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,698
units prolly get off the phone like
you're not supposed to come far and he's

64
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:51,569
like I whatever

65
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,280
and then so if there's a lot of hello
can you hear me now here in a

66
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,400
this an action shot you guys will enjoy
this year is visiting

67
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,269
the cap situation may be able to stop
sons and other projects in a years ago

68
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:11,090
sleeping movies oxide it said open
source cheesy

69
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,099
303 clowns that set synthesizer from

70
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,180
at twenty years ago more 394 that was

71
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,539
a discontinued by Roland Japan I love
people still want these

72
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,240
synthesizer boxes so a friend of mine
and I

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,130
in when I was in college decided hey
let's reverse engineering and because no

74
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,719
pants valid anymore it has been more
than 20 years let's make a clone

75
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:37,370
that again you can build using
off-the-shelf parts and you can make

76
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:37,900
this

77
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,020
to the size is no longer available does
what she does not need a

78
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,789
you can build your own for 200 suck and
here's some

79
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:49,900
you blink you like kids just want to
show a couple projects cc

80
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,240
we're coming from this is a LED

81
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,520
bicycle wheel animation kids so you can

82
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,650
make it pac-man when you like like and I
also

83
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,270
did some so that small educational kids
is the many pockets just

84
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:09,520
video persist division toys for like
under

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,680
seventeen dollars and I like the idea of
low-cost

86
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,750
introductory electronics so when you
leave its bills

87
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,969
so what's cool is that the tall man
who's giving the top

88
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,979
after this he should definitely stuff
stay for she said well you know I want

89
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,310
to build is bring sheen which is thing
that makes you trip

90
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,389
Anna I didn't work for me but like he's
he's not how the seventies he can

91
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:32,229
explain it %um sure you well

92
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:35,830
in an hour and he took this mini pocket
and he modified it

93
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,229
and he even gives workshops down I think
he's doing a workshop either today or

94
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,639
tomorrow on how to build these

95
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,270
using the many pockets at school a and
this is a

96
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,820
out to extend mp3 charger so it's
another

97
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,050
small educational kit am and this is a

98
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,229
another thing I worked with Mitch Altman
on he invented the TV on

99
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,139
is a little remote control a contract
TV's the following the TV gone is

100
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:58,729
although it's

101
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,210
its awesome and it turns off many TVs
only works up to like thirty feet

102
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,760
which is totally not enough so we worked
together

103
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,520
to build a version that you got to 200
feet and and

104
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,630
yeah this one %uh made its debut at CES
I don't know if you

105
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,779
saw to commodity

106
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,380
it's good it has exploreli diseases like
wide and narrow

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,740
and its cool is that there's a community
in the form of people who are modifying

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,460
skip to like force not enough money

109
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:30,659
eighty LED's any to 6 volt battery pack
I need to be attached to Mike

110
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:34,000
captain so everyone look TV's turn off
there's

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,430
harkin modification love you know these
existing technologies and because it's

112
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,060
all open source is still like

113
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,060
I have to understand that shipping isn't
extract

114
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,300
firmware and use acid to take the dye
out now it's all open source

115
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,330
it's easy to hack its you know
kick-start so you just go in and say

116
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,200
L you know how to connect LED so I just
Adam on that's it

117
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,440
okay cool this is hacked I can do and if
you're younger this will get you started

118
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,669
so you can continue on to more advanced
and a few lately I've been working on

119
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,849
Arduino based projects and open source
my controller platform says is a

120
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:12,089
DIY GPS logger and tracker so

121
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:16,019
India maybe next over the next
conference we go to will talk about some

122
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,289
the projects are doing with that

123
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:21,140
how many people here know about are
green our player yeah

124
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,719
laugh a lot so that number every time
her out it was like 60 before was like

125
00:07:25,719 --> 00:07:26,419
one guy was like

126
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:30,560
we know K

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,690
so lowering it be talking about today is
a new kid is a SIM card reader kit

128
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,370
so I don't actually own a cell phone so
on a cell phone jamming other compatible

129
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,570
but I think it's interesting that you
know a couple years ago maybe ten years

130
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,310
ago everyone was like million to reading
next rapes

131
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,070
but nowadays we don't really get me now
there's actually a RFID style

132
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,979
cards but it's interesting that I never
actually learned about SIM cards and

133
00:07:55,979 --> 00:07:56,690
even other in

134
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:01,349
almost every phone I and technology
behind Sanford is really interesting

135
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,140
but on if we should try to find online
was really kind of archaic it's actually

136
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,570
beautiful

137
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,830
me understand so wanted and build
something that even though this is sorta

138
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,149
all the technology that makes it really
easy

139
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,430
and straightforward to understand House
Inc artwork and why they're secure and

140
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,029
how to crack that security

141
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:23,039
and one other thing that this is a

142
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,260
project we worked together as we decided
to start a laser etching

143
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,640
business and open source lazer tube is a
new york city so we got this laser is

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,870
twenty thousand dollars

145
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,899
and we paid off in about six months and
what we're doing is

146
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,089
laser etching laptop so if you see
laptops around we act these

147
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:42,700
I'm so we take perfectly good max and
void the warranty is and people pay if

148
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,120
up

149
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,430
configure Steve Jobs nightmare we also
tried to do other things like this is

150
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:47,810
fair

151
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,130
we put CC instructions santori so

152
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,710
we actually we put spaces a people we
don't like on tortillas and then we eat

153
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,210
them

154
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,780
and it's like a weird like a laser
etching

155
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,319
Millennials who do so I we put all this
information out

156
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,210
and is around 20 laser shops and open
since we did this little files

157
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:07,690
everything

158
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,490
but mostly because we retired people
emailing us saying no

159
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,890
I can't come to new york city can I send
you something you don't want people

160
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,660
senator

161
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,870
their laptops so now people and all
parts %uh the world

162
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,310
are starting their own laser getting
businesses okay so the intra

163
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,680
but the rest is is going to be a lot
faster so two years ago we came here and

164
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,380
we did talk on service engineer

165
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,990
where we we actually did a full talk
about that's the stuff this reemergence

166
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,340
of hardware technology

167
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,000
something new era love packing in
freaking and take a dollar to video made

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,260
by accessing its online she have seen
how much people have it

169
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,840
but what we what we thought about so
we've been going to this conference for

170
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,980
like 10 years have been

171
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,750
I enter the first up I want to be on
hold but I think that was about ten

172
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,390
years ago

173
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,830
and another thing we know is we look at
some the speakers here is

174
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,390
I think there's a lot of people are talk
about this is the last hope

175
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,930
and theirs is understanding or at least
a feeling that

176
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,330
the hacking see as we knew it in the
nineties and if you're

177
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:10,200
17 maybe you don't remember this but is
kinda dead

178
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,270
but not like a bad way like oh my god I
have tragic it was on its deathbed

179
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,280
we get oxygen but couldn't make it but
there's definitely been a transition

180
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,329
from this early hopes you know

181
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:28,270
1994 to 2002 2002-2008 up

182
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,960
and there's also a lotta histology you
know these conferences

183
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,290
are filled with things from Lee blocks
red boxes

184
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:39,420
splits buffers IRC I text files

185
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,640
truck jerks getting kicked out of
construct I'm always something you're

186
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,600
such about some other things that happen
in like the nineties acting that you

187
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,110
liked

188
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,650
life's China's stuff yeah

189
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:55,449
yeah significant yes if that's very
passe

190
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,840
yeah and actually and will say pretty
soon it would have been the worst thing

191
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,520
we could possibly done probably in the
late 90's but now it's like

192
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,660
ok all like now it's fun so it's
interesting times to change

193
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,699
%uh so now

194
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,870
there's other things so instead of doing
things that we all used to do

195
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,240
now there's white papers everyone
security consultants doing

196
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,290
had testing they have put deals urs wait
there's

197
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,420
a boondoggles yeah

198
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,839
the car to the word out they were dried
its its kinda this

199
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,590
new old and

200
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:33,940
so we notice was that as some things and
some things began

201
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,620
hardware start based on number people
here

202
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,400
new Barbie no that's a lot two years and
people are

203
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,600
buying markets makers things that

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,870
working on for a while we can't seem to
keep up with demand

205
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,010
more and more people wanting to do are
greater than ever before

206
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:54,760
so upset is an engineer

207
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,250
is something that we put together we
wanted to look for

208
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,880
not back but we also want to build on
the past so

209
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,910
I we like the idea the entire just
technologies

210
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,689
that got us all here up and we think
they're still

211
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,100
interesting but what we wanted to do is
pull it all together

212
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,120
and show it maybe in a modern way so I
made a video

213
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,160
and its core kind like a short film we
just

214
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,490
debuted its like a few minutes ago on
the web and we're gonna show you on some

215
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,870
snippets I its again always be
non-commercial not sponsor we're gonna

216
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,650
try to do these is often as we can

217
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,069
I it's only for people like all of us
here

218
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,090
we don't think anyone else is gonna like
it kinda hope they don't

219
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,190
either I will say so

220
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,640
a stood but the the introduction yeah

221
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,180
one other things that we wanted to do to
is a a lot of good

222
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,200
things that lamar's worked on she made
his office box so people

223
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,080
take them used take the Sox box and then
make interesting music so we wanted to

224
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,930
use that as our soundtrack so now we've
got a bunch of commuting

225
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,980
there's also artists are using
processing which is part A

226
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,260
the Arduino develop an environment
similar ID

227
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,100
they do interesting art sale we talk to
an artist who

228
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,460
does really interesting art with
processing so I this introduction and

229
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:11,920
we're gonna

230
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,850
show you some some other snippets so out
yeah picking at the house lights off

231
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:20,230
from now Ford that would be great

232
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:27,230
I don't know if anyone has access okay

233
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,510
issue

234
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:46,510
yeah pretty loudest think

235
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,980
list

236
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,800
past

237
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,800
times okay

238
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,000
so that's our checks now we're gonna do
is skip ahead

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,380
sue the first part so what we did is we
talked about GSM phones

240
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,470
SIM cards all that stuff you can
download the video later

241
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,440
up and him what we do is kinda demystify
sum up what goes on behind the scenes

242
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,380
with electronics

243
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,420
so up we took part store

244
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,250
evolve the up things that you'll you'll
need

245
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,050
should so basically this first project
is

246
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,560
you know every GSM phone at the sim card
in it and

247
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,959
such a lovely few things going on in SIM
card love the stuff actually

248
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,579
explore back in 98 suing eagleberger
cracks the comp

249
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:00,860
128 31 encryption scheme basically an

250
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,430
love cool data that stored in SIM cards
even today

251
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:08,350
for example at the last 10 phone numbers
dialed from the phone even if you've

252
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,860
deleted your call history

253
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:14,040
and sometimes sentence he just misses
are still stored so

254
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,120
even you know it interestingly enough
even know SIM card cloning was only

255
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,170
really popular in the late 90's

256
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,149
if became popular again because that was
hell I sons were originally

257
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:29,079
cracked was to duplicate samples but
changeable for the information she could

258
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,120
use a different character than AT&T cell

259
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,230
but unfortunately I looked online for
some information

260
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,690
all that was very focused on just either
forensic psych really hardcore friends

261
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,560
its information

262
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,889
or basically how to hack iPhone so I
wanted to sort

263
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,880
create a more generalized introduction
two SIM cards and Heather

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,630
read that data SIM card doesn't do that
by at building a very very inexpensive

265
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,170
a SIM card reader and show how to do
that in your own home and then one

266
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:59,310
the free and open source software on
your computer as for this fight for you

267
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,329
can sort of the house lights

268
00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:03,740
that's okay so

269
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,759
film which will set up here got my
multimeter commuter

270
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,300
will be used for testing circuit the few

271
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,740
sector which will be used to get rid of
all the fumes soldering

272
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,949
and my soldering iron I also have a

273
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,779
next vice holding the circuit board like
work on it this is really useful

274
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,060
you can use third there's three parts

275
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,300
%uh SIM card reader there's the power
supply section

276
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,860
there's the oscillator section and then
there's the serial port and scarred

277
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,120
interface section so

278
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,189
for the power supply need and I know
battery

279
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:42,490
older will connect the battery at this
for

280
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:45,870
a one in 4001

281
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,269
protection diode and 7805

282
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:52,449
send me if I was coming to righties mini
version

283
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:57,189
Big Brother version you can use either
one the power supply should also have an

284
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:59,389
LED to indicate when the device is on

285
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:03,149
so an LED and the 1k resistor and then

286
00:17:03,149 --> 00:17:06,459
to keep the power supply functioning
well

287
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,839
a bypass capaz passers necessary this
one is a

288
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:14,579
100 micro farad capacitor and this is a
small ceramic

289
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:17,658
second part of the circuit that we're
gonna build see also section

290
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:21,150
that's the part that generates 3.57
megahertz signal

291
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,079
sent to the SIM card that lets it when
it cracked pottery ily

292
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,230
3.57 megahertz crystal to

293
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,409
20 pick up Eric passes earth in one make
your own

294
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:36,780
resistor 2k resistor and a 74 HC

295
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,889
04 not gay you can also

296
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,870
get a socket at the gate into X the
third part

297
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,770
over the circuitry is this your port and
SIM card interface

298
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,650
the most important part here is to get a
good SIM card holder this allows you to

299
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,970
but the SIM card and block it so you can
create

300
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,460
a good connection with it and a female
db9

301
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,250
serial port connector this is what
you'll be able to connect the computer

302
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,419
also need to zener diodes

303
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,000
anywhere between 3.6 26 balls perfectly
fine

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,980
and three 10k resistors this part is
what allows a

305
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,460
10 votes to report to contact with if I
volts and card reader

306
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,149
safely also any NPN transistor

307
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:30,020
any SIM card has a bunch of contacts on
the bottom that allows the SIM card

308
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:30,549
reader

309
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:35,120
talk to it now there's eight or nine or
10 contacts here

310
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,559
but only six little ones are really
important the SIM card looks like on the

311
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:42,510
bottom now there's a sex contacts

312
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,480
in the middle there's one one big
contact and that when they contacted

313
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,970
gift

314
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:52,659
sidelines that's the ground attacked
that's used for power signal ground

315
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:55,950
underneath that is the programming
contact that is by the manufacturer to

316
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,230
program the SIM card

317
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,860
where factory movies and napping that
will be using that

318
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,919
serial i/o pin that's right beneath that
that's how the computer talks the SIM

319
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:05,860
card

320
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,690
on the other side is the clock

321
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,830
that's where the reader sends a clock
signal to the SIM card chip

322
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:18,230
tell it what the cracked moderated make
sure to be using a 3.57 megahertz

323
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:22,200
clock which translate to a 9600

324
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,220
bought

325
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,470
signal above that is the reset

326
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,870
that's how the reader says hey wake up
for a to talk to you

327
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,110
and above that is the five full that
tasted powered

328
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:42,110
said

329
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:46,290
well

330
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:53,290
I'm a way well

331
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:30,500
dark

332
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,290
all well

333
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,260
well

334
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,800
I'd

335
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,600
well

336
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,400
ok

337
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,570
mark told

338
00:20:54,570 --> 00:21:01,290
funk

339
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,060
all how

340
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,970
I all

341
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,530
self

342
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:20,530
car side now

343
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,670
the SIM card reader slide in the SIM
card

344
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:28,780
that

345
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,830
it locks in

346
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:36,620
in the nine volt battery really

347
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:43,070
now connected

348
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,178
let in software it's like this year sick

349
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:54,179
for Windows public first thing will do
is extract save dismissed

350
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,450
SIM card some phones don't overwrite
seems

351
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,740
00 FF you can actually extract deleted
SMS is

352
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,870
every SMS message has

353
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,960
recipient sender the message

354
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:15,470
and steps you can see last last

355
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:20,540
self sleep

356
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,100
this is all contact if SIM card sent

357
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,280
used as a bat sometimes

358
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,790
excellent interests

359
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:38,790
contact gonna look at the same
information at this lol

360
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,679
mission serial number last location
phone was used in

361
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,320
statistics anything just just take the
reader

362
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,399
finally if you're interested in the
local paper called a douche

363
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,600
the debug window see you and information
was sent

364
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,110
art now let's say you want to close well
there's no way this

365
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,520
Park fire the secret key

366
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,870
but what you can do is perform known
plaintext attack

367
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,169
and that the SIM card tens of thousands
but I music's offer

368
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:11,290
right here and if it works out to get
the key

369
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,418
but I most since it doesn't work on any
longer

370
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:20,410
and I'll sell can't disable sums sell
our generous offer takes about six hours

371
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,679
let's give it a whirl year

372
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,529
do

373
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,980
I mom

374
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:37,429
model right so let's see how I made out

375
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,760
looks like that we were able to extract
the SIM card

376
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,279
Noah we would need to do is copy this
information to rate it will send

377
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:50,960
this project done writes that was a SIM
card acting to the

378
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,549
a

379
00:23:56,549 --> 00:24:00,408
it's very hard to make electronics
exciting and I of a succeeded

380
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:06,070
try to get some techno music said cervix
part is pay for hacking

381
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,908
up and a think about pay phones is
there's

382
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:13,190
all being decommissioned pretty much
going away there's millions of them

383
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,649
available and as we looked around I saw
these pay phones

384
00:24:16,649 --> 00:24:20,720
and we wanted to do something caught
that we also on still have a red box

385
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,750
cell we like what we gonna do it this
way so next act clip

386
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:32,750
so I'll

387
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,570
we decided to procure some self

388
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,879
some payphones to do some projects with

389
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,350
and probably so it was not just for the
intro for this video I it's not just

390
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,690
explain it very quickly

391
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,630
but you know muscle here where there's
to cut there's basically two kind to pay

392
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,610
phones out there

393
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,250
there's a standard telco style pay
phones and of coconuts

394
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,279
and calling phone kustra

395
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:02,059
clean operate telephones and other
actually have real computers insider

396
00:25:02,059 --> 00:25:04,480
them and when you pick up the phone
staked out town

397
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,279
and all the calculation about how much
money to put in with this time to hang

398
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:09,340
up for a Skype call

399
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,730
all that is done inside the payphone up
but

400
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,470
that took a pay phone switches had
pretty much the same design for like

401
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,100
thirty or forty years now and because I
didn't have my controllers

402
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,510
microprocessors when they were first
invented all love

403
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,049
the thinking in the hard work up what
monies owed in with a question but it

404
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,710
happened on the switch sides right at
the central office

405
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:34,600
so what that means is that these
patients are really done that actually

406
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,159
no electronics in them very violent
riots in them

407
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,570
and also all the control is done using
really strange voltages

408
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,139
that occur on the switch side so other
will show how you can modify payphone

409
00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:47,039
for home use

410
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,470
all the cool stuff that papon's do you
can't get out of the home phone line

411
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,090
you can't get it out the voltages that
come from home

412
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,000
home phone line to suck a special up
phone lines which

413
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,429
and but you know we got this pay phone

414
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:06,649
and we decided you know the stuff is so
cool we open it up and

415
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,510
I've never actually seen the inside of a
pay phone and so i thought well

416
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,860
I step back pay from from the outside
but at the nickel package from the

417
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,570
inside

418
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:19,370
instead so we can have split up the
project into three parts

419
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,460
for parts and we show some really cool
stuff

420
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:26,059
you can do is pay phones especially
telco style so

421
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,158
let's just play the video and will be
sign for

422
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:32,690
and you can play with PayPal have it the
vendor table downstairs its

423
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:35,889
not plugged in here but will have white
boxy can

424
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:39,200
packing to look similar a

425
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,210
which will look for is

426
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,269
fellow goes bill names anything that
says you know

427
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:50,200
the local telephone company every
benefit fund has its own

428
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,929
Tiki this used side

429
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:57,000
and her with the handset

430
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:03,649
whole front be careful cuz inside

431
00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:07,419
there's applied but perhaps

432
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:10,519
kicking up paper for home use

433
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,799
pretty easy first you'll need a
telephone wire that has

434
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,529
telephones fate logs on one and and

435
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:21,850
standards cooder feet

436
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,870
the telephone spade lugs

437
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:28,679
through the back fell then connect

438
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,039
the red wire which is the

439
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:36,919
bring to this terminal block

440
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,779
marked are second connect

441
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:46,789
that green spade lug which is tip to

442
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:53,789
the tear apart T

443
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,570
finally take the black and yellow wire
it or not going to be used

444
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,250
anti than to the ground connector that

445
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,990
coin counting Secretary has to be
jumpers so that the phone doesn't expect

446
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,740
according to be inserted Fort Lee

447
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,960
call now that's actually been done here
by

448
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,430
jumper and in five in pin 8 on this
flood

449
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,860
otherwise you can just solder wiring to
to

450
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,750
now simply plug the pay phone at your
home phone line

451
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,340
or in this case avoid box now's the time
to test the wiring

452
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:35,340
pretty easy just call for frontline

453
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,350
ok

454
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:45,539
there is a distinct parts for PayPal on
the left there's

455
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,480
Quoin sorting mechanism which takes
valid currency and then

456
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,030
below that is the coin hopper this
records are stored wallop

457
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:56,559
pay for makes phone call and then this
is the quandary is a

458
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:59,580
as controls whether point in the hopper
go into

459
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,750
Queen box or if they're trashy on the
right side there's

460
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,090
the bell the phone line terminal block

461
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,870
that cling telling oscillator and the
connectors and jumpers for

462
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:16,230
to have to the Paypal cares for the
total I would live now unfortunately the

463
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,440
total lighter with work does pay from
before

464
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,740
captured and the other half the pay
phone there's the headsets which %uh

465
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,480
detector

466
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,159
the telling passengers on the back and
the DTMF encoder and walk

467
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,510
to the Queen assembly first flip slash

468
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,530
then reach and and pressure on the wire
right

469
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,600
part just comes out to

470
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,740
open at that point assembly schist but
open

471
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,620
these magnets also with

472
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,309
calling is inserted into the payphone it
travels down the chute

473
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:54,320
now in this case a quarter will pass by
quarter separator

474
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,059
only if it's the crack size in WAT will
overtake the separator

475
00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,780
cuz it to pass past this magnet this
magnitude than any current inside the

476
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:06,559
conductive metal up the point which
costs to slow down a little bit

477
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,270
and bypass this year to continue into
this one

478
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:16,230
where that point except the coin and
drops

479
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,090
into the hopper where the payphone
awaited switch tells it whether to

480
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:23,820
put that point and click inbox or return
it

481
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,889
their trenches those papers ready to
make phone calls from home

482
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:30,630
but better much fun well im jus modifies
pay sound so

483
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,960
part quits for ok said there's a
totalizing I want to add a sensor

484
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,890
checkpoint

485
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,740
a wonderful one here on the side of
lower this entire winnie is a breaking

486
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,409
sensor

487
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:45,480
it in mid-air detector and when object
is between

488
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,650
the tentacles of kinda flat peace card

489
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:53,140
supple the clue

490
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,909
onto the hopper trigger right here clue
the flap of the hopper trigger

491
00:30:57,909 --> 00:31:01,250
and now it's time to solder first part

492
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,480
is 0

493
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,549
well well was what's

494
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:10,668
well small was

495
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:15,540
what's wells

496
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,740
well phones

497
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:23,890
wells workers

498
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:30,890
last you home year well

499
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,870
files ways

500
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,929
this is the coin detector and phone
controller that we start with

501
00:31:40,929 --> 00:31:45,450
I as a past client using four AA
batteries came to the

502
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:49,290
battery pack and this is the power
supply has just

503
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:52,960
capacitor just to regulate the power an
overall indicator LED

504
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,010
down and then I fucked up the

505
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,570
sensor that will detect when acquiring
have gone down the flock

506
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,139
at that's connected to a flat which will

507
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,799
take the small piles that cultural
center and convert it into

508
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,040
steady voltage which then controls
telecom relay

509
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,158
that's a really that specifically
designed to control the high telecom

510
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,799
voltages at work of a five yr old

511
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,250
so it's perfect so testing the sensor

512
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,540
type card from them include sensor

513
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:31,540
into the pic

514
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:36,560
know it would be this sensor make

515
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:43,560
two wires with spade lugs on hand

516
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,940
caked on spade lugs to the phone line
ring and the others face blood

517
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:55,940
to the peso

518
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:03,250
now playing in those two jumper wires
into really that clip the clean relay

519
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:03,779
open

520
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,779
now stand the test

521
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:10,039
our system turn on the battery pack and

522
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,419
pick up there will be a downtown

523
00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:16,769
now press on that quite hopper trigger

524
00:33:16,769 --> 00:33:19,950
sunsets million thousand

525
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,530
sir

526
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:25,678
now with the fam back together took the
Queen out later

527
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,040
close it up now know they can make a
phone call my speck case on

528
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,090
ballistic quarter now playing the Queen
elevator make sure the careful

529
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:37,160
sensor replaced finally

530
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:41,390
wire up above sensor between the power
from the battery pack and the circuit

531
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:41,860
board

532
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,660
so when the switch is pressed power to
the forget cat

533
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:51,150
cliff a sense if so when the phone is

534
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,780
on ok the switch is depressed to
requiring either I'm going to crimp on

535
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,460
some

536
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:03,460
loves onto the switch contacts

537
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:13,679
for these wires to the small hole in the
PayPal bottom

538
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:22,380
into the power connector up

539
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,060
this paper an income with the point not
someone YouTube look up instead

540
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:29,650
spot in the back finally

541
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:36,400
stash power supply and a circuit board
from but the for the coin boxes

542
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,990
unlock it again with the Tiki slide on

543
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,520
of

544
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,520
now close at the hopes

545
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,720
no doubt I'll

546
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,890
its exporter I got out I'm somehow

547
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,700
front is done

548
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,049
cell make a payphone project works
pretty well

549
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:15,538
but i wanna i'm open old-school charm to
it for the Queen going directly to the

550
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:17,829
Queen box reprint an hour 27 hopper

551
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:21,359
and then when the phone is how I have
the coin really will activate

552
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,890
and the final top into the point box
making nice chick

553
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:31,890
time to crack open the paper and this is
that clearly that we could open

554
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:38,529
now I wanna and club at to after this
really any 230 volts

555
00:35:38,529 --> 00:35:42,420
but only had a hundred rubles kicking
around her cuz hooked up to a payphone

556
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,130
phone line

557
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:47,369
the phone can generate 48 volts but
didn't have enough current to drive to

558
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,880
realize someone I have to build my own
DC power supply from the battery pack

559
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,910
and clean box

560
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,288
for sale do is build the high voltage
power

561
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:00,170
I to

562
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:03,880
this

563
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,250
I

564
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:13,390
it

565
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:19,460
close

566
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:26,460
class this is a basic dc-dc boost
converter based on the

567
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:31,059
Lt 1073 chip this ship actually doesn't
list all the work

568
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:36,210
all that's required is an inductor
Schottky diode and some capacitors

569
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,690
for the open output and earth just to
set the up footage

570
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,460
the input battery pack power comes in
here and the output 30 volts

571
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,319
comes out of the screen players before
wireless up to our

572
00:36:48,319 --> 00:36:51,940
existing circuit and went to test the
voltage just measure

573
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,029
for the multimeter the village with
between the two liars should be around

574
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:59,410
variables now a good time to test the
dc-dc boost converter

575
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,489
and connect at the converter to the
switch

576
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:06,309
so that's only Howard when the phone is
on ok but

577
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:10,710
remove the spring from the Queen relay
and then try testing the two

578
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:14,180
to promise to the Queen really make sure
activates

579
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,129
plug in the power so it's fully
activated when this phone is on hook

580
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,749
moved it clean relay return spring this
will make it easier to activate word

581
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:29,380
judges with the clean up our

582
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:34,039
connected 30 volts output 22 connectors
for the relay

583
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,999
G in this three here the relation up
today

584
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:43,219
wanted to verify to work attach the
problems currently

585
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:48,339
taking a one-way makes the going going
to the coin box

586
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:54,319
headed the other way the quiz we're
going to return shoes were nice things

587
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:57,869
about the West elected pay for designs
is that there's a little reed relay

588
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:02,549
wait where the Queen detector is that is
at once the Corning

589
00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:07,509
we lay activates this disconnect and the
really I'm at the opens

590
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:10,719
look at this board down a little bit
this link it fit later

591
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,920
and they can use the extra

592
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,509
the project then put the circuit board a
little baggie the sill protect the high

593
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,420
voltages from touching some other

594
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,819
for that for okay

595
00:38:25,819 --> 00:38:32,819
everything Deccan Queen box and close up
a felon and test this last long

596
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,160
to try it out pick up the handset

597
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,670
and a support that the court is in the
hopper

598
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,110
Hannah clearly the possible box

599
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:53,090
so I've got this

600
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:56,840
payphone to live for home use and I've
taken it and

601
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,560
reverse engineer net and made it so that
now requires coins

602
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,400
to make a phone call and also added the
coin hopper and Queen really activation

603
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,410
but there's one more hack I want to do
on this phone before I get into that the

604
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,779
point understand how these damn papers
keep track of how much money's been

605
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:13,300
answered

606
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,770
in this paper on the total I there's
been taken out it normally sits here

607
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:19,810
and hassle arms that sticking to the
Queen validator

608
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,029
so that when it claimed falls through it
triggers

609
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,490
and set up for calling town of lipid
pink box here

610
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,250
the class letters a passive also that
generates 2200 hurts at 1700 hurts

611
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,750
you can try the coin toss their pretty
easily connect one diet

612
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,500
said and another diet pin for

613
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,370
tough j2 clip pin set into that tip

614
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,380
and pin for the ring

615
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,460
now into quarters assertiveness

616
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,540
pay toilet text that and it triggers the
quaint

617
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,600
oscillator for quarter five times ok

618
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,500
now that toll goes down the hall is
detected by the switch on the other side

619
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,000
the such looks at the current call rates
determines how much was the deposit and

620
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,810
how much money is at and

621
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:14,220
asks the user to please deposit more
money necessary in the late eighties

622
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:17,670
some clever person to read the belt just
as many wall or

623
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,760
just have headphones work for
observation and determined that

624
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,980
if you play this twenty wonder
assumption hurt tens into the microphone

625
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:28,520
it was good enough online and switch and
yes I did before thinking

626
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,400
the totalizing quite also army those
towns and that's what red boxing

627
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,880
for let boxing became much more popular
when it was noticed that the dual total

628
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,860
two frequencies from the Queen to ask
their

629
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:42,350
addressing fortunately towns generate
when you hit the star key NFL

630
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:45,900
and the last time the perfect pushups
whatever Chris of that are striving

631
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,670
the DTMF decoder chip to make peace
special calling

632
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,800
of where counts you don't need a point
of litter box you could use a DTMF

633
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,530
generator

634
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,950
like this old Radio Shack turned out
this way sixteen-years-old

635
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:00,960
all they do is change the crystal so

636
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,380
open it up and talk about the of crystal
for this

637
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:09,690
a 6.5 factory six megahertz crystal now
that I will emit

638
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,860
the same towns necessary when you get
this turkey

639
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:18,120
now due to very sad to fry measures the
emergence Cocotte

640
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,180
an ATT def taking a pay for online
service when boxing is a rarity

641
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,770
it's pretty much impossible to do
anymore that will change come down in a

642
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,130
box it would like to use it

643
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:30,990
so are they doing a lot of highest-paid
thoughts like red box out

644
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:37,540
Queens for the didn't want to use

645
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,640
and eat enough to cover chip if the
chips are used in

646
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,040
you know old voicemail systems like
pressing one or two or three would

647
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,980
you open a lot to close at only uses
chips and studies in the crystal it's

648
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,030
supposed to be used to that

649
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,840
and want to change it to a different
crystals the same one used to hack right

650
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,470
boxes

651
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,570
so that both of them are looking for the
same frequency towns

652
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,180
now to detect when the star key is
pressed that the same as Redbox

653
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,330
while

654
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,500
where

655
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:14,880
mom mom mom whoa

656
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,970
the

657
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:21,099
the okay now's the time to test the red
box time detector

658
00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,349
here circuitry for the red box detector
now I've got the DTMF decoder with

659
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:27,859
Newcrest also can you take red box towns

660
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:32,790
and I've got this selector lot now I
make sure the only when the star key is

661
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,320
pressed

662
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,760
well alaska hi and useful indicator LEDs
will

663
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,950
blink when it to text around Boston
that's very useful for debugging

664
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,900
to connect up to the handset and listen
to the audio coming for microphone and

665
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:44,700
winter jacket

666
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,720
external clock felt this is the
reference crowd

667
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,770
number eleven and this red wire

668
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:54,320
is from the handset makers from the
microphones that's gonna be audio

669
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,400
abdicated the train line from our Relay

670
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,980
and jumper that just so we can do this
test having to worry about the relator

671
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,310
of okay pick up the handset will be a
downturn

672
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,770
and you'll see that this board is let
the Greeley the start

673
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,920
now red box you'll see that the green
LED lights out because it detected the

674
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,430
star

675
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,359
so physicist and certain to work

676
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,848
but there's one problem now because the
payphone is designed to be queen for

677
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,369
status

678
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,680
we don't connect the phone line until we
get money or

679
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,910
red boxing no there's no power to the
microphone

680
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,740
so the circuit can actually listen in on
the microphone because there's no power

681
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,940
but worse I was pretty easy by biasing

682
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,280
handset ourselves by using a 50 power
supply

683
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,140
Leslie the internal power I've headset
supposed to be five also its kinda look

684
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,868
instance for soccer fly audio input to
the circuit they'll come from here

685
00:43:48,869 --> 00:43:54,859
and centering now text the ground
reference

686
00:43:54,859 --> 00:44:00,940
echoes appear now to connect

687
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:03,950
the fire started the handset that goes
into the handset

688
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:10,470
10

689
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,220
as telecom really double felt the need
to actually two switches inside

690
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,720
and then use that second switch to
connect and disconnect that

691
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,440
ice power so only when we don't have the
phone line connected

692
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,890
here will there be powered the handset
this way r5 also compete with the phone

693
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:26,839
line football's

694
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:30,259
one more thing to do that's close up
pics okay projects done

695
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:34,040
and raise it pick up the phone no doubt
own

696
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,569
get my hand the red box now wat Kost

697
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:45,569
cops you

698
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:49,220
you

699
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:56,220
to cesaria on

700
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:00,890
the way the way this place here

701
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,589
like Hong Kong style like it's a little
bit of so we're gonna like Chinese

702
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,750
like yellow to they don't have it
sightseeing in the middle where I like

703
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,610
such as head of

704
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:13,150
yeah so this is also an HD you can
download the one gigabyte

705
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,840
by you know actual size version you know
have a big enough screen

706
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,730
up and I we hope to do one of these
every so often

707
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:24,390
about some of the older technologies
kinda with and it was too

708
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,470
not just yeah some special hope memorial

709
00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:31,950
addition yes so you know using this
video and all the

710
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:35,400
source code schematics everything we put
on such as an engineer dot com

711
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,750
you get a pay phone and dual all these
projects you can build

712
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,280
what are the SIM card reader so we have
time for questions up

713
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:46,570
yes actually 10 minutes so if you have
questions haha up

714
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:53,570
up not a you to go the microphone where

715
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,140
you rip your wannabes telephones whether
some in the lobby do you have a truck

716
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:03,140
yeah you because there's 2.4 million

717
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:07,009
pay phones out there but does not
anymore 234 million customers who pay

718
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:07,500
phones

719
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,960
and they're getting uninstalled if you
look at our new york Elsey boots

720
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,680
and the pavements been taken out not
stolen it has been decommissioned

721
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,440
ATT's been losing money on pay for it
for so long

722
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,920
they were required to keep provide papon
service do that

723
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,090
filbrick ill health stuff online so EVA
up

724
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,030
crazy first recently they were free from
maintaining a

725
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:33,190
its own out there yes on and selling
them on Craigslist I have

726
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:36,940
an RSS feed but just as pay found and
it's for everywhere

727
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:41,280
you get really weird stuff obviously
from Craigslist and pay found I

728
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,930
doing the one about fifty dollars yeah I
mean if any cheap nowadays

729
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:49,779
and people have warehouses for these so
you just it believe it or not if you

730
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,210
look from you actually find a lot

731
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:54,270
just make sure if you want to do this
hacking to get down when these

732
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,040
old-school 1c2

733
00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:00,270
22 telco payphones because again if it's
a coke II

734
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,480
I know you can offer for home use but
it's more complicated

735
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,890
because basically just pick circuit
board so make sure when it's open it's

736
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:07,250
like

737
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:10,480
mechanical all again along parts like to
camp stuff

738
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,940
thank you by

739
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,060
evidencing with the your newer
technologies

740
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,660
specially with like building computers
stuff motherboards are actually

741
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,069
phasing out the serial port yeah and I
was wondering where some the

742
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,490
alternatives because some your projects
actually have serial port

743
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,200
entries and well there's still a lot of
computers at to have serial ports

744
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,700
but likely to get a USB serial converter
for like 10

745
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,430
dollars I'll social media just doing USB
on board is a little difficult

746
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,690
so I was so real and then it's like elf
you have no issue for this a fifteen

747
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:50,270
twelve dollar adapter that you can get a
Radio Shack that's not

748
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:54,270
too difficult alright thanks one of the
things that

749
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:57,970
a lot of our kids at making some tickets
and lamar makes they have a serial port

750
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,910
to communicate

751
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:02,120
with them and obvious like that but as
you're saying serial ports

752
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,870
things are changing it's not parallel
port I mean people

753
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,279
your reports are still like not
completely obsolete

754
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,130
so one of the things we're probably
gonna do is have com part of a kid

755
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:17,130
are the USB part already assembled that
usually surface mount and that beginners

756
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,340
can just do all the rest

757
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,650
with three holes so that that's
something we're doing on the good side

758
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:22,950
with electronic manufacturers you now

759
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:29,950
we don't have to weed out of control
still need to do like speed were

760
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:33,730
a you mentioned %uh we know here um you

761
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,340
there's something called wiring which is
like the older brothers that were

762
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:40,960
I'll ought to be no would you ever
consider making projects for

763
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,760
some got some I I think wiring is really
awesome but is just

764
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,680
much more expensive and I like the
simplicity and low cost

765
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,859
and near commodification nearly

766
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,280
Arduino hard work that's why I've been
focusing on that

767
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,190
many wiring for the think about a
hundred dollars that's three times as

768
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,000
much as far as we know

769
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,700
so you still about 50 pins two serial
ports

770
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:08,340
yep the I found that a lot of beginners
projects they don't need fifty pence or

771
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,510
like I wanna blinking LED when the
doorbells pressed so like

772
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:14,880
this allows them to be something simple
like that that's the only reason

773
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,950
but where is excellent and definitely a
and you know a good choice to step up

774
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:25,950
to who thanks what about dialing into
the payphone

775
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:30,750
an so at this time display phone doesn't
allow dialing in

776
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,980
but it's actually really really easy and
we decided

777
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:37,980
the didn't make much sense for me to do
on video but basically

778
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,460
I a full-wave rectifier SCR in a couple
resistors

779
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,480
and basically when he gets the 90 volts
on the ring

780
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,050
voltage that set up the SCR and connects
this online so you don't have to put

781
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:49,750
mclean

782
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:53,770
to make a phone call thank you you can
do to help you could build this into a

783
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:54,350
video

784
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:58,210
and senator I don't think I'm gonna have
a link on the web page how to do that

785
00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:58,900
but

786
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:03,470
we decided like you know this was enough
the phone hacking

787
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:07,480
to get the information for the simple

788
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,520
and the information sciences engineer
dot com just

789
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,980
this interviewing owners I can if you in
like 10 minutes until after our talk is

790
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:16,650
done

791
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,590
it'll definitely be there but we can
right now because we're going to talk to

792
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,480
you have to get online I take up the
wifi

793
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,530
spot to the website yeah we set to
release the files tragic

794
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:34,530
okay and I think we're officially at a
time I just don't legislator

795
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:40,180
lol
