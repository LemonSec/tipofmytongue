1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:03,370
here so pleasure to be in New York City
with you folks

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,569
my name is Michael Perkins an
independent recording artist

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,890
and I operate my own small record label
in Dayton Ohio

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,190
for the purpose for the year

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,770
purpose of promoting and distributing my
own music and we're gonna hear today

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,830
is an original essay of mine that I've
adapted for a live audience

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,840
setting such as this and the intention
to this discussion is to publicly

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,689
state my opinion as an artist in regards
to piracy

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:36,530
on a lot of folks have taken the liberty
of speaking for the

10
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,030
artistic community is sorta defacto
spokespersons

11
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,690
about the subject and what I've noticed
is that most these people are out there

12
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,210
searching that artists

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,300
are adamantly against file-sharing
because it supposedly deprives us

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,700
have our livelihood on

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,680
my goal today is to present you with a
sort of philosophical

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,750
declaration on that strongly opposes
that conventional perception that

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,540
artists

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,759
and pirates are equitable to will and
water

19
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:12,859
on the title BSA is how piracy feeds a
starving audience the term starting

20
00:01:12,859 --> 00:01:13,990
audiences used

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,579
to define a sort a broad concept which
is that the global

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:22,450
collective audiences music participate
urs

23
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,859
I'm is starving in several different

24
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:29,209
regards one being that most of us

25
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:33,179
can't necessarily afford to go out and
spend too much money on these

26
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:36,490
in my opinion extremely overpriced CDs

27
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:40,119
many of which nowadays there more and
more containing

28
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:43,959
DRM now where and so

29
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,819
and the other regard is that most of us
are starving to hear something

30
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:53,590
knew something fresh something that is
progressive

31
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:57,020
in the sense that it moves music in a
direction

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,270
the world eager to you to witness

33
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,319
I should know that I'm not a legal
professional and that my knowledge in

34
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:05,039
the industry

35
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,800
extends only as far as my own personal
experience observation and research

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,860
however the crux of this discussion is
in that

37
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,050
personal philosophy that i'm advocating
based on

38
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,090
appreciation for technology in art

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,970
which I feel share remarkable connection

40
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,109
in that they both represent and facility

41
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,760
the progress of mankind the main points
that I'm going to attempt to make today

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
are that's a the music industry is
broken

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,940
and that peer to peer networking will
fix it also

44
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,260
that it is morally justifiable for

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,929
the global audience to take that music

46
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,210
and do what they will with it with that
said

47
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm gonna begin by addressing the nature
of the music industry

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,140
that's pretty much common knowledge

49
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,850
at the media conglomerate has made music
into a disposable

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,850
little products like it's a big mac or
something

51
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,430
I'm we'll have to watch as the
systematic desecration of the art form

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,420
is broadcast for us on the radio

53
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,740
and on television every single day in
high definition

54
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,780
for a very long time it's been standard
practice within the music industry to

55
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,040
create and sell marketable often
superficial

56
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,250
musical products that Coralie

57
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,790
with whatever the current social trends
are at the time I remember when I was in

58
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,609
high school is suddenly became popular
for well-to-do suburban kids to start

59
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,200
wearing

60
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,560
John Deere hats and overalls the cars
that everyone wanted to drive became

61
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,140
these huge four-wheel-drive trucks with
you know get er done in

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,319
confederate flag decals plastered across
the back window

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,600
and that the subsequent change in their
personalities

64
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,319
accents opinions political affiliations
in general behavior

65
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:56,459
match the trend impeccably to say the
least

66
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,440
so it came as no surprise to me when
almost immediately

67
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,550
contemporary pop country music became
the cool thing

68
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,430
to listen to I became impossible to walk
through our student parking lot at the

69
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,990
end of the day without being bombarded
by allowed

70
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,709
muddy sound collage up Kenny chesny Toby
Keith

71
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,430
and the rest of them of course as
quickly as a trend arrives on the social

72
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,840
scene it disappears and is replaced by
another equally Bain all set of cultural

73
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,169
standards for the flock

74
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:29,729
to abide by I'm sure you've all seen
this happen first hand

75
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:33,560
and when it does it's no accident
fashion and media are nearly

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,909
indistinguishable

77
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:39,279
in our culture and we can all assume
that in a cold dark board room somewhere

78
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,759
a crack team of marketing geniuses is
plotting the next package trend to be

79
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,930
injected

80
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:50,129
into the cerebral cortex up there target
audience

81
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:53,409
I see this as evidence that too them

82
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:56,590
music has about as much value as a pair
of jeans

83
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,189
or a dim-witted catch phrase another
stressor

84
00:05:00,189 --> 00:05:03,509
completely aware of this fact already
but it's important for me to acknowledge

85
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,870
it in this context because

86
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,020
that factors played a huge role in the
development of my opinion on the subject

87
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,460
to piracy

88
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,229
and why I'm reluctant flat-out unwilling
to accept the idea that the industry in

89
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,389
those who operated deserve my money

90
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,849
my respect as an audience

91
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:25,490
we've got used to the idea that the
majority records made today are about 90

92
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,120
percent filler

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,919
with one or two singles that are
supposed to motivate us to pay for the

94
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,568
entire

95
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:35,620
album this has been a typical product
model for decades and in Nashville in

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,909
the nineteen fifties

97
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,270
record companies were shelling out
massive quantities records

98
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,859
that contain 100 percent reissued
material from previous releases

99
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:47,719
they would include one or two hit
singles and fill the remaining space on

100
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,229
the LP with alder

101
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,029
more obscure tracks and they would turn
around and market the compilation as if

102
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,180
it were a full studio release

103
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,099
and wait for the box to roll in this
practice was a clever way

104
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,938
regenerating revenue from the one or two
hit singles on the record while tricking

105
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:03,770
the consumer

106
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,520
into paying the price the full studio
release

107
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,568
and nine times out of ten the artist
whose face was displayed on the cover

108
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:15,719
art had no involvement whatsoever in the
decision to release the album

109
00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:18,998
and now I'll admit that realistically
this practice wasn't really all that

110
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,150
reprehensible

111
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,689
in comparison to sum up the schemes that
have tarnished the dignity

112
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:28,009
at the industry but it does serve as a
fine example

113
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,029
up the mentality that's been evolving

114
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,599
in on the business side at the music
world for

115
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,740
very very long time nowadays they
utilize much dirtier

116
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,120
and more elaborate techniques to line
their pockets

117
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,969
for instance at some point in time they
discovered that they could take a cute

118
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:48,879
little teenage television star in the
Disney Channel

119
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,159
Center in a studio and hit the
mysterious studio magic button

120
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:57,839
which is also known as the interest
auto-tune plugin which can transform

121
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,069
the sound above a calf being slaughtered
into the offering for in a young

122
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:07,180
being Crosby so after a healthy does
that air brush

123
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,029
they notice that something very peculiar
would begin to happen

124
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:15,849
millions of dollars would begin to fall
from the sky

125
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:18,960
who'd have guessed that something so
powerful

126
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,129
so beautiful so important as the
creation music

127
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,389
could also be used as a spin-off over
trade

128
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,080
daytime sitcom we've gotten so used to
seeing things like this happen that it

129
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,460
seems we've all become

130
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,479
desensitized an apathetic

131
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,039
I mean I suppose it's possible that I
could be overly sensitive when it comes

132
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,900
to music but I would sooner choose to be
openly disgusted

133
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,149
by an atrocity them to simply ignore it
and Miley Cyrus record

134
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:54,149
certainly fits my definition of the word
atrocious

135
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,099
one quality of music is an art form that
I'm fascinated by is its universal

136
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:04,759
appeal everyone seems to enjoy it

137
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:08,949
unless of course you're plagued by music
eugenic epilepsy in which case it may

138
00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:12,559
cause you to experience wildly
unpleasant seizures

139
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:16,189
so I guess I should say that almost
everyone enjoys it but we all have our

140
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,430
personal taste

141
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,360
for what we consider to be good or
quality and I think it's safe to say

142
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
that most diverse

143
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,339
consider music to be an essential
element in our day-to-day lives

144
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,449
so it's understandable that throughout
history the recording industry

145
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,289
the major record companies have gladly
capitalized on the fact that the only

146
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,710
way people can obtain that crucial

147
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,660
cherished element in their lives was
that they went to a retail store and

148
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,260
purchased it

149
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,130
this gave those corporations nearly
unlimited control at the market and thus

150
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,560
control over we the consumer

151
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,450
today the music industry is dominated by
what is known as the Big Four

152
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,110
that Sony BMG Universal Music Group

153
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,240
Warner Music Group India mein these four
companies account for roughly 85 percent

154
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,980
of all music sales in the United States
with the remaining 15 percent being

155
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,990
divided up among

156
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,640
all the independent record labels in the
country

157
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,060
now £19.95 the Big Five this was before
Sony merge with BMG

158
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,830
and each adopted what was known as
minimum advertised price

159
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,920
format policies in order to squash a CD
price war that have been going on since

160
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,150
the early

161
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,140
nineties and the competition between
retailers it 'cause see prices to fall

162
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:33,220
as low as nine dollars and ninety nine
cents

163
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:37,740
which really twisted the pennies are
several entertainment executives

164
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,110
so they began requiring retailers to
charge no less than the arbitrary

165
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:45,210
minimum advertised price which of course
they decided

166
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,330
themselves if a large music retailer
didn't comply with this policy they risk

167
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,830
losing millions of dollars in revenue

168
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,270
and because the map policies allow
distributors to raise their prices that

169
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,460
will

170
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,350
which imposed unreasonable restraints of
trade as it's called

171
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,920
this practice qualified as a violation
of federal antitrust laws

172
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,709
and in 2000 the Federal Trade Commission
respectfully ask the big five if they

173
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,040
would

174
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,849
we use stop they reached a settlement
agreement

175
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,150
that required the majors to discontinue
the policy but unfortunately however

176
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,329
justice showed up a little late to work
that day

177
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,930
and according to FTC chairman robert
pitofsky

178
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,940
this particular crime ended up costing
US consumers 480 million dollars more

179
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,670
than we should have paid for CDs

180
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,640
over the course just 3 years

181
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,510
so in case there was any doubt this
should confirm even further that we are

182
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,910
all forced to play by

183
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,300
their rules when it comes time to visit
the cash register for checkout

184
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,790
regardless of whether or not those rules
are fair ethical

185
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,709
or even legal and to an extent I can
understand having to abide by their

186
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,320
prices and policies this

187
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,530
just the way a market economy works but
I soon I'm not alone when I say that the

188
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,959
way they play the game

189
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,650
the way they unabashedly disregard any
appreciation for the arts and for the

190
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,640
audience

191
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,150
has always made me feel like I was being
kicked around and taking advantage of

192
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,449
and more and more the evidence leads me
to believe that sadly

193
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,450
I'm correct in for example as

194
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,470
1988 autobiography in keep that number
in my 1988

195
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,440
it's called the real frank zappa book
there's a chapter towards the end it's

196
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,180
all about

197
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:30,690
failure and %uh zappa share some stories
in this chapter of what he considered to

198
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,280
be his

199
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,069
unsuccessful endeavors from over the
years and one who struck me as

200
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,040
particularly

201
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,689
profound Zampa said that he had once
tried to get the ball rolling on an idea

202
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,050
he had for a system

203
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:46,090
where people could order albums over the
phone

204
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,290
the album's would then be transferred
via the telephone line

205
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,569
into the persons on cassette deck they
would be able to simply press the record

206
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,340
button

207
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:58,720
and who've they had their album now the
time that frank zappa's book was

208
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,580
published

209
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,330
this idea probably seem like a total
pipe dream but it's quite apparent to us

210
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,400
now

211
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
that's he predicted almost exactly what
would come

212
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,550
to revel in revolutionized music not
only to the yearly predict the

213
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,690
technology

214
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,270
and our implementation at it but he also
said that it would collapse the

215
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,880
recording industry

216
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,490
entirely today we found ourselves

217
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,110
at the heart have almost that exact
revolution

218
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,320
we've witnessed sabers technological
prophecy

219
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,140
unfold and evolve into this amazing peer
to peer system that's currently

220
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,750
opening our minds to new possibilities
for artists and audiences alike

221
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,620
a person can now simply sit in a chair
think I've whatever album or song they'd

222
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,940
like to hear

223
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,940
with all their little fingers a bit and
within moments

224
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,750
that album or song begins playing it's
almost as if we can sit motionless

225
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,170
close our eyes and will ourselves to
begin listening to whatever we want

226
00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:00,210
for free this is the beautiful
convenience

227
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,660
the tech community is created for the
world music

228
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,740
and like many technological advances it
would have been considered

229
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,500
science fiction only a few decades ago

230
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,010
as more people begin to access the net
in this strange new train called

231
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,110
file-sharing began to take hold

232
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,760
the industry was really turned upside
down spanked around a bit

233
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,800
you know the big four in the RIAA didn't
like this new little thorn in their side

234
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,930
matter-of-fact they called up their most
trusted weapon

235
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,300
an epic figurehead have keen intellect
and physique

236
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,930
mythological proportions almost his fury
is known only perhaps to his mutilated

237
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,470
victims inter Lars Ulrich

238
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:53,470
the award-winning MTV reality show
metallic

239
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,120
his cynicism wall

240
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,209
us you okay reviews she huge

241
00:14:29,209 --> 00:14:34,110
so yes here he said

242
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:41,110
you know

243
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:46,149
shared yessum football

244
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:50,450
sunrise

245
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,760
shit say head

246
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,760
it

247
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,329
this well

248
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:11,350
yes

249
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:18,350
I'm more if

250
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,700
now this PSA here's a good example love
the RIAs first-generation wave

251
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,260
PR attacks on the community and for
obvious reasons it fell short

252
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:35,950
just like everything else that Lars all
rick has ever come into contact with

253
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:42,010
I would it take a moment here to make a
prediction if I mean

254
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:47,290
one day several years from now I predict
that Lars will wake up

255
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:52,680
Paisley stumble out his dead wife is
sleepy little eyes and give a big yawn

256
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,140
and then I'll accidentally catch a
glimpse at himself in the mirror

257
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,970
to ponder for a moment and suddenly

258
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,910
realized for the first time that even
though he's seen a lot of things he's

259
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,500
been a lot of places he said a lot a
difficult life experiences

260
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,730
that somehow somehow he is still managed

261
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,800
to wind up being lowers all Rick

262
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,510
a petty little man servant to warner
brothers CEO

263
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,069
his body scarred by years of being used
as a human ashtray

264
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,610
an exclusive Beverly Hills Country Club
at that moment I pretty to throw himself

265
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,500
out the window

266
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,509
moving on

267
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:38,529
when they're hilariously bad propaganda
didn't work they decided star randomly

268
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,230
drawing names from a hat

269
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,029
and suing whoever was unlucky enough to
be the next contestant

270
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:48,730
RIAA investigators began using peer to
peer clients to search for copyright

271
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,919
protected material

272
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,759
they would determine the IP address the
person sharing this material

273
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,309
and issue a subpoena that person's ISP
in order to determine their name and

274
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,738
other personal information

275
00:16:58,739 --> 00:17:02,989
now according to the RIAA their legal
ability to force ISP's to turn over

276
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:05,279
their customers personal data came from

277
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,638
a provision within the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act of 1998

278
00:17:09,639 --> 00:17:13,049
this is the DMCA that you may have all
heard about

279
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:18,359
lobbyists from the RIAA had inserted a
carefully worded clauses which they

280
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,850
interpreted as a green light to bypass

281
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:25,438
any judicial oversight when issuing the
subpoenas so on september 8

282
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,350
2003 261 Americans including a
12-year-old girl living in the projects

283
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,668
here in New York City with her single
mother

284
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,929
were sued as a result abuse DMCA

285
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:41,500
subpoenas about two months later a
federal court ruled that this method of

286
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,110
obtaining personal information was
illegal

287
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,679
which cause the RIAA to change their
little course amid

288
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,409
of course does that mean that anyone
affected by these illegal tactics got

289
00:17:51,409 --> 00:17:52,510
their money back

290
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,889
now nearly five years later it is
estimated that over twenty thousand

291
00:17:56,889 --> 00:17:58,019
people

292
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,320
have been sued and many of them
financially crippled by the RIAA

293
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,970
as according to the Electronic Frontier
Foundation what this fact be a clear

294
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,899
indication

295
00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:11,010
that we're very much engaged in a war

296
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,580
not without casualties we can all assume
that people are going to continue to be

297
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:19,668
sued because that's about the only
offensive measure that the RIAA has in

298
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:20,490
its arsenal

299
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,519
without the returnees there like a jet
fighter without wings

300
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:29,240
fuel were ammunition yes the lawsuits
will indeed continue

301
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,669
especially keep using their loss to try
to shut down peer to peer applications

302
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:34,720
and web sites

303
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,549
that's a given however the uselessness
at this maneuver can best be understood

304
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:40,399
by noting its effect

305
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:44,330
and we all remember the old days before
new clients bring up on a seemingly

306
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,139
daily basis one gets slapped with a
lawsuit or a cease and desist

307
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:53,510
and shuts down and then 10 more go up
and we saw this happen when they took

308
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:57,470
down Napster with the nearly instant
arrival a multitude have similar

309
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,110
software applications that absorbs all
of those Napster refugees

310
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:04,200
and the wildfire quality of technology

311
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,399
ends ensures that the global audience
will have lifelong access

312
00:19:08,399 --> 00:19:11,639
to new improved methods of obtaining
music and other media

313
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:16,500
and we are all indebted to the tech
community for that arent agonists must

314
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,750
be well aware that the battle they're
waging

315
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,649
is already lost because trying to be the
progress of technology

316
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:27,510
is about as futile as pushing a mountain
in an attempt to spin the earth

317
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,830
in the opposite direction I make it a
point to do my best to observe how human

318
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,769
beings myself included go about our
lives and I've noticed a very

319
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:36,879
interesting

320
00:19:36,879 --> 00:19:42,080
repeating occurrence we humans always
take the quickest path between two

321
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,010
points

322
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,490
and once that has been determined there
really isn't much they can never

323
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,990
discourage us from taking it again

324
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,440
and again and again I believe it's this

325
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,169
in a human characteristic that fuels the
demand for the peer to peer system and

326
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,889
that's exactly why it's quickly becoming
set in stone as the standard by which we

327
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:00,510
measure

328
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:05,000
our access to music and other media no
matter what digital alternatives the

329
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,570
recording industry comes up with

330
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,990
no matter how much they try to scare us
into paying for overpriced records the

331
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,659
global audience will always take the
cheaper

332
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,289
more efficient more convenient path
regardless

333
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,720
the slight chance they may be soon but
that won't stop them from trying to

334
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,299
convince you that their digital
alternatives are equally or more

335
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:24,460
convenient

336
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,909
I don't use iTunes but from what I've
gathered you're paying roughly about

337
00:20:27,909 --> 00:20:28,750
purse on

338
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,970
now suing that you exclusively use
iTunes to you obtain

339
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,000
all your music 100 percent legally and
let's say you've got yourself a 40 gig

340
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,049
iPod that's about 10,000 songs

341
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:42,679
it's gonna cost you ten thousand dollars
to fill that iPod

342
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,299
go ahead and compare that figure with
the cost pirating this 10,000 songs and

343
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:49,230
you'll see why this alternative

344
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:53,399
will never take the place the pew pew
again what's the shortest distance

345
00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:54,980
between the two points

346
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,210
it doesn't get any cheaper than zero
dollars and something that's free

347
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:02,700
is always way better than something I
have to pay for

348
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,869
so what we've established you thus far
is that the music industry conglomerate

349
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:08,629
has had a comfortable free ride for
decades

350
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:12,320
and it's been strikingly similar to the
oil industry in a lot of ways

351
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,779
because they know that we need their
product and they know that will pay

352
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,399
whatever price they decide to put on it

353
00:21:17,399 --> 00:21:20,750
furthermore document reprehensible acts
in order to keep things that way

354
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,369
regardless of who may be caught in the
crossfire

355
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,590
world what principles may be desecrated
in doing so

356
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,649
of course no one is being slaughtered in
countries are being obliterated for the

357
00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:33,010
profit music so I should make it clear
that

358
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,940
the comparison I'm drawing here is
intended to undermine the serious nature

359
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,919
of that issue

360
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,020
but imagine if suddenly we were all
introduced to a method

361
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,590
up acquiring free gasoline a method that
could never be withheld from our

362
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,658
disposal

363
00:21:46,659 --> 00:21:51,230
it would grow and grow and grow as time
went on when we all end up collapsing

364
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,399
the oil industry fairly quickly

365
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:56,899
more importantly would we all be morally
justified

366
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,940
in doing so after all we were silent for
so long as we allowed ourselves to be

367
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,960
victimized by their weekend money-making
agenda

368
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,119
wouldn't we be in that situation be
entitled to meet you serve that free gas

369
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,020
method

370
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,020
if for no other reason and to show the
megalomaniac how it feels to be

371
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,860
defenseless

372
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,510
against the force much larger than them

373
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,779
he

374
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:27,440
indeed what's been established years
that piracy will never be defeated

375
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,399
because conveniences a sorta few min
psychological imperative the means to

376
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:34,869
access free music will always exist
within our society

377
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:38,779
for the audience this basically means an
opportunity to justifiably stick it to

378
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:40,220
the man

379
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,100
for artists however it means being
plucked from the old world

380
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,840
and drop smack dab in the middle and
unfamiliar crossroads where they're

381
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,709
faced with the decision

382
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,700
to either play by the old rules or start
adapting to the new

383
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:59,059
because that whole piracy hurts artist's
ID is based around one thing

384
00:22:59,059 --> 00:23:03,399
profit the logic is that if an artist
spins one thousand dollars to make a

385
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,039
record

386
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,330
he or she must make that one thousand
dollars back before they can turn a

387
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,000
profit right

388
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,909
well how are they supposed to accomplish
that if people aren't buying their

389
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:13,039
records

390
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,330
now it's important to keep in mind for
indie artist their total cost making a

391
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,389
record may end up being a few thousand
dollars and of course that depends

392
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:21,809
entirely on the circumstance

393
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:25,260
but for a major label artists that
figure could be hundreds upon hundreds

394
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,779
of thousands of dollars provided of
course by the artists label

395
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:34,659
which intends to get that money back and
one way or another

396
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:38,909
so people ask this question if an artist
is it making a profit

397
00:23:38,909 --> 00:23:42,690
how can he or she afford to feed
themselves and pay the rent

398
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,869
I think the trip to figuring this out is
by looking at how the question is being

399
00:23:45,869 --> 00:23:49,240
worded that very simple question has
been distorted

400
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,159
ever so slightly to the point where now
is becoming an artist isn't selling

401
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,559
units how can he or she forty

402
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,260
that to me is the problem the logic that
they're using

403
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,860
is the units equal profit but if you
simply choose to word the question

404
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,980
differently or look at it from a
different angle you get a drastically

405
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,779
different answer

406
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:15,230
here's how I choose to see it cost in
this situation determines

407
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,929
profit how much you spend to meet your
record

408
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:24,289
with two major product is what
determines when you get to make

409
00:24:24,289 --> 00:24:28,169
your profit if instead a few thousand
dollars I always been a couple hundred

410
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:32,580
dollars my profit is obviously going to
star rolling in much quicker

411
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,110
and much easier now when I mentioned
earlier than artists are going to have

412
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,559
to adapt this is what I was referring to

413
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,779
the artists and companies that are going
to be detrimentally affected by piracy

414
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:46,580
are the ones that continue to play the
whole game on the new playing field

415
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,000
if you're an independent artist I think
that your mission should be to cut

416
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,100
spending as much as possible to allow
for easier accumulation

417
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,940
a profit income if I only spent a couple
hundred dollars to make a record in my

418
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,119
bedroom

419
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,970
and set up a couple thousand dollars to
make a record in a professional studio

420
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:06,559
then I'm not so concerned with making
sure that everyone who is listening has

421
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,750
paid for the privilege to do so

422
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,440
the music itself then becomes less of a
product and more that's cool for the

423
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,359
accumulation a fan base

424
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,710
which can also produce income from
merchandise and or concert ticket sales

425
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,039
it also allows you to use a free digital
download as an incentive for folks to

426
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:27,849
purchase items by saying

427
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:31,830
by my t-shirt and get a free digital
copy at my record

428
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,359
you can justify charging a few extra
dollars for the t-shirt

429
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,389
your fan wore mine in fact I'll probably
see it is a completely fair deal

430
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:42,599
I think that this is the key to starting
a trend that will benefit the audience

431
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,399
as well as the artist in those involved
with the production

432
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:48,429
the music it baffles me to watch

433
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:52,820
unknown bands charge fifteen dollars for
their CD which no one has heard yet

434
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,330
while refusing to provide the ability
for potential listeners to download

435
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,199
their songs to meet it completely defies
logic for anyone whose goal is to build

436
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,859
a fan base to essentially hold their own
material hostage

437
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,770
by requiring people to pay a ransom in
order to hear it

438
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:13,059
perhaps it would be a bad idea to show
some patience worry about the quality of

439
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:15,510
the music first and then your exposure

440
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,190
and then once people are willing to pay
you money you can start worrying about

441
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,940
your price:

442
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,530
artists desperately need to avoid greed
at all costs if we want success

443
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:31,030
to be determined by the quality the
music in america if its creator

444
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,789
when starting musicians fantasize about
hitting the big time

445
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:39,859
the dream assigning a huge contract with
a major label six figures 10 albums

446
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:43,820
hundreds have groupies Michael ours was
saying up there

447
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,418
for over half a century musicians
musicians have had drilled into their

448
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:51,929
brains that the road to easy street is
lined with a in our representatives

449
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,419
armed with ballpoint pens and super cool
suits and hairdos

450
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,970
getting signed to a major label is
thought to be the highest accomplishment

451
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:01,849
the musician can try for

452
00:27:01,849 --> 00:27:05,480
and so most artists will say anything
where anything do anything if they think

453
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,460
it will somehow get them closer to that
objective

454
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,529
now however with more and more signs
pointing to the notion that yesterday's

455
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,359
method for me producing music is
inefficient

456
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,849
and will soon be obsolete maybe we can
begin to set a new goal

457
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:23,549
have a goal to create music with death
and originality that represents the

458
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,990
individuality of the artist

459
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,080
as a foreign concept to a lot of people
today

460
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,109
music world today the mainstream
standards for style sounds production

461
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:34,859
techniques

462
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:38,559
image in pretty much every other aspect
of the art form is set by a handful of

463
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,889
men in suits

464
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:43,349
who based the standards purely on
marketability

465
00:27:43,349 --> 00:27:47,158
when the industry falls apart as a
result piracy which I'm certain that it

466
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,270
will

467
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,109
surely these men in suits will no longer
be such important factors in the public

468
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:52,918
perception

469
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,659
musical value this idea is at the core
of my opinion a piracy as well

470
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:03,309
what's to stop us then from witnessing
the growth the groundbreaking techniques

471
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:06,799
and new genres that will never before
possible let alone accepted as

472
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,609
legitimate

473
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,980
we've established that this trend of
technology adding music is unstoppable

474
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,070
so I think it's safe to assume that any
art is not willing to adapt to it

475
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,428
and help promote it will ultimately be
left behind

476
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,849
back in October of last year Radiohead's
In Rainbows was released on a payment

477
00:28:24,849 --> 00:28:29,720
honor system where fans could set their
own price or pay nothing for the record

478
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,879
now Radiohead was not the first band to
do this contrary to popular belief

479
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:35,710
they're just the first enormously
popular

480
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,720
man to do it but although the exact
figures are the subject of some debate

481
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,440
ghettoize dot com

482
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,480
citing a source close to the band stated
that they sold 1.2 million copies at an

483
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,000
average

484
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,779
eight dollars a copy in the first week
and that comes out to about ten million

485
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,629
dollars in sales

486
00:28:53,629 --> 00:28:57,330
from what I read this was even before
the box set in the physical CD went on

487
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,809
sale

488
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:01,690
now obviously the average working band
isn't going to come anywhere near a

489
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,210
figure like this but it's clear that
this method works for major mainstream

490
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,240
artist with an established fan base

491
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,289
like so many other signs and indicators
that points to the idea that record

492
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:12,490
companies & distributors

493
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:17,539
are becoming obsolete Radiohead proved
that major artists can hone their

494
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,179
masters have virtually no distribute
distribution costs

495
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:24,899
and make their own rules more
importantly though it demonstrates that

496
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:25,970
people

497
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,559
when represented are rather when
presented with a fair display

498
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,320
respect will pay accordingly the people
who bought that record

499
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,950
did so because they appreciated being
given the option of having it for free

500
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,839
if they wanted and a lot of people took
advantage of that ability in downloaded

501
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,928
without paying and that's

502
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,089
okay because the people who felt they
could afford to pay a little for a made

503
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,139
up for those who couldn't

504
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:51,970
this is where I start to draw
comparisons between this new method

505
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,270
distribution

506
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:57,730
and the open source movement the
community maintains its own ability to

507
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,599
access the information

508
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:04,119
thus creating more convenience and
stability for the whole

509
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:07,510
thats mainstream artists but what about
the little guy

510
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,570
well in the interest love answering that
question and helping to promote this new

511
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,658
model that we've been discussing here I
set up to demonstrate that it was in

512
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:15,510
fact

513
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:18,770
entirely possible to create a
full-length record it was entirely

514
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,990
self-produced

515
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,240
and the cost virtually nothing to create

516
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,859
six months or so later it's finished and
here's how I did

517
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,149
first enlisted the help of a few friends
who are supportive of my musical

518
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:34,470
ambitions and who are willing to do what
they could to help me out

519
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:39,089
associating yourself with kind and
generous people can be a valuable

520
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:43,500
resource in situations like this and so
I highly emphasize the important

521
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,399
importance a positive networking for
independent artists

522
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,510
I'm an engineer friend of mine for
example only and an assortment of

523
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,080
microphones and other various mid-range
studio equipment and I used an old

524
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,949
Tascam 4-track cassette recorder is a
mixer

525
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,339
and some software such as audacity to
digitally at the recordings

526
00:31:01,339 --> 00:31:05,029
I made every possible effort to save
money by doing things like making my own

527
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,309
pop filters at my girlfriends pantyhose

528
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:11,918
and using every peaceable equipment I
had

529
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,859
I live in apartments so recording drums
was definitely an obstacle but again

530
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:19,230
a family member help me overcome it by
allowing me to use his basement to track

531
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,750
all the percussion allowed instruments

532
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,980
any parts on the record that need to be
played by musicians other than myself

533
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:29,629
were performed by close friends and mine
that's allowing me to avoid hefty fees

534
00:31:29,629 --> 00:31:34,679
involved with hiring session players
next up at the last three years a trial

535
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,559
in air Education be used by performing
all the mixing in engineering tasks

536
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,500
myself

537
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,799
using what I'm sure are taboo production
techniques that most engineers would

538
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,869
cringe at the site have

539
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:48,609
however I'm proud to say that this
record seems to verify the notion that

540
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:52,730
engineering doesn't necessarily matter
all that much so long as the songs are

541
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:56,250
relatively well composed and
well-executed

542
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,490
that's not to say that sounds shoddy
it'll I've discovered that with enough

543
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,659
patience and going around

544
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,159
it's possible to make the whole thing
sound remarkably cohesive and at times

545
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,109
even indistinguishable from professional
studio recording

546
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:12,700
the means of promoting this record in
accordance with this experiment also had

547
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,240
to be

548
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,339
extremely cheap or completely free so I
use Google pages to create a

549
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:22,339
pretty looking website and bought a
domain name the redirected to it for six

550
00:32:22,339 --> 00:32:23,309
dollars

551
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,149
and I promoted the record on MySpace and
with physical flyers and advertisements

552
00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:28,220
locally

553
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,589
and I also contacted some local web
sites and media outlets for interviewing

554
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:34,730
and other promotional measures which
funneled substantial amounts of traffic

555
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:35,559
to my site

556
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,389
without having to a any sort of large
sum of money

557
00:32:40,389 --> 00:32:43,839
so if you exclude the cost to the
4-track cassette recorder and my PC both

558
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,779
of which I and well before taking on
this project

559
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:50,320
the total cost at making the record came
out to twelve dollars

560
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,320
which I spent on RCA cable at Radio
Shack

561
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:03,349
that means that any money over twelve
dollars that I made from the sale love

562
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,980
this record is directly

563
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,869
into my pocket I can then save that
money and apply it to the funding for my

564
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:11,089
next project which

565
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:15,408
I intend to execute the exact same way
wanna

566
00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:18,710
keep in mind that because the record is
being released entirely in digital

567
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:20,119
format with only a few

568
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,589
limited edition CD pressings being sold
there is no distribution cost

569
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:29,879
not a single penny has to be spent in
manufacturing a physical product

570
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:33,659
not a single penny has to be sent a ship
and package it

571
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:37,669
not a single any although and listening
to the whole thing

572
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:40,999
one would not be able to tell how little
money was spent to make it unless they

573
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:43,460
were really critical engineer

574
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,970
I also say that to extend the
imperfections have the production

575
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,009
Linda certain level up honesty in a
motion to the record

576
00:33:52,009 --> 00:33:56,519
any more mainstream standards you know
where to make your recordings as loud as

577
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,179
possible

578
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:02,559
often at the expense of the credibility
and organic nature of the music itself

579
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,739
there's a noticeable difference between
overproduced squeaky-clean recordings

580
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:10,799
and a natural raw element that I think
the majority of what I call the global

581
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,819
audience is ready and willing even

582
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:18,440
eager to accent if independent artists
begin to utilize this method of creation

583
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,619
that I'm describing I'm hypothesizing
that will all start see more character

584
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:26,919
originality and we all miss emerging
from the artistic for

585
00:34:26,918 --> 00:34:32,158
all as a result let us not forget have
the walls and barriers being broken by

586
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,869
technological advances

587
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:37,460
and their availability to artists with
empty pocketbooks

588
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,149
I find that concept extremely exciting
and moving

589
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:45,290
this is the kind of trend that the
musical community community can really

590
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:48,100
take hold of an embrace and if we do

591
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,850
we've got a real chance at bringing
integrity back to the music

592
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,179
business and it's in the hopes that I
can do my part to push things ever so

593
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,670
slightly in this direction

594
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,450
that I chose to release the album for
free under Creative Commons license that

595
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,980
allows anyone to copy

596
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:07,970
distribute and share my website has been
set up with what I call the digital

597
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,589
gatefold where people can view the
lyrics to all the songs complete with

598
00:35:11,589 --> 00:35:13,310
the links to web-sites that

599
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,569
explain the inspiration for them as well
as view or download the album art this

600
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:21,739
gives the sensation of having a physical
product that you might get from buying a

601
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,779
CD

602
00:35:22,779 --> 00:35:26,940
but its advance more highly involved in
the sense that

603
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,170
with the you know capabilities have the
Internet

604
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:34,170
one can go deeper and deeper and deeper
into the liner notes

605
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,549
this is something you can do with a
piece of paper

606
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:40,839
they can download the album and or
stream it if they like it

607
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,900
a and if they have a book to spare they
can donate it to fund my next project or

608
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,080
don't

609
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,140
that's fine too if they don't like it
they can have the satisfaction of

610
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,470
hearing that paper crackling noise from
the Recycle Bin without feeling any

611
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,160
regard

612
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,720
regrets if having spent money on

613
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,609
I've admired and respected for years
what the tech community can do to keep

614
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:04,299
us all moving towards a better

615
00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:08,640
and a brighter future and I'm very
grateful to the energy and the talent

616
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,670
it's been channeled into creating
something is revolutionary in so

617
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,880
beneficial to the audible art form

618
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,549
as the peer to peer system so in closing
offer a final prediction

619
00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:23,960
the image which gives me a great deal
hope and optimism

620
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,310
I predict that in 25 years to recover
the record industry as we know it today

621
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,670
will be a laughable

622
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:33,770
legend we will have won the war and the
CEO's with packed their briefcases and

623
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:36,160
Bo tox kids and fled like your own
inspector

624
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,399
LA which will quickly sink into the
pacific ocean under the weight of their

625
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,730
massive egos and pocketbooks

626
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,830
with a splendid in long overdue celebra
Tory

627
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:51,830
splash

628
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:58,089
group suburban kids and their parents
garage banging away on their

629
00:36:58,089 --> 00:37:01,540
untamed instruments will look to
themselves rather than MTV for

630
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,119
inspiration

631
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,720
to make their music and I'll give it to
anyone who wants to hear it

632
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,060
these artists have the future will
accept that once they've created and

633
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,230
released their work of art in the world
for all to interpret

634
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:17,529
it becomes the property of the
collective audience

635
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:20,750
and not readily push the boundaries of
the conventional perception

636
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,400
what can be done with that

637
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,619
I predicted at the ashes at the
entertainment conglomerate will come

638
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:31,630
a new generation of artists who create
music based on their own refined tastes

639
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:34,170
and influence is drawn from their own
moral

640
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:38,180
and philosophical observations he will
usher in a creative a weakening

641
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:41,660
for all and perhaps most importantly

642
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,319
music fans have this future will seek
out exciting new sounds and build a new

643
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:50,830
user supported pseudo industry based
around the principles of the open source

644
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,739
movement which is proving to be a more
efficient

645
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:59,290
effective and highly involved means
sharing information within our society

646
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,770
and I predict that this ongoing audience
as well as the Sun morn artists

647
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,790
will all be grateful to us for their
ability to do so in a way so brilliantly

648
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:11,650
masterfully you the seeds

649
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:16,600
the leeches the developers have sent a
clear message to the suits

650
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:20,239
who have attempted to force feed you
their shallow pre chewed

651
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,009
candy-coated product that they are
unwelcome in our hearts

652
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:27,540
our minds are homes in our headphones

653
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:32,400
and in doing so you're paying an
unprecedented homage to Mozart

654
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,130
Beethoven Chopin lead barely Woody
Guthrie

655
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,880
John Cage Duke Ellington John Lennon
Brian Wilson Bob Dylan Frank Zappa David

656
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,759
Byrne and everyone else was dedicated
their life

657
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:49,080
to furthering our perception of what it
means to make sounds

658
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,029
the development and use peer to peer
technology is more than a trend

659
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:56,989
and it's more than a movement its
justice

660
00:38:56,989 --> 00:39:02,810
the solemn tribute likes of which have
never been paid such a remarkable extent

661
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:07,549
I'm certain that his peers you go down
in history as the heroes

662
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:11,290
VAW and took back mankind's hijacked
music

663
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:14,810
who set free the spirit varney creative
instinct

664
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,989
to make for a more glorious and
beautiful celebration of the world

665
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:22,190
we may use as the Palin for creating
peace

666
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:25,690
love human brotherhood and social
progress

667
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:32,690
thank you very much

668
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,740
17 at the floor now to anyone who has
any questions or comments or anything

669
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,100
they'd like to share

670
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:47,390
decorated thank you

671
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,540
already

672
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:57,520
up

673
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,460
is

674
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,900
is

675
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,230
or K

676
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:16,230
home

677
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,020
how so are were

678
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:32,890
is

679
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:39,790
its p

680
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:45,480
day

681
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,860
wise

682
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:52,740
sure

683
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:59,039
but technically as you put me on the
spot %uh

684
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,019
I understand what you're saying
absolutely and its

685
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:09,089
its it is possible that through
malicious regulation I consider it to be

686
00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:09,880
malicious

687
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,299
on with the yeah it's it's malicious

688
00:41:13,299 --> 00:41:17,140
it's downright dirty an evil rate on

689
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:21,839
however what I've witnessed through just
observing the open source movement is

690
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:22,259
that

691
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,839
you know what we've got here for example
is a

692
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:29,740
crowd of people you know drew that is
willing

693
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,910
to stay on the underground below that
regulation or above depending on how you

694
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,890
choose to look at it

695
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:41,230
and make sure that although they may try
to regulated as they have already

696
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,250
that they will fail and it now have more
confidence

697
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:47,349
myself and I'm sure you do too I'm not
challenging year you know

698
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:50,760
your integrity in the least but I have
more confidence in

699
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,900
the hacker community than I do in the
abilities

700
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:58,880
the government or any special interests
to regulate something is profound

701
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,880
wide-ranging as the internet certainly

702
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,460
absolutely that's what I mean that's
what we're all doing here I think is a

703
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,710
is manifesting that fight advertising in
little bit

704
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,420
and making ourselves known to those you
know

705
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:24,420
powers-that-be to say that we're we're
not going to stand for that

706
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:32,349
good

707
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,630
the

708
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:39,730
or

709
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,810
said

710
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,490
certainly said

711
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,590
said

712
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:56,200
of certainly absolutely and the
difference i think between

713
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,300
music and a movie for example

714
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,490
is that saddam the quality of the
product

715
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,609
you know if they make a movie in my
bedroom for example it's probably

716
00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:10,200
not going to look very good assuming
that you know I'm using mid-range

717
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,650
equipment as I did with this record that
I was referring to

718
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,940
on and so there's a little bit have the

719
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,000
a discretion when it comes to music that
you can almost mask it as a professional

720
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,940
recording without it being one wrist

721
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,670
extremely difficult to do so with movies
software on the other hand is very

722
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,200
similar

723
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,920
very similar on yes I have considered it

724
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,490
but my area of expertise is music and

725
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,660
I don't know anything about making a
movie I don't know anything about

726
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,118
writing software

727
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:41,280
and so I'm shouldn't you know take the
liberty

728
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,970
commenting on that without you know
being educated on a completely but I

729
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,960
completely understand what you're saying
and I agree

730
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,900
entire thank you his

731
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:57,810
your thank you

732
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,250
and all

733
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,569
1

734
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:05,640
in

735
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:11,490
me certain of

736
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,850
sure

737
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,370
here

738
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,940
you know min

739
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,940
it's important yeah all

740
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,280
your rains and

741
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,480
your used

742
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,870
record so morning

743
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:45,870
did him

744
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,560
your be

745
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,890
and

746
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,750
the

747
00:44:56,750 --> 00:45:00,300
and for me

748
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,620
Chur that's a good point

749
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,730
and what I what I always talk about when
when people bring this up

750
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:10,980
is that the reason we refer to bands
like Radiohead or the Beatles or

751
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,650
Pink Floyd whoever you know it's because
they were groundbreaking it was because

752
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,470
they did something that had not

753
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,750
been done before they moved
progressively

754
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,340
in a direction that elevated the global
audience

755
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:26,560
to a point where we had been before and
so I think that

756
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,900
quality in this system

757
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,830
plays a huge part where is in the
current system it doesn't necessarily

758
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,990
play a part

759
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:37,560
you know they can use like I refer to
earlier the answer as Autotune plugin

760
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,040
just

761
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:41,470
you know throw some pretty little girl
is studio and all the sudden she's a

762
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:43,360
musician in the caller an artist

763
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,480
rate now if we start to embrace this
system

764
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,210
I think that the crap so to speak will
wean itself

765
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:55,980
out I mean there's not going to be more
crap as a result of this is already out

766
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,530
there

767
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,190
there will always be garbage right but
the good stuff

768
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,070
the really good stuff I think it's
possible in this system

769
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:08,280
for that to take hold were in the other
system it is and so I I see this is the

770
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,040
only hope we've got for that

771
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,240
on to address your question about the
time involved with making the record I

772
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:14,790
spent

773
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,120
over a hundred hours a studio time me
personally

774
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,500
doing everything involved with the
production at the record on

775
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:27,300
and yes time as they say is money right
what I found is that I've managed to

776
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,460
worked 40 hours a week on still doing
this

777
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:33,560
in my spare time off and you know up
until 8 a.m.

778
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,060
in the morning to do it um you know then

779
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,970
I did have an opportunity I got my
stimulus check from the government which

780
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,620
really came in handy because I could
take some time off work

781
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,580
I didn't use that money to go directly
into the production of the record

782
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,790
this bike women or anything like that I
simply

783
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:53,880
paid my bills with it so that I can
afford to take a little bit of time off

784
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,430
and focus a little bit more time

785
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:59,240
um if you can save a little bit of money
take a week off

786
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,090
and just you know go balls to the wall
in just do it

787
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,980
and that's one way of avoiding that
scenario where your time

788
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,100
is costing you a lot %uh money and I
completely understand

789
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:13,800
absolutely what you're saying it's a
difficult task to manage between working

790
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,660
so much

791
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,500
and having this project that's going to
take you a long time now if you've got

792
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,980
five guys in the band

793
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,540
and you guys can each split you know the

794
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:28,350
responsibilities to an extent the knack
unsorted minimize the time the each

795
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,020
individual respected member has to spend

796
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:34,500
on that now I don't have a band and so
on just got it in my own

797
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,850
Boat paddling quickly so and BS

798
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:42,710
good point definitely thank you I R E

799
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:49,710
sure

800
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,069
okay I knew somebody was gonna bring
that up and what the Radiohead to me

801
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:56,499
their intentions

802
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,869
in releasing their record I can't
comment on because I'm not a member of

803
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:00,460
the band

804
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,569
however the what it demonstrates

805
00:48:03,569 --> 00:48:06,940
is independent i rly from the intention
to begin with

806
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:10,039
I'm so they did you know cancel the
digital download right

807
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,599
and I believe their manager came right
out and said you know this was a

808
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,920
marketing thing you know we're

809
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:18,190
were trying to push this out there were
doing something new on

810
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,680
but regardless if that Metallica could
have done the exact same thing if they

811
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,640
made ten million dollars in the first
week

812
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,859
yeah absolutely any begun disorder
embrace that

813
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:30,069
that ideology that they were so
adamantly against before

814
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:37,069
am but like I said meant okay

815
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,960
well in what sense do you mean
distributing through as far as I can

816
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,670
an individual company okay well yeah but
I mean that's definitely that's a huge

817
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,220
factor in the whole idea to begin with

818
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,050
I mean the peer to peer system and it's
detrimental effect

819
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,170
as they say includes that factor

820
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,290
as well as you know your IP laws and
things like that

821
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:07,740
but you know I'm not saying that I don't
believe I feel awesome

822
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,390
fear I just believe that if we want
integrity to be restored to the music

823
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:15,930
industry we need to embrace things like
Creative Commons from an artistic level

824
00:49:15,930 --> 00:49:20,359
where we can set our own rules rather
than just generalizing in making

825
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:22,770
everyone who wants to hear without
paying a criminal

826
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:28,180
good

827
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,868
a you know they won't let me rules and
the new system the your head I'm not you

828
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:37,160
my care

829
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:41,109
I don't care what other people listen to
enjoy you can enjoy crap if you want

830
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:48,110
but you know

831
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,080
right

832
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,020
well i mean i cant are you can you can
wear that question is what do I care if

833
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:00,490
people vote for President Bush it's
something that I feel passionately about

834
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:03,700
and that's something you know I advocate
this system

835
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,940
because my life is centered entirely
around

836
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:10,750
the art form on and so if someone comes
out

837
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,160
and you know makes a record in calls
himself an artist

838
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:20,549
on say so

839
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:25,030
is someone was just okay got one million
address really quick

840
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,040
I'm not one sees did you find who is
Marcus

841
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,009
is however I can to find the value of
the quality for myself and not you or

842
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:34,520
anybody else but for me

843
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,940
if I hear Miley Cirus record that's
garbage its absolute garbage in as

844
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:42,700
no artistic merit because it is designed
and promoted

845
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,490
solely to sell units it's not there to
do

846
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,960
anything to benefit the art form that I
live for so that's why scrap

847
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,290
to me the

848
00:50:54,290 --> 00:51:01,290
it's like I've got to okay if

849
