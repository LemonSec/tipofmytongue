1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,360
strains with the key

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,580
sets it seems like a bad idea that's
right have been adduced

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,099
I got hooked up with with 50 at that
point people said to me

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:16,500
well if you talk to win if you can go
secure phone he'll like then you've

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,760
you've solved the problem

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,289
okay well meanwhile three companies
later and

7
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:25,480
several million dollars were telling
okay we're secure farms as per request

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,300
topic for today broadens the initial I'm

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,250
test why yeah our

10
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,860
my name to hold hope I'm saddam just
fine in company common age 6

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,210
there's much more on what we do a hard
to do that seeks

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,989
in the same room I whatever project
season security 11

13
00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:50,590
a the project and this is how we got in
touch with

14
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:55,170
events company stardom which was also
doing secure telephone switches probably

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,359
more prudent to their talks about his
part of the story first provoking

16
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,489
to what we're doing to okay so

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:05,890
I me disco tonight who's actually used
to secure

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,479
on your many time there's 23 you know
terrier who was okay

19
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,610
let's I'm your scanner secured

20
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:17,500
telephony 101 miss model applies
independent whether to go over

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,189
the switch from network or IP so

22
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:26,200
got the classic Alice and Bob we always
problem he got some bad

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,350
telephone here and they want to talk to
each other

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,500
and there's this clout

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,610
that's you know medium-term top iraqis
in Amsterdam on the moderate

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,689
and we've got so the eavesdroppers
little

27
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,790
and the assumption that we may just sit
in the civil case the eavesdroppers a

28
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,200
passive eavesdropper

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,490
so has access to all the bits that the
chance back and forth

30
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,390
to the next level of threat visit the
eavesdropper can actually

31
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,780
mando that the bitstream between us
again sir

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,960
insert bites drop by its smash bites

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,860
anything like that so do you know the
basic idea here is what we're saying

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,110
okay this is a digital world

35
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,419
I've got my phone I gotta somehow
digitizer

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,180
and then I want to do something crypto
nothing on it and then I go into this

37
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,489
might get some kind of modem mmm go to
digitize

38
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:21,690
unit PSTN basically out the others

39
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,870
I another modem my

40
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,890
my team I other girl and then back to
the farm

41
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:33,980
so that's the in the simplest case
probably totally logical but bottom line

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,910
is I gotta digitizes speech

43
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,220
I don't jam across a bit by and I've
gotta get back out there and Andy

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,250
cryptic couple problems come up right
away one of which is a fight just sorta

45
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,629
take

46
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,090
telephone quality voice and I just use
it

47
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,450
if I deal with the way the phone company
deals with that I guess 64 kilobytes

48
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,580
channel and most modems won't need 64

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,739
kilobits even tell you know anything
away particularly interested in working

50
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,650
in it really kinda harsh environment as
a military people who say they say

51
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,769
operating on ships is really hostile

52
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:07,790
but operating across a while sleeping is
also

53
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,409
so we ended up with a slightly revised
picture

54
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:14,450
just kind where the reality with this
problem comes and

55
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,540
which looks at them and show 1 and you
so I've got

56
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,810
a a/d converter on one and I've got

57
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,330
DA converter in and out

58
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,409
got compress okay decompress

59
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,829
and now I've got

60
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,360
its a something critical

61
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,069
here and I got my modem

62
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,519
then I really good usually there somehow
marks happening here

63
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,420
because I got some control styles
related to call setup city at the key

64
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,140
material

65
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,590
then I'm out here to my the modem can be
buried in the radio this

66
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,980
if I'm working overall digital cell
phone-based for the modem is in the

67
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,379
south

68
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,319
so for the game plan here is in the
steady-state case you gotta

69
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,459
you got this question about how do I
insert the key

70
00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:09,900
between each side so the general
strategy everybody's using his

71
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,250
is I don't governments I'm trying to
build a box it's inexpensive

72
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,000
more than likely what it is I don't want
to have to make the box tamper-resistant

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,240
I don't want to be a thing were filed
drop it or lose it

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,990
install either jojoba oil in the truck
so we we we want

75
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,990
bill a system based to generate a new
key

76
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,400
every time they come from call so to do
that we use the diffie-hellman

77
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,259
exponential key exchange

78
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:38,740
if you get time I can run through that
people know this is

79
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,820
okay so the the shorthand version is

80
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,120
be back at the Alice and Bob picture it
turns out that is Alice and Bob

81
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,820
send messages back and forth in each
other takes like two roundtrips Eve can

82
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,330
watch everything going on

83
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,669
and you had miraculously Alice and Bob
come up with a key is shared between

84
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:56,990
them that he doesn't have

85
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,610
turns out that is fairly straightforward
Matthew modular exponentiation

86
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:08,039
and it works so the bottom line here is
I got some a/d converter I compress

87
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:12,340
and typically we compress down to
something like either 14400 as per

88
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,940
second

89
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,660
or 96 escort for 800 there's a whole
buncha trade us here on the on the voice

90
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,530
compression the comp kodak's which is
sometimes confused to the

91
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,240
the same ones used in both my hands but
in the Codex

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,960
basically the trade-off how many minutes
it takes for work and bandwidth

93
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,039
for what kinda sound quality is carolyn
was picking two

94
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,229
problem and then there's some %uh come
on come to the budget but Japan's

95
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,520
on the crypt are pretty much you got to
go into effect on going on here one

96
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,120
which is the traffic there which is
let's assume I've somehow

97
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,740
re Aki me sometime crypto didn't pick
the stuff

98
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,650
generally what we end up running today
Tues two minutes is

99
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,460
be key the the devices like the overall

100
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,380
DDD yes and I built to the stuff that
the freeze one guys are currently using

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,100
which was built the first companies

102
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,270
fuck black boxes but I like modems and I
got

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,940
home some story in unity of gasoline on
maybe a little demo of here

104
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,969
don't don't whole right please up

105
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,120
somebody river into this please return
to meet and

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,910
this the first time to consider
understand what you're looking at is a

107
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,319
device that goes between

108
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,009
handset and the phone dates with design
center between them

109
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,449
the phone in the wall was designed that
way so they could work with

110
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,360
ISDN vodafone said the PBX proprietors

111
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,000
as Wade auto configure it does the
diffie-hellman over 2k that modular

112
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,560
cylinders TTT yes

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,810
uses here that for a GSM herder calpers
appall

114
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:47,120
before the okay that's fair though the
hand way the explanation

115
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,590
of crypto short history the for secure
phone I'm

116
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,090
and feel free to ask questions and white
and those are the ones on

117
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,410
posture power yeah

118
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,030
my catch up on the mic the silos I was
going for the title

119
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,270
regarding exchanges said its independent
or

120
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,099
do it on we do we do that we do the
diffie-hellman to

121
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:14,039
to the two ends artists from parties and
the anticipated do you have an upcoming

122
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:17,620
defeat on the bottom and that also
desperately

123
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,849
%uh delighted talked about how we defend
against it on my

124
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,969
and rule pressed for time I run home
after she defends against the whole

125
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,270
thing

126
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,698
K but i wanna try to get some other
stuff K okay

127
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,970
I'm it's a little bit so the first
secure phone I have no

128
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,210
was actually will head towards the end
of world war two excellent Churchill and

129
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:37,949
Roosevelt

130
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:42,139
they they had this huge think it was one
of those know here's the room across

131
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,160
from here to there

132
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,569
racket here there was a one-time pad
system based on what phonograph record

133
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,180
to date specially built like

134
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,180
phonograph records a limit to how many
thanks to meet 30

135
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,930
and they'd ship you know one day england
won the Washington

136
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,039
and it was a spare and what they had to
do is a key these two

137
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:03,639
records of its own way to synchronize
them and then they could go on have I

138
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:06,340
think about 30 min conversation

139
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,110
the Boudreau secure delivery from the
very beginning with military coups

140
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,449
people really wanted the same thing as
folks now what is your ideal have

141
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,370
absolutely private conversation you know

142
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,990
at the distance I i think is personally
with my motivation for this whole thing

143
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,550
was as I would like

144
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,539
the phone private conversations and your

145
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,270
with me we would kind of like let's go
take a look around I'm going to go take

146
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,819
a look

147
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,419
in walk in the woods kinda hard here in
Manhattan but I can't we go would rather

148
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,208
go take a walk in the woods we say on
what to say

149
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:40,200
we come back I want that kind of

150
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,019
basically intimacy that kind of freedom
to say what I wanted to say

151
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,140
and not have to be physically located
next to people this is my personal goal

152
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,550
on this whole thing about what people
want

153
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,510
and you know i've been accused today in
professional cared or not that is just

154
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:53,920
like a

155
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,370
you know I'm why shouldn't I be able to
have a private conversation

156
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:00,790
yes it's like very simple their

157
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,640
I'm the next for the next

158
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,860
really secure phones in history
basically came up with this dude jus

159
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,160
which actually haven't seen I think
they're still deployed nato in Europe

160
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,339
right now and then primarily what's
currently has a look at what's 23 secure

161
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,360
telephone unit

162
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,810
third edition and others with this team
never

163
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,660
deployed stews really looks like I'll
telephone feature

164
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,050
desk phone motorola's a really care big
clunky in heavy their cast aluminum

165
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,399
million you open them up

166
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,459
three separate layers & Poor's their
designed by two

167
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:37,850
wilder section seven separate processors
they're really

168
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,899
hardcore need separate power supplies it
got arm

169
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,019
like a hook switch for the car there's
actually four separate

170
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:48,180
my purse which is in there is also a
tendency to make sure that when it's on

171
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:48,740
the

172
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:53,240
really on the hook in this season will
be is redesigned the people who knew

173
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,600
I'm as commercial guys want to build
something that we could actually I

174
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,140
delete the other the Holy Grail is a
hundred dollars secure pharmacist

175
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,230
good three dollars it's okay to get some
people thousand bucks

176
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,250
2500 which is what most was that you'll
find it's like yeah there's a few people

177
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,459
but we noticed that there are hard to
find I'm

178
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:15,850
we spent a lot of many years contract in
discussions

179
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,180
then there's some some commercial phones
entered the market watchers asylum

180
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:24,200
unit which again was them into the
building

181
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,660
late eighties it had like three gabs
peas and

182
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,269
sounded actually get a big in Cloquet
and anything that really revolutionize

183
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,579
the

184
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,870
all for the commercial marketplace was
AT&T

185
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,720
was really the same guys will involve
the designs to injury the NSA

186
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,230
built using that was called the TST 3600

187
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,480
the for it wasn't that will enhance our
core it

188
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,829
did single DES encryption and this came
out but may meet you

189
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:54,950
is really pretty amazing and I got

190
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,310
few home and they I'm they were

191
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,550
this done pretty good they use don't
know about forty eight hundred feet per

192
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:01,970
second

193
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,050
vocoder the working pretty harsh
environment they didn't have a clue GE

194
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,630
James Bond bad phone which had like an
old car

195
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:13,649
'em apartment at like that jail cell and
it had

196
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,230
an Audiovox amps car transceiver unit

197
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,920
came a lot to the same it had for the
inconvenience at all and work in a

198
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
certain cells

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,899
of telephones a little models at the
plant that was it that was the product

200
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,110
they actually

201
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,310
basically in vote that provoked

202
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,120
the whole thing with the clipper chip to
happen is AT&T

203
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,490
know they're being it's the same guys
against in three days ago talked about

204
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:39,740
his

205
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,100
in essence a hey we're looking to do
this in a low-security

206
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,270
first communications in the US and the
boys go who that's a good idea

207
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,500
boom let's see if we got an idea for you

208
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,630
in the end so what actually happened at
that point is that they

209
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,790
the redesigned the box same form factor
the said there was now

210
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,020
this clipper chip that that is had this
feature that

211
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,949
transmit the keys to the Fed wasn't used
to classify algorithms a little bit

212
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:06,970
outside people today

213
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,390
years have gone by and it turned out was
skipjack and yeah it's been

214
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,060
nah people know how it works as much as
the keychain job with still classified

215
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,670
pretty much people have a pretty good
idea how just for

216
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,279
first principles help a

217
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,890
but that's where the real shot
themselves in the foot no commercial

218
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,689
people won't

219
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,390
in fact offer how they did for they had
a few customers it had these the single

220
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,350
destination

221
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,110
and they are they are they wanted them
all back and then they were going to

222
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,800
quote upgrade you unquote

223
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,260
you know and and there can be no more to
support a single does one so those are

224
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,899
really quite

225
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,680
nice long flight is at right now people
that I know they had purchased the move

226
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,399
them certainly would send him back to
the upgrades

227
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,050
know this bottle the other was just a
just a did

228
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:57,230
I creditors in about 1990 1993 this
project an outfit

229
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:02,310
about two years fair enough for my
ground 0 how does secure phones is

230
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,350
get nervous before there was a voice
over IP you know

231
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,819
just don't spend much time Berkeley
engineering library reading too much

232
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,349
stuff and talking to people

233
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,440
talking with the themes in front gene
really doesn't want to take

234
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,880
tell me the script or so re on

235
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,399
so we got some boxes a sold fewer firm
against goal-line

236
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,550
okay hang are hardly use who wants to
use them in responding to the next

237
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,329
company which is very much as the device
that you were sending around

238
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,860
again targeted for some other place
couple lessons we learned this and

239
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,220
come by my words of wisdom is what I
found so far as a people really

240
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,990
long pay much for crypto there are few
people who will say yeah I'll pay five

241
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,959
thousand dollars for

242
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,180
but he actually turned up a business
plan together that's going take

243
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,610
risk dole in Hartford is always an
expensive proposition which in your

244
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,339
business plan

245
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:56,240
really me servicemen at this point I
haven't found

246
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,779
with secure phones my my personal Holy
Grail was really

247
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:05,069
to get all the pic don't mean to us all
into the device that all he really like

248
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:06,470
my office I don't have where

249
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,959
disliking I get DSL himself on my way
long

250
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,370
time one second the problem the children
at the box a secure from

251
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,290
nothing into I'm to learn some lessons
about that one of which is there at all

252
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:22,630
inconvenient people won't use this is
the same story I got from talking

253
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,319
to military museums instance reason
they're even more in community using

254
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,490
that all commercial stuff because it
given key management no is

255
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:33,209
things at all in convening people whose
to sleep quality

256
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,730
you have a hard time this offer people
don't use it as a closing files with it

257
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,079
know it's its anything in the morning
news this is a

258
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,300
my world mycology her

259
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,130
on does things I don't think the people
wanna

260
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,160
cheaper free so there's an opportunity
here somewhere for

261
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,089
they can open source version morning
leading to be expensive hardware

262
00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:57,529
muddy have again you got a good game's
most

263
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,770
questions yeah

264
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,120
to stand by please yeah liza

265
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,870
I remember is a member the attempt to
basically use Juno

266
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,990
workers a computers for secure voice
communication namely pgp phone

267
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,079
and it had the clever thing for a

268
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,140
demand paclitaxel and

269
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:24,000
know anything on speed on that issue
Charles auto that you want to but you

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,730
can follow him

271
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,480
the phone was an attempt by yeltsin many
most creative

272
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,439
the email for sure that the Texters the

273
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:38,110
I'm to create a secure telephone using
IP telephony

274
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,550
and what they did is basically the same
thing

275
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:45,470
that's happening here HID conversion
compression

276
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,880
and then instead of sending over a month
and telephone line it was sent over the

277
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,860
Internet

278
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,680
to the other side in I'm his number of
reasons why that never went anywhere

279
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,829
but they also didn't ever system way
where list either

280
00:15:58,829 --> 00:16:02,689
words for hex digits on either side

281
00:16:02,689 --> 00:16:06,279
and his this would be Jonesboro

282
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:09,770
knowing for sure that the NSA would be
in the middle to have these devices

283
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,910
that's man in middle attack its that
everybody's been talking about this

284
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,819
what happens if the NEC in the middle
with to have these devices

285
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,930
that autonomously set up some kind of
magic key

286
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,589
then they can negotiated he with each
side

287
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,630
and just want the analog parts together
and have the phone off

288
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:32,290
and the thing to a property in the
office diffie-hellman magic thing that

289
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,600
we're talking about

290
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,860
is what happens

291
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,510
you can make sure we got it is
impossible for the fourth

292
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:42,860
the person in the middle man

293
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,240
middle median same way it's impossible
to

294
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,380
negotiate the scene he was both parties
so they would actually

295
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,900
be forced to negotiate the thinking is
each party and by

296
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,010
how she hear the ocean so hard that
leads to the key

297
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:01,000
and and displaying a number of digits
you can make sure that if these two

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,170
people can verify

299
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:06,270
over the phone using the voice can
verify that these digits are the same on

300
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,310
both their displays

301
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,010
that there is no man in the middle and
of course there's still the possibility

302
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,129
of them

303
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,710
sitting lying each composition meeting
with the boys impersonators

304
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,190
going events it now and break the voice

305
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,610
and and say different things on these
two lines but it would make it

306
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,860
incredibly hard and it would make it
impossible to do that

307
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,950
in or near impossible to do that in

308
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,240
anything real time to this is this man

309
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,370
little potential but anyway PG be
incorporated

310
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,530
DVD for nasa side project arduous

311
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,610
conveniently have sidetracked

312
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:47,150
a when any I and which

313
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,660
by coincidence is a major defense
contractor bought EPA

314
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,150
I guess that's that's unwitting

315
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,000
Italy's never went anywhere is the same
is there's other things which do the

316
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
same thing there's

317
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,899
speak freely which is really nice it
doesn't have the G

318
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,020
dizzy home in Santa to be deceiving to
put in to YouTube password

319
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:10,220
said that on pgp or something but our

320
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,730
there's a number of other tools out
there there there's a standard for IP

321
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,540
telephony h323

322
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,790
there's ways of securing that you can
even run that over

323
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:25,350
running has IP say main problem I IP
telephony is a whole never went anywhere

324
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,470
is that people

325
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,150
don't necessarily said that their
computer are ready to launch

326
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,100
applications

327
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:36,000
at the time phone rings so people want
to talk to you in a camp for each

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
individual

329
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,850
computer is not online we can compete
you don't kill your computer

330
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,740
this will all go away when we have
instantaneous fast IP connections in our

331
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,400
pockets

332
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,390
is a next-generation selling phones at
which point all these things converge

333
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,060
backing

334
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,090
this is another reason is not just any I
buying

335
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,030
he's being it's also IP telephony is a
whole never going

336
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:01,000
moving in with the problem with PGP
phone has it really it sounded pretty

337
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,120
good you are looking at work but it
didn't work well

338
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,700
it also has a new user interface
problems using conventional modem

339
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:12,610
so the required you had to know the call
was coming in at home now I have to push

340
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,890
this button on the receiver

341
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,420
opposes nooo so there is a budget again
this isn't about things

342
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:21,910
hard user inconvenient use part of why
we

343
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,290
bill hardware that this is specific to
this thing if you want to be able to use

344
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,940
it anyway

345
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,740
phone you want to call to come in will
be in the clergy hello

346
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,490
and then you know maybe I'm talking to
my mother she doesn't have a secure

347
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,800
or maybe and now I'm talking to you does
way that

348
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,010
that the 888 isn't units were was just
one party or the other press

349
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,350
the Big Green go secure button and the
other end

350
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,370
noticed mad discussions to kill so
against bankers

351
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,970
but usable no question yeah

352
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,090
I wonder if you mind giving the castle
summary about digital cell phones

353
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,720
what kinda crypto use 100 eavesdropping

354
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,690
the my defended slow motion with some of
my favorite Lansing

355
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,800
so the yeah so in the US

356
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,419
we've got GSM cell phones we have the
highest 136 authenticity anyone those

357
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,150
are the ones in 20 TG levels

358
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:21,150
his employees and then others to see in
a month I seventy-five the I S one

359
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,270
thirty six months

360
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,850
home for the longest time I they they
have

361
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:30,000
the misread the specification is an
opportunity for greater demand for

362
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,960
one's privacy the terms other than a
reasonably good job protecting the

363
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:34,950
billing information

364
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,070
so for the push for the so happens in my
family so

365
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,280
was a huge fart problem ansel because
although

366
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,310
billing information was sent clear this
is what the phone problems

367
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,800
so we pretty much 5th 6th ed as far as I
can tell I don't hear them here the

368
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,940
operators complain that really was a
token gesture

369
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,310
on what they were due to provide voice
privacy in again this would also just

370
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,750
have been between the mobile in the bay
station

371
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,800
to that of course is in the clear across
the public switched telephone network

372
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,610
admin

373
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,990
them back in it turns out that the crib
with respect to this thing was a fixed

374
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,680
mask he was exhort across the gym locker
frame

375
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,110
never change to know about this 160 bit
while both whose name we haven't fixed

376
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,770
mast

377
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,300
you know who cares either general makes
no difference nothing to know that the

378
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,930
phones

379
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,290
brown with what's called discontinuous
transmission so that at the moon you

380
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,500
stop talking

381
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,910
there's like three vocoder frames that
are statistically silence

382
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,050
in the things not present so i cant he
was there to watch

383
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,190
I was watching watching watching is
always that reasoning that means is this

384
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,570
is the last three frames were silence

385
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:43,450
which gets me Klondike in just a few
back with another structure the vocal

386
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,110
mended me right back to close enough to

387
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,150
what the values are because it affects
excellence that I can solve another

388
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,450
no know what the frame looks like more
less a minute with a look at the big

389
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:55,880
deal

390
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:00,300
thing the brokerages design work in the
president also there's gonna be miss

391
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,780
feature which was that the

392
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,899
it for your corrections on the wrong
thing the printer miss

393
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,000
so kg it seems that bush doesn't this
goes back through the history of talk to

394
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,260
people who are at these meetings and
standards the state it was said

395
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,250
is a classic home unsa

396
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,860
making recommendations to the cell phone
company the times has it in for the crew

397
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,380
to expose used up same

398
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,920
wow you know he ought to have that
problem with that

399
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,330
X you'll be able to sell that AA team
plays I

400
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,750
I suggest you make these changes says he
and his mother is exiting also

401
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,910
I'm up until I've been looking for
ninety eight years

402
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,990
and I'm somebody finally told me they
actually seen a base station that

403
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,150
accepted the request to the handset to
him

404
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:48,640
to go to his friends in if we make a
difference anyway

405
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,030
I we looked all over the US missing me

406
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,700
we finally somebody reported yes they
found while in one location base station

407
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,360
accepts the hinsons request hansen

408
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,930
you can configure your phone say
enhanced was privacy

409
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,960
you place the parliament is warning be
home with friends now available to

410
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,540
mention turn-of-the-century

411
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,700
home place in the congress see I played
this tournament wasteful

412
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,320
she's subscribe to that kinda K
something trent lott

413
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,389
she's like turn this thing off been for
the past

414
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:19,610
sorry now that I've heard that is true
that simple as that the

415
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,700
I S 136 stuff this is the this the
sprint spectrum

416
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,890
now I'm the things that I passing

417
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:31,880
II the you know it's a game for his gun
for a little bit He

418
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,880
you no evidence I hope huge number of
combinations that all is well turns out

419
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,250
that

420
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:40,720
version which is from the base station
to the mall

421
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,950
it turns out there's only six before
spreading codes used there no

422
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,290
so that get the building ready to quit
many basically you can receive all

423
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,420
updates

424
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,440
so there's no problem in finding the
dates from

425
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,500
from them the station to the mall

426
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,460
know the trend is OG look at this year
in the specification ago

427
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,780
this looks like it's got some problems
just like a whole lot attendants

428
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,620
England's

429
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,840
and you also look at the quote crypto
function unquote

430
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,470
and yes interns as linear function my

431
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,640
we have redundancy in the signal and you
know your function work in terms our

432
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,430
that you will look at Eldora turns out
you can send a

433
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,340
42 operations in forty two unknowns and
and this is the new in the season 2

434
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,459
so the unknowns 0 you know it's it NC 42
measures 12 and under his office in no

435
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,650
time

436
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,390
if the guy isn't talking with you happen
to look it turns out in getting one

437
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,280
localism

438
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,720
and he's talking heads maximum one
second

439
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,280
to gather in a day what the difference
is is that they

440
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,940
the there's a steel 24 bits in in the
frame

441
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,520
and how they feel 24 there are 16 bits
that are subject to getting the randomly

442
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,560
smash

443
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,010
it communicates in power control
information to him a bit on 24 June

444
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,490
captures what it takes

445
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:05,890
halting the whole second again d yeah
the other piece in The

446
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,610
cellular telephony conspiracy theory
thing is that

447
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,020
there's a pattern issue to home ATG
recent surge in reeds

448
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,320
that was the fix this problem and his
patten's but

449
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,580
written and submitted prior to the I S
nine bystanders

450
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,790
even being accepted so I was like this
problem isn't problems no

451
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,870
know the cycle of course the intimacy
Qualcomm he has brought no kidding yes

452
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,100
more people didn't break anything from
you

453
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,990
so that's the word almost didn't know
the GSM well as far as we know it is

454
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,890
actually holding up pretty well

455
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:39,980
I'm there are 77 tax

456
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,430
I don't know that I personally don't
have anybody that's been off the air

457
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,220
attack

458
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,870
was the one to take some 270 gigabytes
worth it disk space which opposed to

459
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,290
you know I think it takes missed three
hundred books and he bought one in six

460
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,590
minutes with a date or something and
it's more data

461
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,750
I just personally don't think is wrong
with that can say that it's doable

462
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,400
the other thing is that the the Sims the
vast majority is in the eighty percent

463
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,240
of them

464
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,620
have the low 10 low tendency that he had
a general

465
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,710
do sources on over were helping to get

466
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,850
so that's that's another thing on the
GSM I know that this is the way they do

467
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,190
it UK

468
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:19,540
is a although they air interfaces
infected the back hall from the cell

469
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,210
site back to basically

470
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:26,350
the next level up the chain is a line is
a microwave link and encrypting

471
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,910
impeller GCHQ polo cancelled matches

472
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,910
solves that problem you want to talk to
okay

473
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:38,310
part haha that's why I missed this I
came into my life

474
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,780
I've seen advertisements for our secure
GSM phones being

475
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,889
available in Europe which we'll see you
know

476
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,140
for two counts of was wondering if there
are certain regulatory

477
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,550
or just sheer cost inferences that
everything

478
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:57,159
being made available here misstates the
the tiger

479
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,460
inside the sector yeah sexual tiger
thinking and it's now I think approved

480
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,240
for

481
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,860
nato years through secure but that's
done through

482
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,990
secret but not top-secret which is
saying something taking

483
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,940
I am well I know about those Abused
actually

484
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,110
the father relatively expensive like in
the thousands of dollars

485
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,840
they also require call turkey management
facility

486
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,600
so they don't stand alone which is kinda
funny

487
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,890
environment as if you were really
talking about a wartime

488
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,180
I don't really want to have more than I
don't have extra parts that have to sail

489
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:37,360
like if you look at how students removes
in Turkey management feels guilty but

490
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,150
not very often

491
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:43,430
gets a here on occasion listed in the
initial gets its key material

492
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:47,580
but it doesn't have the time to look a
mess again for a long long time months

493
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,550
so in case it came as boom you know we
can still keep talking

494
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,610
stood you had to talk to him every time
so I'm not

495
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,070
I don't know the part of the reason is
that the

496
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,780
may have been doing security is himself
the way it looks to me like you aided me

497
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,200
partnership between phone manufacture
certainly don't want to build your own

498
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,480
phone this can be extremely expensive

499
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,760
again as well people don't pay me
everybody pretty much within the US is

500
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,020
getting subsidized

501
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:17,060
phones will be leaving phone phone goes
for you know if I was free

502
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,480
you know it's all good you know what you
know who knows what the real low-cost

503
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,020
the car the real cost far as I can tell
me what about how the box as well

504
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,740
the the the guy said on the phone some
next level

505
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,860
so let's say that you can sell for the
dawn himself as possible

506
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,590
in the same issues with regard to how
good it sounds because you have to be

507
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,240
today jill

508
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,790
couldn't push its across this thing and
more experienced

509
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:47,159
says the how what can one say that they
shall have really very different numbers

510
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,750
nobody is optimized it that is you know
we think you sent me names in a care

511
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,980
home with that with them

512
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,060
with the lens million open with

513
00:28:56,060 --> 00:29:00,330
yeah right the tiger also has the
resting feature that if you don't

514
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,669
have access to the nation's veterans
server you will follow up with excuses a

515
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,510
little phones

516
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:10,450
according to mister looking as can be
yeah

517
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,740
is is not enough on this one being sold
by Roland Schwarz

518
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,950
which is the the rooms now he's
convinced shop

519
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,650
forum interesting time to put me have

520
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,800
and thats their phones routinely killed
by cement is it seems but its mission

521
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,980
was limited as the crips knowledge

522
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,610
it's also urges yet the g35 cancel

523
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,880
it's it's it's a fairly standard scenes
mom with an extra hardware module

524
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,290
yeah in and I think when I look that one
up they don't tell you what the

525
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,860
you get no info really want the crypto
as it says in how many bits but it

526
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,410
doesn't say

527
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,810
to cancel what's really good straws to

528
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,370
thrusters reaffirmed its really good
I've also heard an Israeli phone I

529
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,200
haven't see haven't heard from some

530
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,650
people steal and seniors in TV
advertising for her there's an israeli

531
00:29:56,650 --> 00:30:00,010
secure phone making him seem to not
mention

532
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:04,000
which was to be instances 10 when
mentioning a little spots should mention

533
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,150
that deals

534
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,190
called opens not eat within the catcher
a

535
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,950
the perfect lol the low-tech in
so-called

536
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,810
with the logo which is far more young

537
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:19,990
thank you say something then the
congresspeople your friends rated they

538
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,800
don't they're

539
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,640
this yes louisiana composers as through
this big scandal

540
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,320
move my way USPS president teaching in
Branson phones

541
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,740
is that there was Ambac's which is a

542
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,710
the company that turns out they provide
other billing services for all

543
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,240
all home the the phone companies in the
US with

544
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,810
they just broke the law turns out it's a
israeli on operational who knows

545
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,409
why they would have been sold but in if
you think what they want to get

546
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:51,490
all the track a complete wrap-up no
Thursday

547
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,530
name someone to the US here will only
one who did you know we're getting all

548
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,899
the traffic you know something then
discovers

549
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,910
who with a bill are the the lawful
intercept equipment

550
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,900
that within mandated by that pollyanna
communications in the law enforcement

551
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,480
action

552
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,490
which is in the running for the working
title for those that the privacy

553
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,860
improvement in

554
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,400
and digital telephony act that was being
least

555
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,540
yet yeah that was never the working
title before that was

556
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:29,190
was details left in seeing privacy
improvement this is that the total the

557
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,850
most important

558
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,040
home okay a question

559
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,090
can bet your Holy Grail again yeah I'm
and

560
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,130
against him out internet pocket you see
some sort of

561
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,800
it with job on the phone possibly an
open source application the phone he

562
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,110
just needs to be

563
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,030
easily getting crypto you don't need a
channel past

564
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:54,800
in question absolutely nothing unusual
yeah me he's moving out the

565
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,540
hearing aid PDA device this is not for
sale in Europe

566
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,950
and their they will they will be for
sale your phone service type this is

567
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,090
has rebranded as well too much just love
the larger carriers for orange

568
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:12,280
England it's called txt ANC it's
basically a bargain PC device and she

569
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,660
can see that type of

570
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,400
was a phone book it has gsm/gprs
telephone

571
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,170
so does package which does dollars on
internet

572
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,240
although the latency on this package
which number is we didn't seem to do

573
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,720
anything

574
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,540
voice-over I'm it also ruled in GSM data
calls

575
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,960
Jan 9600 have a still in seeing the pics
latency

576
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,300
to at least you can talk to each other
and we're in the process of developing

577
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,800
an application for this which will

578
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,830
miss you run the secure telephone to the
organizer for the iPad

579
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,310
part is part of work to do the code a

580
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:50,330
the crypto the key management in the
user interface and we don't need the GSM

581
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,950
part to make it a call

582
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,010
thing about doing on the voice channel
is that the voice channel on the other

583
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,940
wing

584
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,760
gets can bring back into analog and back
into digital artist can count on staying

585
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,950
digital

586
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,090
and since this version is lossy
anticipated 0

587
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,790
can't deal with was lawson's a you would
end up with

588
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:12,920
was no idea so it has to be the data
channel which

589
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:17,100
has been about parts but we're working
on an application to run inside

590
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:20,400
these phones and were going is

591
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,690
we're all going to have whether it's
this network where we're

592
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,390
the next generation as CDMA networks for
the

593
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,740
even the the next generation telephone
mobile telephone networks altogether

594
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,850
we're all going to have phones which are
very capable of running this whole

595
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,510
application software

596
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:39,960
just have to make sure that my time that
we have them

597
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,180
there's no shipbuilding there which a

598
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,540
which doesn't allow running any
obligations which hadn't been for screen

599
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,450
so they don't

600
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,530
became violent violate any digital
rights management schemes

601
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,620
yes is this your baby should be news it
was a

602
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:57,730
yes yes even worse than anything

603
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,169
the many own compositions you can be
having I'm

604
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:04,310
anyway so at the look of these phones

605
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,760
a I'll be talking a little bit more
about six when we discuss

606
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,110
or other projects as well this is what
we're working on and this is where it's

607
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,490
going

608
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,100
this type of phone

609
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,409
we know this year it's here don't don't
find in Kansas

610
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,820
million pretty much that's what I use in

611
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:26,200
it's called its it's the 1983 G-seven
said 900

612
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:33,169
1819 100 and in Europe 3918 100
briseno's is CDMA

613
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:37,080
can so where they live

614
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,649
and with Pennsylvania who knows the name
moisture

615
00:34:40,649 --> 00:34:46,100
became its singular rather than placing

616
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,168
yeah yeah it all depends on where you
are singers

617
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:52,658
singular in my neighborhood is just
simply stream is GSM

618
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,929
right

619
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,430
okay the rising is a is a cDNA operated

620
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,779
right but that would still work yet
another operate from adjacent to the

621
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,150
for this whole thing is it did anything
in answer to the question the back and

622
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,810
rubs it is really

623
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,310
these are converging he is really for us
folks would like to make secure calls

624
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:15,180
what we need is a mars bar on the phone

625
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,049
the bit by he was a bit by enzyme was
burned the phone

626
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:22,350
and access to this because I'm I can get
it done

627
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,450
so the crib goes over well with the
problems

628
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,180
on the phones now I have enough minutes
to read

629
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,399
his team's oftentimes

630
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,270
just is is

631
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:43,130
saying the person who's talking to whom
with HIV and noisy traffic

632
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:46,680
the call said information jobs in the US
is available from

633
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,960
no Union the only any almost look
probably after the Patriot the problems

634
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,860
you have to do is call and ask for
months is very low standard

635
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,630
cop can register it was called law on

636
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,730
the I don't know many did you can use
regular switch to

637
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,030
telephone number they have clearances

638
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:10,070
think there's all kinds of ways but is
it comes to the same mix master

639
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,530
problem people have yes and surprisingly
hard problem

640
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,770
its there's there's zero-knowledge

641
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:20,110
attempted to use to solve the problem in
in

642
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:25,010
context in streaming data and condensate
context is to maintain its its

643
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:29,330
a present pretty much impossible to saw
even with the money bandwidth available

644
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:30,610
on the Internet is still

645
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,530
surely trujillo for a for a determined
attacker to find out

646
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,430
what streams going way thing I'm

647
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,569
luck

648
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:47,170
Montreux talking into the mic right

questions and

656
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:18,540
and one other things was mean in one
senses Street business but the others

657
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:21,950

operation

658
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:28,950

667
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,390
it's not fair to say that the science
behind it

668
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,150
yeah world for themselves behind it and
it's really smart to say

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,560
lowest

672
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,580
thing any if it's an accident of course
they know that they have caused the

673
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,250
problem

674
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:23,560
never do that just like just like the
tall grass

675
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,820
companies in the US promised they would
never do that in a distance

676
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:31,220
knocking out the top dollar it's like
